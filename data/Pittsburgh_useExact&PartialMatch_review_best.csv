Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,we got a sampler and enjoyed everything on it.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"my long-time fave for Ethopian in the PGH, the vegetarian sampler is amazing... as long as the injera is fresh."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"they've also allowed me to be somewhat creative with the menu, picking some of the app options in my veggie sampler (the potato salad is real good)."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"the sampler is served on a flat bread that is also your utensil, enjoy eating with your hands.."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"as a whole, the sampler was cold."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,thoroughly enjoyed the veggie sampler plate.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,I chose the sampler plate which is a good way to get a nice variety of flavors.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"if you're new to Ethiopian cuisine, I highly recommend ordering a sampler, since it provides you with an opportunity to try several dishes and see what you like."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,the sampler was very tasty.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"in addition to the vegetarian sampler being as uniquely delicious as I remembered, the waitress noticed birthday gifts and brought out an ENORMOUS slice of some of the best dark chocolate cake I've ever had."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,I enjoyed the sampler platter.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,they suggested that we order a Tana Sampler which would give us a chance to taste many different dishes that they offer.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"what I had was the Tana sampler with: 
Tana Tibs (lamb) 
Doro Wot (Chicken leg) in the Kay Wot sauce
Yesega Wot (beef) in the Kay Wot sauce
Tikil Gomen (cabbage and carrots) 
Ye Abesha Gomen (collard greens) 
Fossolia (green beans and carrots) 
Injera (Flat spongy bread that the food is served on, the tana sampler also comes with extra on the side) 

You will notice that I mention 6 dishes instead of five."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,we split a sampler and ordered 2 veggie dishes as well as 3 meat dishes.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,tana definitely hits the spot (the veggie sampler is a great value!
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,tana sampler,"the injera beneath the sampler offering becomes somewhat soggy which I didn't particularly care for, so I used the surrounding dry injera for scooping and mixed the remaining sampler ingredients with rice and used a spoon to eat with."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"in a perfect world, they would offer gluten-free injera, like some of the Ethiopian places I've been to in DC, etc."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,*gluten free injera available if you call 3 days in advance* Food was great.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,these were served on top of a large serving of Injera.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"my long-time fave for Ethopian in the PGH, the vegetarian sampler is amazing... as long as the injera is fresh."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"I enjoyed a hodgepodge of vegetarian dishes served both cold and warm, and we received extra injera without having to request it, thanks to our waiter's keen eye."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"it's not worth it now that their staff is no longer welcoming and friendly, and certainly isn't worth it for cold vegetables and charges for one piece of injera to be served with your meal."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,I could have made this injera at my home and have been more satisfied.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,the injera was spot on and the service was pretty good as well.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"all of the food that one orders off of the menu comes piled upon a flat, circular bed of spongy bread called Injera."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"what I had was the Tana sampler with: 
Tana Tibs (lamb) 
Doro Wot (Chicken leg) in the Kay Wot sauce
Yesega Wot (beef) in the Kay Wot sauce
Tikil Gomen (cabbage and carrots) 
Ye Abesha Gomen (collard greens) 
Fossolia (green beans and carrots) 
Injera (Flat spongy bread that the food is served on, the tana sampler also comes with extra on the side) 

You will notice that I mention 6 dishes instead of five."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,I was particularly impressed by the stewed meats more than the vegetables (personal preference I am not a huge fan of stewed vegetables) and found the injera to be a good foil to the heavy flavors and sauces.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,the meals are about $15 and are generous in size and with a great selection (1 meat + any 2 veggies on injera).
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"this one had generous portions of all our favorite dishes, very nice flavor, and excellent, delicious injera."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"b) If you've never had Ethiopian food, it's primarily the following: super tasty, well-seasoned meats and legumes served on a plate of Injera, a spongy pancake-like bread."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"plus, the injera that's been sitting under your entrees is the best!"
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,the kids (3 and 6) enjoyed many of the selections and the experience of eating with injera.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,the injera was actually better than some I've had before.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"food: Tana offers standard Ethiopian cuisine, which is centered around an injera (spongy flat bread) topped with delicious items of your choosing, and the menu also offers multiple appetizers and soups to get you started."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"suffice it so say, the food is delicious, it's fun to eat with your hands, I have dreams about their injera, and you can gorge yourself on flavorful, healthy food."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,my first time to eat Injera and it was good!
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"the whole point of eating Ethiopian food is that it's served family style on injera, this huge piece of flat bread that you tear off and scoop the food up with, using only your hands and no utensils."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"the injera, tana tibs, beet salad, sambusa, and fossolia were flavorful and well portioned."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,the food is served on top of Ethiopian bread called injera and without utensils.
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"the injera beneath the sampler offering becomes somewhat soggy which I didn't particularly care for, so I used the surrounding dry injera for scooping and mixed the remaining sampler ingredients with rice and used a spoon to eat with."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"he loves a good sourdough, so the injera was a hit."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"the injera was the best part of the meal, and the vegetarian options are quite good."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,injera,"tana's usual injera is made with teff, rye, and wheat, not good for my need for gluten free."
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,vegetarian sampler,we got a sampler and enjoyed everything on it.

Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,vegetarian sampler,tana definitely hits the spot (the veggie sampler is a great value!
Tana Ethiopian Cuisine,vegetarian sampler,"the injera beneath the sampler offering becomes somewhat soggy which I didn't particularly care for, so I used the surrounding dry injera for scooping and mixed the remaining sampler ingredients with rice and used a spoon to eat with."

Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"maybe I've just been too spoiled with all the Taiwanese choices in the Washington D.C. area...

My bubble tea was bland, the beef noodle soup wasn't very flavorful, parking was a pain, my boyfriend ordered something supposedly pretty authentic and it didn't come out as expected, and our waiter seemed just a tad rude."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"one, the bubble tea will always be delicious."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,went to the Rose Tea Cafe for some bubble tea and a bite with my fella and had a great experience!
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,we both thoroughly enjoyed our bubble tea (I recommend the coconut black milk - yum!)
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,a good way of ending a meal here -- especially on days when scalding temperatures are reached -- is with a bubble tea.
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,the boba tea is also very good.
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"I do come here often for the boba tea, which is probably the best in the city."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,my favorite is the pork chop over rice with a hard boiled tea egg.
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,pretty much everything is better with that tea egg.
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"the milk teas and the smoothies are always better here, definitely better than Orient Express or Lulu's Noodles, likely because the ingredients are fresher and I just feel that they have more experience making these great drinks."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"overall, Rose Tea is a place that you'll see a lot of Taiwanese students/patrons at, and I think that's a testament to their authenticity and quality."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"I would love to give Rose Tea Cafe a better rating, and if I were rating the food alone, it would certainly be a four or five..."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,i've tried all the tea spots in Pittsburgh so far and Rose Tea Cafe is the best.

Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"honestly, every time I eat at Rose Tea Cafe, I'm happy."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,"however, their bubble tea is probably the best in Pittsburgh, at least of all the ones I had so far."
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,the service in Rose Tea Cafe is horrible.
Rose Tea Cafe,mango green milk tea,an earlier reviewer didn't find Rose Tea authentic enough because they don't serve Taiwanese styled breakfast and because their rendition of ma-po tofu doesn't match her recollection of the canon.
