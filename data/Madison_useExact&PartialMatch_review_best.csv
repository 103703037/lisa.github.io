Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"I KNOW I wrote a review of Mad City Frites a couple of weeks ago.  It's disappeared for some reason.  I'm in a writin' mood, so here goes another.

Interior was spacious, clean and bright, with fun holes in each table for the paper fry-cone holder to sit in.  The lone woman on duty was very nice, and rather excited to bestow the frites upon us!  I take that as a sign of a new business populated by energetic young folk.  Oh, to be in the flower of youth again!

The frites were nice and crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside, with a sprinkle of season salt to spice them up a bit.  We ended up getting three of the dipping sauces: the garlic, the honey-mustard, and the mad sauce.  The garlic was not super flavorful.  It helped to glob the sauce on each bite.  Perhaps more of this sauce is required to accommodate such globbing.  The other two were much better.  The honey-mustard was nice and tangy-sweet (HM is one of my fave combos), and the Mad sauce was really good too.  It's been a few weeks, so I can't remember what was in it exactly, but it was very flavorful, kind of like sweet pepper maybe?  AGHH my memory!  Anyway, I enjoyed these two sauces a lot.

Several reviewers have dinged this place because the frites are ""too thick.""  I wasn't aware that there were standard specs for this kind of fry.  I LIKE thick-cut fries, and this joint does them well as descibed above.  But then, I also like steak fries, so I guess that makes me, what, a philistine?  Probably!

I guess these sort of one-item menu concepts are au courant.  This one makes a lot of sense for a snack mid-afternoon, as I had.  They are open super-late on weekends, so the other obvious time is after-bar for State Street drunkies.  Whatever floats your boat.

I would go again, and probably will soon as I have been having cravings for fries this week and I have to go downtown every day.  Kinda inevitable!

I've never been to Belgium, so I can't speak to how ""authentic"" they are ( I find this term used as a criticism of restaurants to be tendentious and tiresome anyway) but I can say the frites are plenty tasty and satisfying, the portions are good for one, or to share with a friend (unless you're a fat-ass) and the sauces I've had are a nice tasty addition."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"My thoughts on Mad City Frites are pretty similar to what Shruti W. said in her review. The layout is spacious, the ambience is nice, but the frites themselves are lacking. I also felt like they were too thick, and were way too soft than I wanted them to be. I kept hoping to get some crunch in a few of them, but it never happened. Also, while the sauce texture is there, the flavor is not whatsoever. My group ended up getting 4 sauces, and we could not tell the difference between any of them except for the honey mustard. Way too mild of flavor for a sauce that's really thick.

In addition, I feel like the pricing system here needs some improvement. There's two sizes: regular for $4.50, which comes with 1 sauce, and large for $5.50, which comes with two sauces. And then you can get another sauce for $1 (or 3 for $2.50). The large is likely going to be too much for one person to eat (I have a large appetite and finished a large, but my stomach didn't feel great in the end), but getting just 1 sauce is lame (especially with how flavorless they are). So you want to get at least 2. But you feel like you're getting ripped off if you just buy the1 sauce, because you should just get the large then. But if you get the large, then you're going to feel sick/bloated/greasy/fat after you eat it from eating too many fries.  Overall, change the price of extra sauce to 50 cents, because 1) Other places don't charge nearly that much for more sauce (See below), and 2) It would give people incentive to actually get more sauces and not more starch.

And in case you're reading this review because you were searching for places with good fries, here are 3 places that do fries/frites in Madison way better than this place:
Jac's on Monroe Street: You can get a frites basket that has crispier frites, and is the size of MCF's large, for $5, and that comes with an aioli. If you add $1 (the price of 1 sauce at MCF), you get 3 extra sauces, all of which are very tasty. So you can spend $6 at Jac's or $7.50 at MCF for frites and 4 sauces. Easy call to me!
Tipsy Cow on the corner of King/Main: They have a good selection of specialty baskets of fries, ranging from $7-$9. So it's more expensive, but it's meant for sharing, and therefore you get more. Options includes buffalo blue cheese, truffle, carnitas, and many others.
DLUX on MLK Blvd: If you're on more a budget, you can get speciality fries for $3 here for 1, or a basket for $6. Similar to Tipsy Cow, they have Truffle, but they also have sweet potato w/ Sriracha Mayo, a real goodie.

So there you go. In addition, you can get things other than fries at those places, like alcohol and entrees. I would give Mad City Frites a 2.5, but i'm rounding down here because frites are the only thing they do, and I wouldn't put them in the top 5 for Fries in the city, so why I would ever go here?"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"The fact that I live around the corner from this place is highly dangerous. So delicious! My favorite sauce is the game day garlic, although the mad city sauce and the beer cheese sauce are delicious and worth a try as well. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, unlike any fries I've had!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"Simple menu--potatoes and poutine only, and they do it well!

Order your fries (small or large) and choose your sauce. The large included 2 sauces, and ketchup, mayo, and malt vinegar were available at each table. My sauces were garlic and sriracha mayo. Personally, I would have preferred a less citrusy/bright garlic sauce with more of a roasted garlic flavor. My fries were made to order.  For to-go orders, they'll put your cone in a paper bag. 

As for the fries themselves, they were very good.  For frites, a thinner fry than what's available at Mad City is more my preference, although these were excellent.

Restaurant has wi-fi and the tables have handy holes so that you can have your cone upright when you eat. Tip--the lighting is a bit dim. I was almost positive that they were closed when I walked by.

Overall, I recommend!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"Mad City Frites is definitely a nice addition to State St, especially as a place to hang out and catch up with friends or study. They have games, plenty of space, outlets everywhere, and a nice ambiance. I was not a fan of the frites, however.

The place is small but spacious, with some fun little nooks facing State St (perfect for people watching!) and a few comfortably sized tables. You order frites or poutine at the counter, with your choice of sauces (1 or 2 depending on the size of your order). The food is made to order. I tried a large order, which comes with 2 sauces. The sauces I chose were garlic and the Mad Sauce (a tangy-sweet sauce). 

The frites were way too large for my tastes. They were too big and thick to get crispy at all, and after eating a few it was like just eating starch. This could have been redeemed with flavorful sauces, but I found the sauces lightly seasoned and very heavy. Both were aioli-type sauces and were more sweet than savory, which was surprising for the garlic sauce. 

I think Mad City Frites could benefit from offering a thinner cut fry for those of us who enjoy crispier frites. I also feel that beer would be an awesome addition to a place like this, so I hope they are working toward getting an alcohol license! I did enjoy the ambiance here, and would recommend it as a spot to meet up with friends if you don't mind a thicker cut fry."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"Frites is on. 

What can you get? Thick cut double fried fries. With sauces to choose from.

The venue was clean and spacious and I loved the cut out holes in the table so we can put our fries and sauces. 

I wasn't very impressed by the mad sauce but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the fries were, despite being really thick. There was a nice crisp on the outside, and lots of flesh in the inside but yet was not too dense. 

Poutine was not to my liking. Why isn't the cheese curds more melty... And the sauce was too salty with the fries. Need to adjust the amount of salt.

As for variety.. How about some curly fries? Waffle fries? Potato chip? Thin cut frites? 

And I just really want aioli to go with my frites. Thank you very much. 

Verdict: Try it! Great place for snack, but I wish there was more variety on the menu."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,Freshly cut frites served up with a choice of 14 sauces (beyond ketchup & mustard). All ages & demographics enjoying a stroll on State Street for a crispy treat. A little salty for my taste that took away from the sauces. I will be back to try more sauces.
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"If you're craving French fries and like sauce options then come to Mad City Frites. They're some decent quality fries and have a nice quiet atmosphere. There are some party games on a shelf which we made use of and it sends like a good environment to bring your own game and friends to. Maybe make this a stop on your walk down State Street and get some small food items from other restaurants too, like a bar hop for food!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"So delicious! The frites were thick cut, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and piping HOT! The saracha sauce was amazing! They need to bottle that so that I can put it on everything! It is mild but flavorful, not overly spicy. We also tried the garlic lime sauce. It was thick with a mild garlic flavor and the bright touch of lime. Also good, but that saracha sauce... OH MY!  This was my first time trying poutine, so I don't have anything to compare but it was spectacular. Rich gravy and soft cheese curds. It was salty so I can't wait for them to have some beer to pair it with. 
Service was quick and they came to check on us twice. Exceptional service, food, and attention to detail. In fact, I think one of my favorite parts, besides the food, were the holes cut into the tables so that you can place your cone of frites upright. 

I'll be back!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"The barbecue sauce is delicious! Great concept for a quick bite! The tables are special with holes for your fries cone. They have some board games by the window so you can people watch and play as you eat! Very chill atmosphere. I wish they gave me more sauce, but at least the ketchup is free."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"We took our two kids (5.5 & 3) here for a snack on a weekend afternoon in late October.  The ladies working when we went were very nice to the kids (came out and gave them stickers), and us as well.  

The fries were thick and nice and crispy.   There were a lot of smaller bits of fries in the large order I got to share with the kids, which was really my only complaint.  I ordered the 'Big 10 Buffalo"" and ""Madtown Mango"" sauces.  Both were good but I preferred the mango sauce.  A large order comes with two sauces, which seems like it is enough, though the kids probably ate 1/2 of my larger order and they used copious amounts of ketchup.  

My husband ordered the poutine and said it was great.  I had a taste, but it's not really my thing.  He guarantees me that if you like poutine, you'll like theirs.   

I wouldn't treat this as a meal place but for a snack or bar food it seems pretty good.  We would go there again."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,I was craving fries and this was the right spot. The fries were little thicker than my liking. I got sriracha and the sauce was yum. We also got poutine. It's not the best I have ever had but it was pretty decent. Will visit again.
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"This might be a bit snobby, but after spending some time in Belgium last year, I was excited to hear that Madison was getting a Belgian frites place- I could relive my time wandering around eating delicious frites! Mad City Frites, however, did not live up to my expectations. The frites weren't terrible, just nothing special. I went with a group of friends, so we were able to try each others' sauce choices, and these were also good, but nothing exceptional. 
I do like the handy holes in the tables for the cones of frites. They also have a pile of board games, which is a fun idea. 
I really wanted to love this place, but it fell a little short of my expectations."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"Mad City Frites takes fries to a whole new level.  I went with a friend and got a Large sized frites with the number 1 and number 2 sauces, and it was SUPER filling (granted, we went AFTER we ate dinner haha).  I love that their sauces have so much flavor, and that their fries aren't just ""crisps"".  I'm a huge fan of huge potatoey fries so I absolutely loved Mad City's fries.  All their sauces are really good so you really can't go wrong.  Their Mango sauce is slightly sweet, and while mango and fries don't sound like they go together, they actually do.  The garlic is very garlicy and not too salty, and again tastes great.  One tip though, if you get a large, BRING A FRIEND TO EAT IT WITH.  It is definitely a lot of fries.  My only caveat with this place is that two sauces isn't enough for 1 large sized fries (especially if you really like sauces)."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,Cool concept. The fries and the sauces are delicious--my friends and I got a bunch of different ones... the garlic/rosemary and the madcity sauce were my favs. But be forewarned... this is literally just fries and sauces to dip them in. Nothing fancy.
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"You say ""fried potatoes"" and I'm interested! While I've not been to Belgium, I do consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fries, frites, and chips, and I've got to say these are different from any I've had here in town.

Thick-cut, almost meaty, skin on frites tossed in seasoned salt, served hot and fresh. Could it get better? Add some ""game day garlic"" sauce or malt vinegar, and yes, it can. I loved the garlic sauce-- thick and flavorful. Also tried the beer cheese dip made with PBR, served warm, which was good. You could really taste the beer!

My friend and I thought picking up an order of frites would be a good side to our lunch, but really they could be a meal in themselves.

The atmosphere is nice and clean. The tables have holes for you to set your paper frite cone in, which is awesome. And they're working on implementing an automated ordering system which is pretty cool.

We met the owner (and her mom) and they were both so very nice! I am excited to go back soon!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"I had not previously had frites before my trip to Mad City, so I can't speak on authenticity or compare them to others around town. I can say that they were tasty and crazy filling. Having never been before and making the awesome, adult life choice to eat fries for dinner, my boyfriend and I each ordered a large frites. A small order comes with one sauce, and a large comes with two - as a sauce lover, I figured I might as well just go for the large since it was the same cost as a small with an extra sauce. I did not need a large. My boyfriend and I could have easily split one. Having four sauces, though, was awesome. I regret nothing. 

Mad Sauce - their signature, I couldn't put my finger on the exact flavor but I'm guessing it was ketchup, mayo, and maybe something else. 
Game Day Garlic - I want all the garlic, and sadly this mostly just tasted like a sweet mayo. 
Bascom Hill BBQ - tasty, thick barbecue sauce. 
Isthmus Honey Mustard - one of the best honey mustards I've had. A really good balance. Probably my favorite of the four, which surprised me. 

The frites themselves were extra thick and extra crispy. The insides were creamy and piping hot. Like, insanely hot. Due to the thick crust they stayed hot for the duration. It's a double-edged sword - nobody likes cold fries, but it's also nice to not burn your mouth. Snapping the frites in half helped let the steam escape and come down to an acceptable temperature. 

Looking forward to trying a few more of their sauces!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"Every time we go here we load up on sauces. If you have a friend, split a large frite, and double down on the sauces. Grateful Red pepper aioli is the best. It's my favorite. We also get Game day Garlic, Mad Sauce, and a few from Sauce of the week (can't remember off hand though) If I'm going to get take out, I usually like to get a whole meal, but when I'm craving fries, I'm going to Mad City frites. They're also on the Hooked App so you're also able to get a deal if they post it. Nothing like good food with a discount."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"Oooooh yes, this is one of the good ones. IMO, the State Street area has always been kind of lacking in non-food cart, non-sit down/dine in snack places. There are some, and it's expanding, but not much else as you move toward the Square.

Enter Mad City Frites. As others have said, they only do one thing - but they do it well. If you're looking for hot, perfectly textured fries with delicious dipping sauce or some good poutine, get here. Plus, cool design stuff: the tables have little holes in them for the fry cones!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"They are located right in the middle of State St. They are open late. They serve thick hand cut fries and poutine. Need I say more?

A small order of the fries comes with choice of one sauce while the large version comes with two. Of course you can always ask for additional sauce for an extra charge. For me the small is perfect, sometimes it might even be too much, depending on how hungry I am.

My favorite sauce is the madtown mango, mango chutney aioli with garlic and lemon. There's a reason why this sauce is the first one on their list, number 1. Poutine is also great, made with Wisconsin cheddar and gravy *yum yum*

For those looking to spend the afternoon or a couple hours with friends munching on fries, there are plenty of games in store to keep you occupied."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,Great Friday night spot for me and my three year old daughter :-)  Mango sauce was delicious and frites had just the right amount of seasoning.  Very friendly service.  Lots of tables since they didn't have beer and wine available which is a must on State Street but in the mean time good time to try it before the outdoor seating gets sparse.
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"Delicious.
Perfect.
I will get them every time I walk downtown Madison.
I had the Mad City sauce!
Best fries in Madison. And I know fries."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"FRITES ON POINT. 

GENERAL: Great flavor, check the specials card for even more sauce variety, order 'em how you like 'em (extra crispy for me), check apps for frequent coupons/deals/steals!

I love love LOVE fried potatoes of any kind. These ones are delicious. Once you order, your frites are made fresh, which is always an added bonus.

FLAVOR: the seasoning is BOMB--a great combination of salty, tangy, smoky, garlicky, and every other delicious flavor you can imagine. There are maybe 10-15 sauces that you can choose from, and while I've enjoyed every one that I've had, the biggest standout for me is the sconnie sriracha. PRO TIP: don't get 100% set on your sauce decision based on the menu board; there are monthly specials on cards located up at the register. My favorite sauce so far has been the Roasted Red Pepper Aioli, which was a special sauce for this month. 

TEXTURE: texture hasn't always been totally consistent for me here--sometimes I get a crisper order, sometimes I get a softer one, but every time, there are a handful of really crisp little guys that are my favorite. Don't be afraid to tell them what you like! I've learned that they key is to order them extra crispy or ""well-done"" so that I get all of my frites just the way that I like em! 

PRICING: They definitely need to change this up--how? I'm not sure, but it doesn't make THAT much sense the way they have it now. They're not overpriced by any means, but it is a bit strange. The regular size is priced at $4.50, and it comes with one sauce. Large is $5.50 and comes with two sauces. Additional sauces can be purchased for $1.00 a piece or $2.50 for a combo of three sauces. If you're a sauce lover like me, you'll need an extra sauce no matter which size you go with...and while I'm not a fan of wasting food, at times it seems like it might be most cost-effective to just upgrade to the large for the extra ""free"" sauce and then get rid of whatever frites I don't eat. There are generally coupons on apps like Hooked that will get you a discount of some sort though, so that comes in handy for me a lot.

STAFF: The staff here is phenomenal. They are happy to answer questions and they're always polite, upbeat, and happy. I've seen them when I'm sober and I've seen them while I'm on the verge of blacking out, and they've always been kind and helpful. 

ATMOSPHERE: Urban chic, with specialty tables that have holes to insert your fry-cones into! It's a great place to stop in off of state street. You can hang out with friends and play a board game from their selection, sit by the window and people-watch, or just chill out and enjoy your frites!

5 stars! I hope this place sticks around for a long time!!!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"When it comes to frites, this is pretty fantastic.  My husband and I stopped here after doing some Christmas shopping on State St.  It was pretty empty when we got there around 1:15 PM.  We ordered a large frites with the #4 (queso) and #9 sauces.  Our frites came out piping hot pretty quickly.  I thought they were cooked well, seasoned well and the sauces were excellent.  There was just enough of the sauce to finish out the frites.  The portion size was great and the price was proportionate to the amount of frites we got.  Filled us up so much, we decided that was lunch!
I'd definitely come here again to try out more of the sauces."
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"If you are only going to do one thing in your restaurant, you better do it right.  In the case of Mad City Frites, I was expecting more and got less. 
I thought the fries themselves were perfectly cooked-crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside.  Complaint #1-Why put seasoning salt on the fries?  They change the flavor and clashes with the sauces.  Simple salt works just fine.  Complaint #2-The sauces didn't hit the mark.  With a small order, you get a choice on one sauce.  With a large, you get 2.  So, of course, we opted for the large.
With the choice of 10 sauces, we opted for the Game Day Garlic and Sconnie Sriracha.  The game day garlic was light on the garlic and heavy on the lemon.  The sriracha sauce was spicy but didn't real bring anything else to the table.  I was also surprised they didn't just offer a simple aioli.  Remember guys, sometimes less is more.
I was pleased to see they will be bringing wine and beer to the menu as I think this will be received well.
Sober, I probably won't be back.  After few beers and without any other options available, well then, all bets are off!"
Mad City Frites,6. isthmus honey mustard sauce,"My wife and I each ordered a regular size with an extra dipping sauce. This turned out to be more food then I thought, almost enough for a full meal.

The fries were seasoned very well with seasoned salt and came out in just a few minutes. Most of the fries were well cooked but there was an undercooked one or two in my cone. I had the mango and the teriyaki sauces. Both of the sauces were thick white sauces. They both tasted good, but they didn't taste like mango or teriyaki. My wife and I couldn't even agree which was which. The sauces were labeled on top and the one label appeared smudged. I'm curious if we possible got one wrong sauce.  The two sauces my wife got were better, but I don't remember what they were.

The decor was simple, but nice. The tables with the custom holes for your fries are fun and I always enjoy window seating on State, which there is plenty of. 

It's worth the trip and something refreshingly new to town."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Be noted: this place ONLY serves French fries. Now that that is out of the way, I really liked it! The dips are nice, garlic aioli is my favorite. I didn't know there were so many ways to make fries! 
 My friends and I each got a different type and shared, it was a fun easy snack that we enjoyed while sitting in their out door seating area while people watching."

Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Mad City Frites is definitely a nice addition to State St, especially as a place to hang out and catch up with friends or study. They have games, plenty of space, outlets everywhere, and a nice ambiance. I was not a fan of the frites, however.

The place is small but spacious, with some fun little nooks facing State St (perfect for people watching!) and a few comfortably sized tables. You order frites or poutine at the counter, with your choice of sauces (1 or 2 depending on the size of your order). The food is made to order. I tried a large order, which comes with 2 sauces. The sauces I chose were garlic and the Mad Sauce (a tangy-sweet sauce). 

The frites were way too large for my tastes. They were too big and thick to get crispy at all, and after eating a few it was like just eating starch. This could have been redeemed with flavorful sauces, but I found the sauces lightly seasoned and very heavy. Both were aioli-type sauces and were more sweet than savory, which was surprising for the garlic sauce. 

I think Mad City Frites could benefit from offering a thinner cut fry for those of us who enjoy crispier frites. I also feel that beer would be an awesome addition to a place like this, so I hope they are working toward getting an alcohol license! I did enjoy the ambiance here, and would recommend it as a spot to meet up with friends if you don't mind a thicker cut fry."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Frites is on. 

What can you get? Thick cut double fried fries. With sauces to choose from.

The venue was clean and spacious and I loved the cut out holes in the table so we can put our fries and sauces. 

I wasn't very impressed by the mad sauce but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the fries were, despite being really thick. There was a nice crisp on the outside, and lots of flesh in the inside but yet was not too dense. 

Poutine was not to my liking. Why isn't the cheese curds more melty... And the sauce was too salty with the fries. Need to adjust the amount of salt.

As for variety.. How about some curly fries? Waffle fries? Potato chip? Thin cut frites? 

And I just really want aioli to go with my frites. Thank you very much. 

Verdict: Try it! Great place for snack, but I wish there was more variety on the menu."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"If you're craving French fries and like sauce options then come to Mad City Frites. They're some decent quality fries and have a nice quiet atmosphere. There are some party games on a shelf which we made use of and it sends like a good environment to bring your own game and friends to. Maybe make this a stop on your walk down State Street and get some small food items from other restaurants too, like a bar hop for food!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"So delicious! The frites were thick cut, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and piping HOT! The saracha sauce was amazing! They need to bottle that so that I can put it on everything! It is mild but flavorful, not overly spicy. We also tried the garlic lime sauce. It was thick with a mild garlic flavor and the bright touch of lime. Also good, but that saracha sauce... OH MY!  This was my first time trying poutine, so I don't have anything to compare but it was spectacular. Rich gravy and soft cheese curds. It was salty so I can't wait for them to have some beer to pair it with. 
Service was quick and they came to check on us twice. Exceptional service, food, and attention to detail. In fact, I think one of my favorite parts, besides the food, were the holes cut into the tables so that you can place your cone of frites upright. 

I'll be back!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"The barbecue sauce is delicious! Great concept for a quick bite! The tables are special with holes for your fries cone. They have some board games by the window so you can people watch and play as you eat! Very chill atmosphere. I wish they gave me more sauce, but at least the ketchup is free."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"We took our two kids (5.5 & 3) here for a snack on a weekend afternoon in late October.  The ladies working when we went were very nice to the kids (came out and gave them stickers), and us as well.  

The fries were thick and nice and crispy.   There were a lot of smaller bits of fries in the large order I got to share with the kids, which was really my only complaint.  I ordered the 'Big 10 Buffalo"" and ""Madtown Mango"" sauces.  Both were good but I preferred the mango sauce.  A large order comes with two sauces, which seems like it is enough, though the kids probably ate 1/2 of my larger order and they used copious amounts of ketchup.  

My husband ordered the poutine and said it was great.  I had a taste, but it's not really my thing.  He guarantees me that if you like poutine, you'll like theirs.   

I wouldn't treat this as a meal place but for a snack or bar food it seems pretty good.  We would go there again."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,I was craving fries and this was the right spot. The fries were little thicker than my liking. I got sriracha and the sauce was yum. We also got poutine. It's not the best I have ever had but it was pretty decent. Will visit again.
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"This might be a bit snobby, but after spending some time in Belgium last year, I was excited to hear that Madison was getting a Belgian frites place- I could relive my time wandering around eating delicious frites! Mad City Frites, however, did not live up to my expectations. The frites weren't terrible, just nothing special. I went with a group of friends, so we were able to try each others' sauce choices, and these were also good, but nothing exceptional. 
I do like the handy holes in the tables for the cones of frites. They also have a pile of board games, which is a fun idea. 
I really wanted to love this place, but it fell a little short of my expectations."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Mad City Frites takes fries to a whole new level.  I went with a friend and got a Large sized frites with the number 1 and number 2 sauces, and it was SUPER filling (granted, we went AFTER we ate dinner haha).  I love that their sauces have so much flavor, and that their fries aren't just ""crisps"".  I'm a huge fan of huge potatoey fries so I absolutely loved Mad City's fries.  All their sauces are really good so you really can't go wrong.  Their Mango sauce is slightly sweet, and while mango and fries don't sound like they go together, they actually do.  The garlic is very garlicy and not too salty, and again tastes great.  One tip though, if you get a large, BRING A FRIEND TO EAT IT WITH.  It is definitely a lot of fries.  My only caveat with this place is that two sauces isn't enough for 1 large sized fries (especially if you really like sauces)."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,Cool concept. The fries and the sauces are delicious--my friends and I got a bunch of different ones... the garlic/rosemary and the madcity sauce were my favs. But be forewarned... this is literally just fries and sauces to dip them in. Nothing fancy.
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"You say ""fried potatoes"" and I'm interested! While I've not been to Belgium, I do consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fries, frites, and chips, and I've got to say these are different from any I've had here in town.

Thick-cut, almost meaty, skin on frites tossed in seasoned salt, served hot and fresh. Could it get better? Add some ""game day garlic"" sauce or malt vinegar, and yes, it can. I loved the garlic sauce-- thick and flavorful. Also tried the beer cheese dip made with PBR, served warm, which was good. You could really taste the beer!

My friend and I thought picking up an order of frites would be a good side to our lunch, but really they could be a meal in themselves.

The atmosphere is nice and clean. The tables have holes for you to set your paper frite cone in, which is awesome. And they're working on implementing an automated ordering system which is pretty cool.

We met the owner (and her mom) and they were both so very nice! I am excited to go back soon!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"I had not previously had frites before my trip to Mad City, so I can't speak on authenticity or compare them to others around town. I can say that they were tasty and crazy filling. Having never been before and making the awesome, adult life choice to eat fries for dinner, my boyfriend and I each ordered a large frites. A small order comes with one sauce, and a large comes with two - as a sauce lover, I figured I might as well just go for the large since it was the same cost as a small with an extra sauce. I did not need a large. My boyfriend and I could have easily split one. Having four sauces, though, was awesome. I regret nothing. 

Mad Sauce - their signature, I couldn't put my finger on the exact flavor but I'm guessing it was ketchup, mayo, and maybe something else. 
Game Day Garlic - I want all the garlic, and sadly this mostly just tasted like a sweet mayo. 
Bascom Hill BBQ - tasty, thick barbecue sauce. 
Isthmus Honey Mustard - one of the best honey mustards I've had. A really good balance. Probably my favorite of the four, which surprised me. 

The frites themselves were extra thick and extra crispy. The insides were creamy and piping hot. Like, insanely hot. Due to the thick crust they stayed hot for the duration. It's a double-edged sword - nobody likes cold fries, but it's also nice to not burn your mouth. Snapping the frites in half helped let the steam escape and come down to an acceptable temperature. 

Looking forward to trying a few more of their sauces!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Every time we go here we load up on sauces. If you have a friend, split a large frite, and double down on the sauces. Grateful Red pepper aioli is the best. It's my favorite. We also get Game day Garlic, Mad Sauce, and a few from Sauce of the week (can't remember off hand though) If I'm going to get take out, I usually like to get a whole meal, but when I'm craving fries, I'm going to Mad City frites. They're also on the Hooked App so you're also able to get a deal if they post it. Nothing like good food with a discount."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Three months later and MCF is better than ever! I am enjoying the new additions to the menu, especially the wasabi ginger aioli! So delicious! I just wish that there would be *weekly* specials as I have already tried all of the sauces!

Game Day Garlic, Campus Queso, Sconnie Siracha, and Madtown Mango are definitely the favorites for me. Reasonable prices, excellent service, a great atmosphere, and being able to pay with Red Card keep me coming back week after week!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Oooooh yes, this is one of the good ones. IMO, the State Street area has always been kind of lacking in non-food cart, non-sit down/dine in snack places. There are some, and it's expanding, but not much else as you move toward the Square.

Enter Mad City Frites. As others have said, they only do one thing - but they do it well. If you're looking for hot, perfectly textured fries with delicious dipping sauce or some good poutine, get here. Plus, cool design stuff: the tables have little holes in them for the fry cones!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"They are located right in the middle of State St. They are open late. They serve thick hand cut fries and poutine. Need I say more?

A small order of the fries comes with choice of one sauce while the large version comes with two. Of course you can always ask for additional sauce for an extra charge. For me the small is perfect, sometimes it might even be too much, depending on how hungry I am.

My favorite sauce is the madtown mango, mango chutney aioli with garlic and lemon. There's a reason why this sauce is the first one on their list, number 1. Poutine is also great, made with Wisconsin cheddar and gravy *yum yum*

For those looking to spend the afternoon or a couple hours with friends munching on fries, there are plenty of games in store to keep you occupied."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,Great Friday night spot for me and my three year old daughter :-)  Mango sauce was delicious and frites had just the right amount of seasoning.  Very friendly service.  Lots of tables since they didn't have beer and wine available which is a must on State Street but in the mean time good time to try it before the outdoor seating gets sparse.
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"Delicious.
Perfect.
I will get them every time I walk downtown Madison.
I had the Mad City sauce!
Best fries in Madison. And I know fries."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"FRITES ON POINT. 

GENERAL: Great flavor, check the specials card for even more sauce variety, order 'em how you like 'em (extra crispy for me), check apps for frequent coupons/deals/steals!

I love love LOVE fried potatoes of any kind. These ones are delicious. Once you order, your frites are made fresh, which is always an added bonus.

FLAVOR: the seasoning is BOMB--a great combination of salty, tangy, smoky, garlicky, and every other delicious flavor you can imagine. There are maybe 10-15 sauces that you can choose from, and while I've enjoyed every one that I've had, the biggest standout for me is the sconnie sriracha. PRO TIP: don't get 100% set on your sauce decision based on the menu board; there are monthly specials on cards located up at the register. My favorite sauce so far has been the Roasted Red Pepper Aioli, which was a special sauce for this month. 

TEXTURE: texture hasn't always been totally consistent for me here--sometimes I get a crisper order, sometimes I get a softer one, but every time, there are a handful of really crisp little guys that are my favorite. Don't be afraid to tell them what you like! I've learned that they key is to order them extra crispy or ""well-done"" so that I get all of my frites just the way that I like em! 

PRICING: They definitely need to change this up--how? I'm not sure, but it doesn't make THAT much sense the way they have it now. They're not overpriced by any means, but it is a bit strange. The regular size is priced at $4.50, and it comes with one sauce. Large is $5.50 and comes with two sauces. Additional sauces can be purchased for $1.00 a piece or $2.50 for a combo of three sauces. If you're a sauce lover like me, you'll need an extra sauce no matter which size you go with...and while I'm not a fan of wasting food, at times it seems like it might be most cost-effective to just upgrade to the large for the extra ""free"" sauce and then get rid of whatever frites I don't eat. There are generally coupons on apps like Hooked that will get you a discount of some sort though, so that comes in handy for me a lot.

STAFF: The staff here is phenomenal. They are happy to answer questions and they're always polite, upbeat, and happy. I've seen them when I'm sober and I've seen them while I'm on the verge of blacking out, and they've always been kind and helpful. 

ATMOSPHERE: Urban chic, with specialty tables that have holes to insert your fry-cones into! It's a great place to stop in off of state street. You can hang out with friends and play a board game from their selection, sit by the window and people-watch, or just chill out and enjoy your frites!

5 stars! I hope this place sticks around for a long time!!!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"When it comes to frites, this is pretty fantastic.  My husband and I stopped here after doing some Christmas shopping on State St.  It was pretty empty when we got there around 1:15 PM.  We ordered a large frites with the #4 (queso) and #9 sauces.  Our frites came out piping hot pretty quickly.  I thought they were cooked well, seasoned well and the sauces were excellent.  There was just enough of the sauce to finish out the frites.  The portion size was great and the price was proportionate to the amount of frites we got.  Filled us up so much, we decided that was lunch!
I'd definitely come here again to try out more of the sauces."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"If you are only going to do one thing in your restaurant, you better do it right.  In the case of Mad City Frites, I was expecting more and got less. 
I thought the fries themselves were perfectly cooked-crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside.  Complaint #1-Why put seasoning salt on the fries?  They change the flavor and clashes with the sauces.  Simple salt works just fine.  Complaint #2-The sauces didn't hit the mark.  With a small order, you get a choice on one sauce.  With a large, you get 2.  So, of course, we opted for the large.
With the choice of 10 sauces, we opted for the Game Day Garlic and Sconnie Sriracha.  The game day garlic was light on the garlic and heavy on the lemon.  The sriracha sauce was spicy but didn't real bring anything else to the table.  I was also surprised they didn't just offer a simple aioli.  Remember guys, sometimes less is more.
I was pleased to see they will be bringing wine and beer to the menu as I think this will be received well.
Sober, I probably won't be back.  After few beers and without any other options available, well then, all bets are off!"
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"I grew up in Belgium. Frites are important to me and I was extremely excited to see this charming little eatery open on State street. I was there the day it opened. I was probably one of their first customer. I understand the approach. A Madison/College Town spin on a classic Belgian friterie. It's actually a good concept. There's a reason Belgian-style frites are the new hip thing. The restaurant itself is very well thought out, from board games to holes in the tables to hold your ""cornet de frites"". The problem is the actual food. It's a one item menu. The execution should be perfect or close to it anyways. Unfortunately execution fell short of the mark. 
The fries themselves feel like a sophomoric attempt at replicating something someone tasted once and then looked up online. The person behind the concept, while well intentioned, clearly has no respect for the product. A frie should be golden and crisp on the outside and silky smooth inside. What Mad City Frites offers is a shadow that vaguely reminds you of what you think you tasted once in a Belgian restaurant. The fries are sometimes crispy but often collapse under their own weight. The rustic approach of using the traditional Belgian ""Cornet"" (newspaper rolled into a cone) instead of plates does little to absorb the sogginess. The seasoning salt was born out of concept but it just feels like someone is trying to hide the food under a familiar taste and then call it creative.
As a frites connoisseur, I felt disappointed; as a cook, I was outraged. The website claims to fry the fries twice in order to attain a crispy outside and a creamy inside. The problem is that the traditional technique does not end there. Each bath the batch of fries go through must have precise but different temperatures. The establishment is apparently quite content with quickly dipping the batch twice in the same temperature oil. This is another aspect that is often misunderstood, oil is a poor replacement for saindoux fat, or pork fat. This gives the fries an unmistakable taste and an unmatchable crispness.  This last point is not so relevant since pork fat is not readily available in large quantities and a small establishment would have a very hard time procuring it at a reasonable cost. It would also probably be unsuitable for vegetarians. However, since I'm being precise, I thought I would point it out.
The sauces are ok. Unlike previous reviewers, I didn't mind them. While a purist would prefer homemade mayonnaise or aioli, Belgian friteries famously cover their counters with myriads of various sauces. The flavor, while I wouldn't call it ""bold"" certainly will put a smile on your face. The sauces are very specifically designed for the student crowd and I understood that right away, so I wasn't taken back in any way.
Knowing that experiences at new restaurants can vary greatly, I returned to the establishment three times after my first visit. Each time was a different day of the week and a different time of the day and I found my experience to be quite similar each time. Unfortunately. This review really breaks my heart because I was genuinely excited to try this new place."
Mad City Frites,11. grateful red pepper aioli sauce,"My wife and I each ordered a regular size with an extra dipping sauce. This turned out to be more food then I thought, almost enough for a full meal.

The fries were seasoned very well with seasoned salt and came out in just a few minutes. Most of the fries were well cooked but there was an undercooked one or two in my cone. I had the mango and the teriyaki sauces. Both of the sauces were thick white sauces. They both tasted good, but they didn't taste like mango or teriyaki. My wife and I couldn't even agree which was which. The sauces were labeled on top and the one label appeared smudged. I'm curious if we possible got one wrong sauce.  The two sauces my wife got were better, but I don't remember what they were.

The decor was simple, but nice. The tables with the custom holes for your fries are fun and I always enjoy window seating on State, which there is plenty of. 

It's worth the trip and something refreshingly new to town."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"I KNOW I wrote a review of Mad City Frites a couple of weeks ago.  It's disappeared for some reason.  I'm in a writin' mood, so here goes another.

Interior was spacious, clean and bright, with fun holes in each table for the paper fry-cone holder to sit in.  The lone woman on duty was very nice, and rather excited to bestow the frites upon us!  I take that as a sign of a new business populated by energetic young folk.  Oh, to be in the flower of youth again!

The frites were nice and crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside, with a sprinkle of season salt to spice them up a bit.  We ended up getting three of the dipping sauces: the garlic, the honey-mustard, and the mad sauce.  The garlic was not super flavorful.  It helped to glob the sauce on each bite.  Perhaps more of this sauce is required to accommodate such globbing.  The other two were much better.  The honey-mustard was nice and tangy-sweet (HM is one of my fave combos), and the Mad sauce was really good too.  It's been a few weeks, so I can't remember what was in it exactly, but it was very flavorful, kind of like sweet pepper maybe?  AGHH my memory!  Anyway, I enjoyed these two sauces a lot.

Several reviewers have dinged this place because the frites are ""too thick.""  I wasn't aware that there were standard specs for this kind of fry.  I LIKE thick-cut fries, and this joint does them well as descibed above.  But then, I also like steak fries, so I guess that makes me, what, a philistine?  Probably!

I guess these sort of one-item menu concepts are au courant.  This one makes a lot of sense for a snack mid-afternoon, as I had.  They are open super-late on weekends, so the other obvious time is after-bar for State Street drunkies.  Whatever floats your boat.

I would go again, and probably will soon as I have been having cravings for fries this week and I have to go downtown every day.  Kinda inevitable!

I've never been to Belgium, so I can't speak to how ""authentic"" they are ( I find this term used as a criticism of restaurants to be tendentious and tiresome anyway) but I can say the frites are plenty tasty and satisfying, the portions are good for one, or to share with a friend (unless you're a fat-ass) and the sauces I've had are a nice tasty addition."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"My thoughts on Mad City Frites are pretty similar to what Shruti W. said in her review. The layout is spacious, the ambience is nice, but the frites themselves are lacking. I also felt like they were too thick, and were way too soft than I wanted them to be. I kept hoping to get some crunch in a few of them, but it never happened. Also, while the sauce texture is there, the flavor is not whatsoever. My group ended up getting 4 sauces, and we could not tell the difference between any of them except for the honey mustard. Way too mild of flavor for a sauce that's really thick.

In addition, I feel like the pricing system here needs some improvement. There's two sizes: regular for $4.50, which comes with 1 sauce, and large for $5.50, which comes with two sauces. And then you can get another sauce for $1 (or 3 for $2.50). The large is likely going to be too much for one person to eat (I have a large appetite and finished a large, but my stomach didn't feel great in the end), but getting just 1 sauce is lame (especially with how flavorless they are). So you want to get at least 2. But you feel like you're getting ripped off if you just buy the1 sauce, because you should just get the large then. But if you get the large, then you're going to feel sick/bloated/greasy/fat after you eat it from eating too many fries.  Overall, change the price of extra sauce to 50 cents, because 1) Other places don't charge nearly that much for more sauce (See below), and 2) It would give people incentive to actually get more sauces and not more starch.

And in case you're reading this review because you were searching for places with good fries, here are 3 places that do fries/frites in Madison way better than this place:
Jac's on Monroe Street: You can get a frites basket that has crispier frites, and is the size of MCF's large, for $5, and that comes with an aioli. If you add $1 (the price of 1 sauce at MCF), you get 3 extra sauces, all of which are very tasty. So you can spend $6 at Jac's or $7.50 at MCF for frites and 4 sauces. Easy call to me!
Tipsy Cow on the corner of King/Main: They have a good selection of specialty baskets of fries, ranging from $7-$9. So it's more expensive, but it's meant for sharing, and therefore you get more. Options includes buffalo blue cheese, truffle, carnitas, and many others.
DLUX on MLK Blvd: If you're on more a budget, you can get speciality fries for $3 here for 1, or a basket for $6. Similar to Tipsy Cow, they have Truffle, but they also have sweet potato w/ Sriracha Mayo, a real goodie.

So there you go. In addition, you can get things other than fries at those places, like alcohol and entrees. I would give Mad City Frites a 2.5, but i'm rounding down here because frites are the only thing they do, and I wouldn't put them in the top 5 for Fries in the city, so why I would ever go here?"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"The fact that I live around the corner from this place is highly dangerous. So delicious! My favorite sauce is the game day garlic, although the mad city sauce and the beer cheese sauce are delicious and worth a try as well. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, unlike any fries I've had!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"Simple menu--potatoes and poutine only, and they do it well!

Order your fries (small or large) and choose your sauce. The large included 2 sauces, and ketchup, mayo, and malt vinegar were available at each table. My sauces were garlic and sriracha mayo. Personally, I would have preferred a less citrusy/bright garlic sauce with more of a roasted garlic flavor. My fries were made to order.  For to-go orders, they'll put your cone in a paper bag. 

As for the fries themselves, they were very good.  For frites, a thinner fry than what's available at Mad City is more my preference, although these were excellent.

Restaurant has wi-fi and the tables have handy holes so that you can have your cone upright when you eat. Tip--the lighting is a bit dim. I was almost positive that they were closed when I walked by.

Overall, I recommend!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"Mad City Frites is definitely a nice addition to State St, especially as a place to hang out and catch up with friends or study. They have games, plenty of space, outlets everywhere, and a nice ambiance. I was not a fan of the frites, however.

The place is small but spacious, with some fun little nooks facing State St (perfect for people watching!) and a few comfortably sized tables. You order frites or poutine at the counter, with your choice of sauces (1 or 2 depending on the size of your order). The food is made to order. I tried a large order, which comes with 2 sauces. The sauces I chose were garlic and the Mad Sauce (a tangy-sweet sauce). 

The frites were way too large for my tastes. They were too big and thick to get crispy at all, and after eating a few it was like just eating starch. This could have been redeemed with flavorful sauces, but I found the sauces lightly seasoned and very heavy. Both were aioli-type sauces and were more sweet than savory, which was surprising for the garlic sauce. 

I think Mad City Frites could benefit from offering a thinner cut fry for those of us who enjoy crispier frites. I also feel that beer would be an awesome addition to a place like this, so I hope they are working toward getting an alcohol license! I did enjoy the ambiance here, and would recommend it as a spot to meet up with friends if you don't mind a thicker cut fry."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"Frites is on. 

What can you get? Thick cut double fried fries. With sauces to choose from.

The venue was clean and spacious and I loved the cut out holes in the table so we can put our fries and sauces. 

I wasn't very impressed by the mad sauce but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the fries were, despite being really thick. There was a nice crisp on the outside, and lots of flesh in the inside but yet was not too dense. 

Poutine was not to my liking. Why isn't the cheese curds more melty... And the sauce was too salty with the fries. Need to adjust the amount of salt.

As for variety.. How about some curly fries? Waffle fries? Potato chip? Thin cut frites? 

And I just really want aioli to go with my frites. Thank you very much. 

Verdict: Try it! Great place for snack, but I wish there was more variety on the menu."

There are some party games on a shelf which we made use of and it sends like a good environment to bring your own game and friends to. Maybe make this a stop on your walk down State Street and get some small food items from other restaurants too, like a bar hop for food!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"So delicious! The frites were thick cut, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and piping HOT! The saracha sauce was amazing! They need to bottle that so that I can put it on everything! It is mild but flavorful, not overly spicy. We also tried the garlic lime sauce. It was thick with a mild garlic flavor and the bright touch of lime. Also good, but that saracha sauce... OH MY!  This was my first time trying poutine, so I don't have anything to compare but it was spectacular. Rich gravy and soft cheese curds. It was salty so I can't wait for them to have some beer to pair it with. 
Service was quick and they came to check on us twice. Exceptional service, food, and attention to detail. In fact, I think one of my favorite parts, besides the food, were the holes cut into the tables so that you can place your cone of frites upright. 

I'll be back!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"The barbecue sauce is delicious! Great concept for a quick bite! The tables are special with holes for your fries cone. They have some board games by the window so you can people watch and play as you eat! Very chill atmosphere. I wish they gave me more sauce, but at least the ketchup is free."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"We took our two kids (5.5 & 3) here for a snack on a weekend afternoon in late October.  The ladies working when we went were very nice to the kids (came out and gave them stickers), and us as well.  

The fries were thick and nice and crispy.   There were a lot of smaller bits of fries in the large order I got to share with the kids, which was really my only complaint.  I ordered the 'Big 10 Buffalo"" and ""Madtown Mango"" sauces.  Both were good but I preferred the mango sauce.  A large order comes with two sauces, which seems like it is enough, though the kids probably ate 1/2 of my larger order and they used copious amounts of ketchup.  

My husband ordered the poutine and said it was great.  I had a taste, but it's not really my thing.  He guarantees me that if you like poutine, you'll like theirs.   

I wouldn't treat this as a meal place but for a snack or bar food it seems pretty good.  We would go there again."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,I was craving fries and this was the right spot. The fries were little thicker than my liking. I got sriracha and the sauce was yum. We also got poutine. It's not the best I have ever had but it was pretty decent. Will visit again.
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"This might be a bit snobby, but after spending some time in Belgium last year, I was excited to hear that Madison was getting a Belgian frites place- I could relive my time wandering around eating delicious frites! Mad City Frites, however, did not live up to my expectations. The frites weren't terrible, just nothing special. I went with a group of friends, so we were able to try each others' sauce choices, and these were also good, but nothing exceptional. 
I do like the handy holes in the tables for the cones of frites. They also have a pile of board games, which is a fun idea. 
I really wanted to love this place, but it fell a little short of my expectations."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"Mad City Frites takes fries to a whole new level.  I went with a friend and got a Large sized frites with the number 1 and number 2 sauces, and it was SUPER filling (granted, we went AFTER we ate dinner haha).  I love that their sauces have so much flavor, and that their fries aren't just ""crisps"".  I'm a huge fan of huge potatoey fries so I absolutely loved Mad City's fries.  All their sauces are really good so you really can't go wrong.  Their Mango sauce is slightly sweet, and while mango and fries don't sound like they go together, they actually do.  The garlic is very garlicy and not too salty, and again tastes great.  One tip though, if you get a large, BRING A FRIEND TO EAT IT WITH.  It is definitely a lot of fries.  My only caveat with this place is that two sauces isn't enough for 1 large sized fries (especially if you really like sauces)."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,Cool concept. The fries and the sauces are delicious--my friends and I got a bunch of different ones... the garlic/rosemary and the madcity sauce were my favs. But be forewarned... this is literally just fries and sauces to dip them in. Nothing fancy.
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"You say ""fried potatoes"" and I'm interested! While I've not been to Belgium, I do consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fries, frites, and chips, and I've got to say these are different from any I've had here in town.

Thick-cut, almost meaty, skin on frites tossed in seasoned salt, served hot and fresh. Could it get better? Add some ""game day garlic"" sauce or malt vinegar, and yes, it can. I loved the garlic sauce-- thick and flavorful. Also tried the beer cheese dip made with PBR, served warm, which was good. You could really taste the beer!

My friend and I thought picking up an order of frites would be a good side to our lunch, but really they could be a meal in themselves.

The atmosphere is nice and clean. The tables have holes for you to set your paper frite cone in, which is awesome. And they're working on implementing an automated ordering system which is pretty cool.

We met the owner (and her mom) and they were both so very nice! I am excited to go back soon!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"I had not previously had frites before my trip to Mad City, so I can't speak on authenticity or compare them to others around town. I can say that they were tasty and crazy filling. Having never been before and making the awesome, adult life choice to eat fries for dinner, my boyfriend and I each ordered a large frites. A small order comes with one sauce, and a large comes with two - as a sauce lover, I figured I might as well just go for the large since it was the same cost as a small with an extra sauce. I did not need a large. My boyfriend and I could have easily split one. Having four sauces, though, was awesome. I regret nothing. 

Mad Sauce - their signature, I couldn't put my finger on the exact flavor but I'm guessing it was ketchup, mayo, and maybe something else. 
Game Day Garlic - I want all the garlic, and sadly this mostly just tasted like a sweet mayo. 
Bascom Hill BBQ - tasty, thick barbecue sauce. 
Isthmus Honey Mustard - one of the best honey mustards I've had. A really good balance. Probably my favorite of the four, which surprised me. 

The frites themselves were extra thick and extra crispy. The insides were creamy and piping hot. Like, insanely hot. Due to the thick crust they stayed hot for the duration. It's a double-edged sword - nobody likes cold fries, but it's also nice to not burn your mouth. Snapping the frites in half helped let the steam escape and come down to an acceptable temperature. 

Looking forward to trying a few more of their sauces!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,Such a great place! The fries are amazing and the staff is very friendly. The inside of the restaurant is super cute and soon they will have self ordering iPad stations. I loved the sriracha lime sauce the best! These were the best fries I have had in a long time.
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"Every time we go here we load up on sauces. If you have a friend, split a large frite, and double down on the sauces. Grateful Red pepper aioli is the best. It's my favorite. We also get Game day Garlic, Mad Sauce, and a few from Sauce of the week (can't remember off hand though) If I'm going to get take out, I usually like to get a whole meal, but when I'm craving fries, I'm going to Mad City frites. They're also on the Hooked App so you're also able to get a deal if they post it. Nothing like good food with a discount."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"Oooooh yes, this is one of the good ones. IMO, the State Street area has always been kind of lacking in non-food cart, non-sit down/dine in snack places. There are some, and it's expanding, but not much else as you move toward the Square.

Enter Mad City Frites. As others have said, they only do one thing - but they do it well. If you're looking for hot, perfectly textured fries with delicious dipping sauce or some good poutine, get here. Plus, cool design stuff: the tables have little holes in them for the fry cones!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"They are located right in the middle of State St. They are open late. They serve thick hand cut fries and poutine. Need I say more?

A small order of the fries comes with choice of one sauce while the large version comes with two. Of course you can always ask for additional sauce for an extra charge. For me the small is perfect, sometimes it might even be too much, depending on how hungry I am.

My favorite sauce is the madtown mango, mango chutney aioli with garlic and lemon. There's a reason why this sauce is the first one on their list, number 1. Poutine is also great, made with Wisconsin cheddar and gravy *yum yum*

For those looking to spend the afternoon or a couple hours with friends munching on fries, there are plenty of games in store to keep you occupied."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,Great Friday night spot for me and my three year old daughter :-)  Mango sauce was delicious and frites had just the right amount of seasoning.  Very friendly service.  Lots of tables since they didn't have beer and wine available which is a must on State Street but in the mean time good time to try it before the outdoor seating gets sparse.
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"Delicious.
Perfect.
I will get them every time I walk downtown Madison.
I had the Mad City sauce!
Best fries in Madison. And I know fries."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"FRITES ON POINT. 

GENERAL: Great flavor, check the specials card for even more sauce variety, order 'em how you like 'em (extra crispy for me), check apps for frequent coupons/deals/steals!

I love love LOVE fried potatoes of any kind. These ones are delicious. Once you order, your frites are made fresh, which is always an added bonus.

FLAVOR: the seasoning is BOMB--a great combination of salty, tangy, smoky, garlicky, and every other delicious flavor you can imagine. There are maybe 10-15 sauces that you can choose from, and while I've enjoyed every one that I've had, the biggest standout for me is the sconnie sriracha. PRO TIP: don't get 100% set on your sauce decision based on the menu board; there are monthly specials on cards located up at the register. My favorite sauce so far has been the Roasted Red Pepper Aioli, which was a special sauce for this month. 

TEXTURE: texture hasn't always been totally consistent for me here--sometimes I get a crisper order, sometimes I get a softer one, but every time, there are a handful of really crisp little guys that are my favorite. Don't be afraid to tell them what you like! I've learned that they key is to order them extra crispy or ""well-done"" so that I get all of my frites just the way that I like em! 

PRICING: They definitely need to change this up--how? I'm not sure, but it doesn't make THAT much sense the way they have it now. They're not overpriced by any means, but it is a bit strange. The regular size is priced at $4.50, and it comes with one sauce. Large is $5.50 and comes with two sauces. Additional sauces can be purchased for $1.00 a piece or $2.50 for a combo of three sauces. If you're a sauce lover like me, you'll need an extra sauce no matter which size you go with...and while I'm not a fan of wasting food, at times it seems like it might be most cost-effective to just upgrade to the large for the extra ""free"" sauce and then get rid of whatever frites I don't eat. There are generally coupons on apps like Hooked that will get you a discount of some sort though, so that comes in handy for me a lot.

STAFF: The staff here is phenomenal. They are happy to answer questions and they're always polite, upbeat, and happy. I've seen them when I'm sober and I've seen them while I'm on the verge of blacking out, and they've always been kind and helpful. 

ATMOSPHERE: Urban chic, with specialty tables that have holes to insert your fry-cones into! It's a great place to stop in off of state street. You can hang out with friends and play a board game from their selection, sit by the window and people-watch, or just chill out and enjoy your frites!

5 stars! I hope this place sticks around for a long time!!!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"When it comes to frites, this is pretty fantastic.  My husband and I stopped here after doing some Christmas shopping on State St.  It was pretty empty when we got there around 1:15 PM.  We ordered a large frites with the #4 (queso) and #9 sauces.  Our frites came out piping hot pretty quickly.  I thought they were cooked well, seasoned well and the sauces were excellent.  There was just enough of the sauce to finish out the frites.  The portion size was great and the price was proportionate to the amount of frites we got.  Filled us up so much, we decided that was lunch!
I'd definitely come here again to try out more of the sauces."
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"If you are only going to do one thing in your restaurant, you better do it right.  In the case of Mad City Frites, I was expecting more and got less. 
I thought the fries themselves were perfectly cooked-crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside.  Complaint #1-Why put seasoning salt on the fries?  They change the flavor and clashes with the sauces.  Simple salt works just fine.  Complaint #2-The sauces didn't hit the mark.  With a small order, you get a choice on one sauce.  With a large, you get 2.  So, of course, we opted for the large.
With the choice of 10 sauces, we opted for the Game Day Garlic and Sconnie Sriracha.  The game day garlic was light on the garlic and heavy on the lemon.  The sriracha sauce was spicy but didn't real bring anything else to the table.  I was also surprised they didn't just offer a simple aioli.  Remember guys, sometimes less is more.
I was pleased to see they will be bringing wine and beer to the menu as I think this will be received well.
Sober, I probably won't be back.  After few beers and without any other options available, well then, all bets are off!"
Mad City Frites,7. sconnie sriracha sauce,"My wife and I each ordered a regular size with an extra dipping sauce. This turned out to be more food then I thought, almost enough for a full meal.

The fries were seasoned very well with seasoned salt and came out in just a few minutes. Most of the fries were well cooked but there was an undercooked one or two in my cone. I had the mango and the teriyaki sauces. Both of the sauces were thick white sauces. They both tasted good, but they didn't taste like mango or teriyaki. My wife and I couldn't even agree which was which. The sauces were labeled on top and the one label appeared smudged. I'm curious if we possible got one wrong sauce.  The two sauces my wife got were better, but I don't remember what they were.

The decor was simple, but nice. The tables with the custom holes for your fries are fun and I always enjoy window seating on State, which there is plenty of. 

It's worth the trip and something refreshingly new to town."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"I love this place. Seems family run since I always have the same waitress and see the same guy in the kitchen and the same lady doing office type things. I love their salsa it's different and I'm not sure what it is but I love it. They also bring a red bottle of spicy sauce with your meal and that stuff is good! I like to ask for the red bottle right away and mix it with the salsa to add some heat! Their queso dip is decent and I love the flautas, burritos, chimichangas, nachos, omg I haven't had anything here I don't like! Oh and I always get at least one margarita with my meal! Love this place!"
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"TacoQuest 2013 hits a rough patch

Needing to grab a quick bite to eat before heading out of town for my daughter's basketball game, I dropped by El Pastor for some carry out nourishment.  

I ordered a trio of tacos: the pastor, the lengua and the aguacate.

The verdict:  Exceedingly average.  While better than the slop served by Taco Bell, it is well below the quality of the tacos I have recently enjoyed at America Latina or Los Gemelos.

The $1.99 aguacate taco was a big tube of goo and impossible to eat on the go.  It was a puree of avocado and refried beans topped with lettuce, tomato and onions.  Any attempt to pick it up would result in the unsupported end dumping the contents on my lap. Even with a healthy dose of salsa, this dish was bland and uninspired.

The $1.99 lengua taco has had numerous flaws.  Unlike the aguacate taco, there was a great deal of textural contrast, but not in a good way. While most of the meat was tender and well seasoned, every other bite yielded a morsel that had the texture of well-chewed bubble gum, not what I wanted to encounter on my virgin foray with beef tongue.  To make matters worse, the roughly diced onions that topped this taco had an extremely sulfuric taste that overpowered the rest of the dish.  The last problem I had with this taco was how it was packaged for my carryout order.  It was double wrapped in paper and foil, so the corn tortillas were well steamed when I opened up the packaging and they disintegrated when I tried to pick it up.  The one positive was that generous amount of meat filling.   

The $1.99 pastor taco was the best prepared of the three tacos, but that was the only thing going for it.  The pork filling was generous in quantity and but again under seasoned.  I did not detect any of the pineapple that usually provides an accent to this dish. The salsa I received with my order did not help things out much.   It was similar to the bottled salsa I find at the local Piggly Wiggly (and that is not a good attribute for a Mexican restaurant).  

Since this was a carry out order, I cannot comment about the service, other than the hostess was courteous and my food was ready to go within five minutes of ordering it."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"For those of you who complain Madison is bereft of Mexican food, I instruct you to check out El Pastor.  It's amazing authentic food where you will probably have to know at least minimal Spanish in order to interact with your server. Get away from downtown, and go here."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"This was our first attempt at finding a good mexican restaurant in Madison.  The chips and salsa weren't great.  The salsa didnt seem very fresh but had a good kick.  I had the enchilada plate (one chees, two chicken with red and mole sauce.  My wife had the torta.  We also had a taco pastor, chile relleno and cheese quesadilla.
The enchiladas were horrible.  really nothing else to add about that.  the rice and beans were pretty good though.  Torta was excellent.  the taco was a little on the dry side and the relleno had very little spice.  cheese quesadilla was good, but it is pretty tough to screw that up.  The nite we were there they had $1.25 draft beer.  that was nice!!
In the end, I will definitely be trying other Mexican restaurants before going back."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"We eat here ALL the time. The food is always great--authentic Mexican--definitely not TexMex. Staff is always super friendly and the guacamole is delicious, as are the tacos!

They serve breakfast too!"
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"Solid cheap Mexican food. Yummy margaritas. The chicken and pork is better than the beef. Beef quality is actually not great.

I suggest the fajitas and burritos. You'll have leftovers."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"Whenever I try out a new Mexican restaurant, I always get a Chile Relleno because this reflects most accurately to me the quality of the kitchen.  Too many places just put some fake cheese on a bell pepper and hope you don't notice. 

Let me say it was a solid chile relleno. Great melty queso oaxaca, the poblanos had just a touch of heat, and the eggs were stiff enough to hold up even though I got it to go! Good stuff and freshly made.

The easy part is what they messed up though!
I got an al pastor burrito and was very disappointed.  Al pastor should be nice and crispy, like it just came off the trompo. This meat though, was likely sitting in a serving bin under a heat lamp for hours.  Too bad after such a promising start."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"This is our ""go-to"" place for Mexican. Best taste and by far most authentic around. If you don't like real Mexican food feel free to stop at the taco bell next door."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"I am constantly on the search for great Mexican in the Madison area and I was needless to say based off my 1 star, a little let down. 
Nothing special that I could put my finger on with this hole in the wall.

I ordered my usual, hoping for a great steak taco topped with some true Mexican cheese, and I was given something nothing close to what I wanted. 
El Pastor, you are claiming to be authentic Mexican right? Why are you not using authentic Mexican cheese and spices? Unacceptable.
Not to mention, the steak sucked. Not flavored at all. Straight up tasted like it had been cooked hours before serving. What are you trying to pull here? There were like 3 other people seated and it was 2pm on a Saturday. Take the time and grill me up some fresh steak. Not cool. 

I don't even know if I should start with the mess of beans and horrible rice thrown on my plate. Seriously, take some time and make it look nice. But I guess if it ends up tasting like it did (horrible), it might as well look the part too.

Overpriced ""want to be Mexican food"" is what I call this. 

I was told by a work friend that this place was pure Mexican food heaven, and now I have to look this person in the face and say, ""Your taste in Mexican food sucks"". 
Thanks El Pastor, you have made a soon to be awkward moment for me!"
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,I've felt like a fish out of water for the past year after having moved to Madison from Southern California...true Mexican food was nowhere to be found. But today we found El Pastor and felt like we were home again! Forget Tacos Guadalajara and keep driving south for the best Mexican in Madison. Their torta de bistec put a huge smile on my face. Affordable with friendly service. We'll be back!
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"I've eating here a few times with mixed results - anywhere from ""meh"" to ""excellent"".  

My last visit here brought a lunch burrito to my table.  I went with the steak because it sounded good and I was feeling beefy.  No ground beef option, so steak was it.  I'd say it was just ""okay"".  Not a great flavor like I'm used to from El Pastor.  I expected it to pop more, but it was pretty bland.  My lunchmate had a quesadilla and she didn't finish it, so I'm assuming it wasn't great either.  

Past visits provided me with better food - more of the authentic Mexican food that I was expecting this time around.

I'll eat here again, but I won't be as excited as I was before this last visit."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"HUITLACOHE!!! HUITLACOCHE!! THEY HAVE HUITLACOHE and it's delicioso.  Otherwise known as corn-fungus, this is a delicacy I have only learned about in my foodways courses and read about in the pretentious Gourmet magazine.  It's damn delicious in quesadilla form.  Subtle mushroom-like base w/ a slight touch of acidity and an even slighter touch of garlic.
 
Their melt-tender lamb barbacoa was rich and satisfying.  The orange cake my friend ordered was much the same -- it had fresh rind and icing layers so thick and fluffy. that I had to do everything in my power not to stick my fingers into it."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,Amazeballs!!!! I stopped in after driving by and thinking Mexican sounded good. Boy oh boy am I ever glad I did!!!
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"I have been to El Pastor plenty of times but haven't had the chance to review it. The fact that I have been back many times should be a tell-tale sign that I enjoy their food, but let me explain why I am a fan.

I am Mexican-American (Chicana) and I got some delicious, authentic Mexican fare made by my wonderful mom while growing up, so if I go to a Mexican restaurant a second time, it has to be good.

El Pastor is honestly one of the only Mexican restaurants I go to in Madison when I am craving some yummy tacos or some mole.

My personal favorite are their tacos de lengua (cow tongue for my adventurous eaters). Sprinkled with onions and cilantro, they are simple perfection. I also enjoy their chicken flautas, gorditas, and anything covered with their mole. Don't forget to wash everything down with their sweet horchata (flavored rice milk)!

Of course nothing will compare to mom's home cooking, so I can't give them a 5 star, but man am I hungry after writing this. Yum!"
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"El Pastor has consistently good food. Comfort food for me. I've had their tacos, quesadilla, salad, beans, rice, enchiladas, torta and many other items on their menu. Chicken or beef is my favorite. Mix and match for a custom plate. They have 5-10 lunch time specials too. Try the horchata. It is delicious. I keep saying that I want to try their flan, but usually I'm stuffed after the chips and salsa (3 kinds available) and then the meal. I should stop in one day for the flan and a horchata."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"I live close to La Mestiza on Madison's west side, but I'd rather go to El Pastor. It's quieter, the staff is friendlier, and the food is great.

I've had several things off the menu (all good) but my favorite, by far, is the whole fried tilapia. It is exactly as billed - a whole fish, lightly floured and fried to perfection. It's fiddly food, to be sure - you're picking around a carcass. But it is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort. The fish comes with your choice of rice and beans, or salad and fries. Both options come with tortillas on the side, so you can make your own fish tacos, if you like. 

The margaritas are great - and are 2-for-1 on Wednesday evenings. They also have a variety of Mexican soft drinks (including Mexican Coca-Cola, made with sugar). And beer, of course.

My dining companion and I have been here so often, in fact, that we have a code for when one of us wants to go to El Pastor. We just say, ""Let's go eat a fish."" We always leave sated and happy."
El Pastor,spicy mexican sausage quesadilla,"Been here a couple of times to eat some tacos, menudo, and tamales. I think the tacos here beats Taqueria Gaudalajara. Yeah, I said it! TG isn't horrible, but I preferred the tacos at this place, especially the pastor. 

Service is always pleasant. We first came here and met Lino (the owner/manager/ruler of the taco kingdom) when we made an appointment for a tasting for our upcoming wedding. After we had the food, we obviously chose them as our caterer. We haven't had our wedding yet, but Lino has been extraordinary in providing his time and services to this sometimes-neurotic bride.

In the restaurant, staff is always attentive but not bothersome. They always seem to know just when you need them, popping up right beside your table to help with whatever. 

The food is great! Being from CA and used to being surrounded by Mexican anything, this place sometimes reminds me of being there. Like I said before, their pastor tacos are great, as well as the barbacoa (lamb...and i hate lamb! Go figure) and steak. My fiancé likes the Tacuba Platter, which he says is tasty and filling. 

Great food, services, environment, and prices!"
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"The mole enchiladas were pretty good, I'd go back for those. I also liked their salsa - was different. The pastor taco was just okay.

It's a clean restaurant and isn't in a bad part of town. $2.50 beers is a plus. Overall, just okay."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"I love tacos. Plain and simple. And that is how I like my tacos too; plain and simple; your taco meat (or vegetables for you non-animal eating people) with onions and cilantro. El Pastor gives it to you just like that. The tacos I ate yesterday were a 4-5. That is the truth. I was hungry and I wanted tacos. They themselves were brilliant. However, if I am going to rate the entire overall experience I am giving my experience from yesterday a 3/5. Maybe it was because I was crabby from being up until 4 am, but I felt like I was waiting for an eternity for my food to arrive. When I arrived to El Pastor we were seated but it took a while for our waitress to come greet us, and I actually believe it was the host that eventually came back to take our drink order and not even our waitress. For 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were people in there but not enough people in there for me to have to wait as long as I did. 

I do believe my linner? Lunner? (lunch and dinner?) was the same as the man-friends. I think we both had the pork, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Bless those tacos. I would bill the chicken tacos as my least favorite of the three yesterday with the chorizo being the stand-out star. It was spiced beautifully and served at a perfect temperature. It was slightly more charred than what I would have liked, but hey, it was still pretty darn good. 

Will I be back?

Duh.

But will it be anytime soon? Probably not, as I am hearing of this new taco hot-spot on the east side that I believe needs to be checked out soon."

Let me say it was a solid chile relleno. Great melty queso oaxaca, the poblanos had just a touch of heat, and the eggs were stiff enough to hold up even though I got it to go! Good stuff and freshly made.

The easy part is what they messed up though!
I got an al pastor burrito and was very disappointed.  Al pastor should be nice and crispy, like it just came off the trompo. This meat though, was likely sitting in a serving bin under a heat lamp for hours.  Too bad after such a promising start."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"This is our ""go-to"" place for Mexican. Best taste and by far most authentic around. If you don't like real Mexican food feel free to stop at the taco bell next door."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"I am constantly on the search for great Mexican in the Madison area and I was needless to say based off my 1 star, a little let down. 
Nothing special that I could put my finger on with this hole in the wall.

I ordered my usual, hoping for a great steak taco topped with some true Mexican cheese, and I was given something nothing close to what I wanted. 
El Pastor, you are claiming to be authentic Mexican right? Why are you not using authentic Mexican cheese and spices? Unacceptable.
Not to mention, the steak sucked. Not flavored at all. Straight up tasted like it had been cooked hours before serving. What are you trying to pull here? There were like 3 other people seated and it was 2pm on a Saturday. Take the time and grill me up some fresh steak. Not cool. 

I don't even know if I should start with the mess of beans and horrible rice thrown on my plate. Seriously, take some time and make it look nice. But I guess if it ends up tasting like it did (horrible), it might as well look the part too.

Overpriced ""want to be Mexican food"" is what I call this. 

I was told by a work friend that this place was pure Mexican food heaven, and now I have to look this person in the face and say, ""Your taste in Mexican food sucks"". 
Thanks El Pastor, you have made a soon to be awkward moment for me!"
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,I've felt like a fish out of water for the past year after having moved to Madison from Southern California...true Mexican food was nowhere to be found. But today we found El Pastor and felt like we were home again! Forget Tacos Guadalajara and keep driving south for the best Mexican in Madison. Their torta de bistec put a huge smile on my face. Affordable with friendly service. We'll be back!
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"I've eating here a few times with mixed results - anywhere from ""meh"" to ""excellent"".  

My last visit here brought a lunch burrito to my table.  I went with the steak because it sounded good and I was feeling beefy.  No ground beef option, so steak was it.  I'd say it was just ""okay"".  Not a great flavor like I'm used to from El Pastor.  I expected it to pop more, but it was pretty bland.  My lunchmate had a quesadilla and she didn't finish it, so I'm assuming it wasn't great either.  

Past visits provided me with better food - more of the authentic Mexican food that I was expecting this time around.

I'll eat here again, but I won't be as excited as I was before this last visit."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,Amazeballs!!!! I stopped in after driving by and thinking Mexican sounded good. Boy oh boy am I ever glad I did!!!
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"I have been to El Pastor plenty of times but haven't had the chance to review it. The fact that I have been back many times should be a tell-tale sign that I enjoy their food, but let me explain why I am a fan.

I am Mexican-American (Chicana) and I got some delicious, authentic Mexican fare made by my wonderful mom while growing up, so if I go to a Mexican restaurant a second time, it has to be good.

El Pastor is honestly one of the only Mexican restaurants I go to in Madison when I am craving some yummy tacos or some mole.

My personal favorite are their tacos de lengua (cow tongue for my adventurous eaters). Sprinkled with onions and cilantro, they are simple perfection. I also enjoy their chicken flautas, gorditas, and anything covered with their mole. Don't forget to wash everything down with their sweet horchata (flavored rice milk)!

Of course nothing will compare to mom's home cooking, so I can't give them a 5 star, but man am I hungry after writing this. Yum!"
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"My favorite Mexican restaurant in town. I think Taqueria Guadalajara has better food in general, but I prefer El Pastor. The tacos are just as good and it is easier to get to and always easy to get a seat; and the tacos are fantastic! The staff is very welcoming, making it easy to come back regularly.

If you order one of the meals, get an extra taco a la carte. They are too good to come in here and not have at least one."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"Boring.  This place was recommended to me by several people.  And I want to stop talking to them now.  It was a complete let down.  

First, of all, the prices?  What?! Three tacos, rice and beans $9?  No thank you.

Second, the tacos were $1.50 extra if you wanted cheese.  Then it was mozzarella cheese?  Gross.  If I wanted mozzarella, I would eat Italian.  

Third, the food was ok.  Nothing special.  Nothing amazing.  The salsa they put on the table was sweet and hot.  No one wants to eat that.  I had chorizo tacos and they were just ok...just ok.  

This is what Mexican food is for people who know nothing about a good taco.  Harsh?  I know.  But the truth is the truth.  And my tacos were terrible.  I have used ""ok"" probably about twenty times during this review.  It got two stars because the service was friendly."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"I live close to La Mestiza on Madison's west side, but I'd rather go to El Pastor. It's quieter, the staff is friendlier, and the food is great.

I've had several things off the menu (all good) but my favorite, by far, is the whole fried tilapia. It is exactly as billed - a whole fish, lightly floured and fried to perfection. It's fiddly food, to be sure - you're picking around a carcass. But it is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort. The fish comes with your choice of rice and beans, or salad and fries. Both options come with tortillas on the side, so you can make your own fish tacos, if you like. 

The margaritas are great - and are 2-for-1 on Wednesday evenings. They also have a variety of Mexican soft drinks (including Mexican Coca-Cola, made with sugar). And beer, of course.

My dining companion and I have been here so often, in fact, that we have a code for when one of us wants to go to El Pastor. We just say, ""Let's go eat a fish."" We always leave sated and happy."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"Been here a couple of times to eat some tacos, menudo, and tamales. I think the tacos here beats Taqueria Gaudalajara. Yeah, I said it! TG isn't horrible, but I preferred the tacos at this place, especially the pastor. 

Service is always pleasant. We first came here and met Lino (the owner/manager/ruler of the taco kingdom) when we made an appointment for a tasting for our upcoming wedding. After we had the food, we obviously chose them as our caterer. We haven't had our wedding yet, but Lino has been extraordinary in providing his time and services to this sometimes-neurotic bride.

In the restaurant, staff is always attentive but not bothersome. They always seem to know just when you need them, popping up right beside your table to help with whatever. 

The food is great! Being from CA and used to being surrounded by Mexican anything, this place sometimes reminds me of being there. Like I said before, their pastor tacos are great, as well as the barbacoa (lamb...and i hate lamb! Go figure) and steak. My fiancé likes the Tacuba Platter, which he says is tasty and filling. 

Great food, services, environment, and prices!"
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,Some of the best tacos in town.  No frill restaurant that serves up great food at great prices.  Love their pastor taco as well as their chorizo tacos.  Very clean but sparse restaurant
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco combo,"Tamales are excellent!  Staff is friendly and the place is pleasant.  I had the taco dinner with an extra tamale to go.  The rice and beans are authentic and I really did like the tacos very much.  The only complaint I had was their hot sauce really wasn't hot enough for my taste but all in all, I will be back."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco,"The mole enchiladas were pretty good, I'd go back for those. I also liked their salsa - was different. The pastor taco was just okay.

It's a clean restaurant and isn't in a bad part of town. $2.50 beers is a plus. Overall, just okay."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco,"I love tacos. Plain and simple. And that is how I like my tacos too; plain and simple; your taco meat (or vegetables for you non-animal eating people) with onions and cilantro. El Pastor gives it to you just like that. The tacos I ate yesterday were a 4-5. That is the truth. I was hungry and I wanted tacos. They themselves were brilliant. However, if I am going to rate the entire overall experience I am giving my experience from yesterday a 3/5. Maybe it was because I was crabby from being up until 4 am, but I felt like I was waiting for an eternity for my food to arrive. When I arrived to El Pastor we were seated but it took a while for our waitress to come greet us, and I actually believe it was the host that eventually came back to take our drink order and not even our waitress. For 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were people in there but not enough people in there for me to have to wait as long as I did. 

I do believe my linner? Lunner? (lunch and dinner?) was the same as the man-friends. I think we both had the pork, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Bless those tacos. I would bill the chicken tacos as my least favorite of the three yesterday with the chorizo being the stand-out star. It was spiced beautifully and served at a perfect temperature. It was slightly more charred than what I would have liked, but hey, it was still pretty darn good. 

Will I be back?

Duh.

But will it be anytime soon? Probably not, as I am hearing of this new taco hot-spot on the east side that I believe needs to be checked out soon."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco,"TacoQuest 2013 hits a rough patch

Needing to grab a quick bite to eat before heading out of town for my daughter's basketball game, I dropped by El Pastor for some carry out nourishment.  

I ordered a trio of tacos: the pastor, the lengua and the aguacate.

The verdict:  Exceedingly average.  While better than the slop served by Taco Bell, it is well below the quality of the tacos I have recently enjoyed at America Latina or Los Gemelos.

The $1.99 aguacate taco was a big tube of goo and impossible to eat on the go.  It was a puree of avocado and refried beans topped with lettuce, tomato and onions.  Any attempt to pick it up would result in the unsupported end dumping the contents on my lap. Even with a healthy dose of salsa, this dish was bland and uninspired.

The $1.99 lengua taco has had numerous flaws.  Unlike the aguacate taco, there was a great deal of textural contrast, but not in a good way. While most of the meat was tender and well seasoned, every other bite yielded a morsel that had the texture of well-chewed bubble gum, not what I wanted to encounter on my virgin foray with beef tongue.  To make matters worse, the roughly diced onions that topped this taco had an extremely sulfuric taste that overpowered the rest of the dish.  The last problem I had with this taco was how it was packaged for my carryout order.  It was double wrapped in paper and foil, so the corn tortillas were well steamed when I opened up the packaging and they disintegrated when I tried to pick it up.  The one positive was that generous amount of meat filling.   

The $1.99 pastor taco was the best prepared of the three tacos, but that was the only thing going for it.  The pork filling was generous in quantity and but again under seasoned.  I did not detect any of the pineapple that usually provides an accent to this dish. The salsa I received with my order did not help things out much.   It was similar to the bottled salsa I find at the local Piggly Wiggly (and that is not a good attribute for a Mexican restaurant).  

Since this was a carry out order, I cannot comment about the service, other than the hostess was courteous and my food was ready to go within five minutes of ordering it."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco,"For those of you who complain Madison is bereft of Mexican food, I instruct you to check out El Pastor.  It's amazing authentic food where you will probably have to know at least minimal Spanish in order to interact with your server. Get away from downtown, and go here."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco,"This was our first attempt at finding a good mexican restaurant in Madison.  The chips and salsa weren't great.  The salsa didnt seem very fresh but had a good kick.  I had the enchilada plate (one chees, two chicken with red and mole sauce.  My wife had the torta.  We also had a taco pastor, chile relleno and cheese quesadilla.
The enchiladas were horrible.  really nothing else to add about that.  the rice and beans were pretty good though.  Torta was excellent.  the taco was a little on the dry side and the relleno had very little spice.  cheese quesadilla was good, but it is pretty tough to screw that up.  The nite we were there they had $1.25 draft beer.  that was nice!!
In the end, I will definitely be trying other Mexican restaurants before going back."
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco,"We eat here ALL the time. The food is always great--authentic Mexican--definitely not TexMex. Staff is always super friendly and the guacamole is delicious, as are the tacos!

They serve breakfast too!"
El Pastor,mexican sausage taco,"Solid cheap Mexican food. Yummy margaritas. The chicken and pork is better than the beef. Beef quality is actually not great.

Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I've been wanting to write this for awhile. I just want to say, WOW! This place was amazing. My husband and I went to dine there and had gift certificates that were about to expire. We had not had a chance to use them and they were expiring in one week. We had $100 worth! It went a loong way . The staff was extremely nice and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. Som-Tum, papaya salad was something I usually would not order and was a perfect compliment to the meal. Spring Roll and Chicken Satay were my two favorite appetizers. Very refreshing. My favorite curry was the Ka-Ree, but they were all good. The surprise of the day for us though was the Sticky Rice with Coconut Custard. Dessert is something I usually do not order either and it was soooo good. It really plays on the hot and cold temperatures and I cannot wait to order this again. (at $3.95, you have to) The food was great, but the staff is top notch and they even helped us spend the rest of our gift certificates, suggesting on numerous things to go.They really treated u slike royalty. I will definitely come back when I am in Madison again, Those of you who live there, I am jealous."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I am a big fan of S-BT's curry, especially the Ka-Ree. One day I ordered the Ka-Ree over the phone for take-out, not realizing that there's also a noodle version. When I realized my mistake my reaction was, ""Meh, I'll just try something new!"" Although the sauce and meat were flavorful, there was just something about those noodles that I couldn't deal with: they seemed kind of gloppy-mushy, and very nearly tripped my gag reflex when they went down. So it's back to the CURRY version of Ka-Ree for me, and I'm a happy camper!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,Jungle Curry was EXACTLY what I expected. Creamy hot red curry packed with veggies and tofu. Should have been a bit spicier to be considered truly authentic Thai. Yummy 'til the last bite.
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Beautiful place at a great location. Whenever we go out as a group, and not feeling in the mood for a bar / brewery, Sa Bai Thong is always our go-to spot.

The food is fantastic. Presentation is wonderful, taste is even better. Their Duck curry and Jungle curry absolutely outshines any that I've ever had. I also always have leftovers to enjoy later."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Lunch here is a great option (although not a fast option if you dine-in). The food is great and was brought out soon after ordering. The atmosphere is probably the best part as it's decorated well and feels very ""home-y"" overall. 4 stars because the service was a little slow in ending the meal (checking if we needed boxes, running the card, etc.) I'll be back again for lunch I'm sure."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,I agree with Alex S. I have had the similar problem. The waitress was not very friendly. I am from neighboring country of Thailand so I can handle spicy food like most natives can. I have been to Thailand once a few years back. I ordered papaya salad and a curry dish. I ordered the hottest of the hot dish and i ended with the sweet version of the papaya salad and curry was okay. I went in there to satisfy my pallets and all I got was a modified version. I felt total let down. I have not been there since.
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Good food and good size portions. One soup is enough for two. If you don't have a large appetite, you can probably share a curry or noodle dish too. Tasty food, and they can definitely make it spicy if you ask them too which is great. Ambience is great too, will be back soon!

Friendly service too!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I have been there twice for takeout. 
The dumplings were outstanding. Best I have ever had from a restaurant. The curry dishes we tried were heavenly, and most important they don't fake the heat. So if it says hot it is hot, and thats how I like it."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Ordered some tom yum and panang curry to go, food was great and actually spicy like I asked! It was also ready very quickly. I don't give them five stars because they use the tom yum paste in their soup rather than making it all from scratch, I'm a bit picky when it comes to that."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Missing on every level.

Service: Was seated by the kitchen where we were feeling a cold draft coming through on occasions. Left alone for long periods of time. Right at the beginning after being seated and throughout. With water glasses siting empty for far too long. But the waitress was nice thou. 

A HUGE pet peeve happened too. Hate, Hate, Hate it when they don't bring all the entrees out at the same time. There was at least 5 minutes between each time we got our entrees. I got mine first. So was about 15 + minute till the last one came out. Bad timing on kitchens part. Luckily mine were cold items. I personally don't like to start eating till everyone has their food. I find it rude.

Food: The Shrimp Purses were tiny and cute but nothing special. Tasted like bite size egg rolls. Papaya Salad was too sweet and vinegary with no hit of fish sauce or shrimp paste. Crying Tiger had tender beef stripes but no pizzaz.  Pad Thai was ok. Not to saucy but once again missing something. The curry special was the best thing of the night.  With huge tender chucks of chicken and a kicking good peanut curry sauce.

Heat Level: They hit right on target here. Where most place miss the mark for me. I wanted super hot and I got it. WIN. (cough, cough wheres my water!)

The food was forgettable,service was non existing and kitchen disorganized. Im going to say I will never be back to this location at least."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,I just love their pad Thai and pa neang curry. For appetizer try their tofu summer roll. I have been here multiple times and this place has never disappointed me. Sometimes I become adventurous and order them spicy but if you are not a spice loving person don't go there.
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I don't really understand the low star reviews, but I guess I've only dinned in once and every other time I've gotten take out. The one time I dinned in wasn't the best, but they were super busy so I wasn't sure how to feel. The take out has always been FANTASTIC. I've tried many of their curries and I've never really disliked any of them. I definitely think the place is over priced, but I crave this place too damn much and end up paying the prices. I always have left overs and end up needing extra rice. Usually I'll just make it at home myself when I'm heating up left overs the next day. The times I've gotten extra rice, it heated up pretty well when microwaved with the curry. I probably wouldn't dine in again, but I highly suggest take out."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I'm staying at the Marriott and a local at my class recommended this restaurant. I was so tired after working all day and it's so cold out that I couldn't stand the idea of going out.  Lucky, these guys deliver.  They delivered delicious  curry to me in just about an hour.  Delivery charge of $2.50 was so worth it and the meal was perfect!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Let me just say first, I have never been so dissapointed with a dining experience my whole life. My curry fried rice was absolutely burnt to a crisp and when I politely asked if this was the way it is supposed to be, my waitress said she was too busy to answer my question. Our drinks were never brought to us except for water which is surprising because there were only 5 other tables, so not very busy at all. My curry was so disgustingly oily I could'nt swallow it and the rice was so soggy from being so undercooked. I would encourage anyone and everyone to go to the other location on university avenue if you can, their stuff is divine and the managment and service there is superb compared to this shit. Sorry for the profanity, but I cannot stand for being treated so terribly. Never again."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"The squash curry, pa-naeng curry, and jungle curry are all outstanding. I get the tofu option, and I've had enough soggy tofu in my day to really appreciate how perfectly this tofu is cooked. I've never eaten in the restaurant, but my boyfriend and I carry-out regularly."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I had eaten lunch at Sa-Bai Thong a few years back and remembered it being pretty good, so while in the area running errands, my fiance and I decided to try it for dinner. While the atmosphere is clean and the decor is nice, I was very disappointed with the meal. I ordered the Pad Si Ew and my fiance ordered a yellow curry dish with tofu. While sitting at our table I could see into a small area going into the kitchen that had a microwave cart. I watched our waitress put a plate of food into the microwave which she then took out and brought right over to our table (which was my dish). She set my fiance's curry down also and quickly rushed away without checking if we needed anything else. The curry dish came missing the tofu. We waited for 10-15 minutes before the waitress came anywhere near our table (we had to flag her down) in order to tell her that there wasn't any tofu in the curry. At this time, we were pretty annoyed and also inquired as to why my dish would have been microwaved. She tried to reassure us that my dish was made fresh but that it was done before the yellow curry so she had to re-heat it... which is just poor planning. My food came dried out and the noodles were sticking together. I would have rather received our meals at different times than have my meal re-heated in the microwave. She did get my fiance a bowl of tofu for his dish but at this point, he was almost done eating. She gave us 10% off our bill for not including tofu in the dish but did not address the microwaved food.  I have had much better Thai food and service for much less money (even with the 10% off). This was a total waste of time and money and we will not be returning here."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in town! I've been searching for good thai food for sometime now, exploring my options from the wes side to Willy st and any in between, but I always return to this location for its consistency, flavor, and service.

I love the fact that their curry sauce is more thick like gravy than soupy. The portions are always generous and the pricing for lunch is perfect. My favorites is the red duck curry. 

Their space is nicely decorated by a variety of Thai souvenirs and the the noise level is quiet, great choice for professional lunches. I highly recommend."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Driving through Madison and stopped here. We had the Masaman curry and Tom Kha soup. The food was delicious, the decor was tasteful, and the service was spot-on. Also, although we didn't try it, I noticed they serve organic wine!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"When I first moved to Madison I was really excited to come to this restaurant because the man had hyped it up as a great Thai eatery.  When I finally visited the restaurant it definitely did not live up to the hype.

On the plus side the place is really nice and is a great place for dates and groups as it is very large.  However the food, as this is a restaurant, should also be great and unfortunately it was not.  I ordered a red curry dish which sounded great but was disappointed at first bite.  It's not that it was bad because it certainly wasn't but it just wasn't great.  There seemed to be something missing that I was not able to put my finger on.  The man ordered the pad Thai which he actually loved.  I didn't try any of it so I don't have anything to say about it.

As far as the presentation of the food however that was spot on.  I would recommend this place to anyone trying to venture out and try something different as the flavors are not in your face.  Also the staff was great and very attentive."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Food was OK last night.  Not as good as I remembered.  We've been coming for over 10 years.

Let's just focus on the bizarre service last night:
1. They forgot to bring water for a quite a while
2. The four of us (my wife and two girls, one of whom was not feeling that hungry) ordered 3 entrees (mus-a-mun, crispy duck, and tried a new dish).  The waitress (I think might be the owner, or else the worst waitress ever) was clearly unhappy and made comments like, ""O only 3 entrees?""
3. We asked for an additional bowl of rice, she said, ""O, you are not done eating?""
4. When the check came, she made a point of sending only 3 pieces of chocolate (Get it? You order 3 entrees, you get 3 chocolates!)
5. The girls were feeling tired, as they headed to the car, I waited for them to bring my credit card back.  The same waitress came and asked if I wanted to order cupcake and macaroons (Hello?  The table is empty, they're all gone.)  When I said, ""No thanks,"" she asked, ""Did you have enough to share with your girls?""

The waitress (owner?) was I believe extremely offended that we only ordered 3 entrees (with tip came out to over $50.00) for four people.  She couldn't stop making that point to us over and over again.  

It was funny yet awkward experience to be at the receiving end of so much passive-aggressive anger.  

But suffice it to say, while this restaurant used to be a favorite for special occasions (I came for my graduation, the girls' birthdays), that will no longer be the case."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I've been here a couple of times with friends and my wife. Every time, we've enjoyed our food and the service.

Our most recent experience was with a group of 6 people. Service feels like 'home' as my wife puts it. You're continually asked how you're doing and how the food is, but not in a way that is annoying. More like when your grandmother is making sure you're doing okay and eating well. So I agree with her when she says it's like home.

I usually get the curry fried rice with the ""careful"" or ""adventure"" spicy level. At times, there can be too much onion in the dish. Otherwise, it's very good. It's not too spicy that the flavor is gone. My wife has always enjoyed getting any noodle dish, so no complaints from her.

Probably one of our favorite spots here in Madison for Thai food."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"I've gone here twice with a group of friends after shopping at the mall.  Both times all of us were disappointed with the flavors of the food.  On my recommendation we got the panang curry (normally my favorite everywhere else I go) but it was bland and full of huge apple chunks. I've never seen that anywhere before,  it barely had any veggies.  No carrots or potatoes or anything. And the portion was tiny for the cost.  The tom yum soup was ok but pretty sour and not very coconuty. I've had better Thai in Madison so I won't be back."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Go here at least once a month for lunch. The food is delicious, only drawback is the service is slow. But the people are friendly and the food is the best Thai in Madison."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,I have been here several times. Best Thai restaurant in Madison area. Good food with affordable price. The crispy duck curry is my favorite and they have many delicious appetizer worth to try.
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Great first time here for dinner last night. 

Atmosphere was relaxing and quiet. It was only about 4 or 5 tables since it was an hour from closing when we arrived. Service was average.

We started with the Toong Thong for appetizer (Ground chicken, potato, carrot and onion wrapped with rice paper skin slightly deep fried to golden brown, served with house sauce). Bf's first time having Thai food and he enjoyed this. 

I had the Tom Yum soup, which is a little off from what I'm used to but it was overloaded with mushrooms and had a little spice to it. Officially one of my new favorite soups!

He had the curry fried rice with chicken. Didn't expect it to be as spicy as it was, but it was still VERY good. I had a few bites and even though it was a little too much onions, we'd definitely order it again.

It was a late dinner so I didn't get a chance to order a couple more things to introduce him to, but we'll definitely be back!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"They don't have the special lunch for pineapple fried rice anymore, and it sucks. but overall the foods are good, tasty and at okay price. the That iced tea is super good and I love the gradient color of it, must order drink here. I would say it's a good place for date or dinning place instead of Thai basil with good food but only for carry out or delivery."
Sa-Bai Thong West,45b. lunch roast duck curry,"Sa Bai's two locations, one (recently renovated) on the near West Side, one further West on Odana's restaurant strip, serve reliably satisfying and tasty  Thai food and are justifiably local favorites in a town that loves Thai food and supports quite a few of them for a city of its size. Atmosphere is quite attractive and comfortable in both locations. There is a large menu with many delights; at least until recently, the Odana (not Obama, not Osama) location had several  additional dishes, especially good at dinnertime. The chefs are cooperative with spicing requests, allowing for more assertive dishes than are available in most Madison Asian restaurants. Food usually tastes fresh and lively. Soups and noodle dishes are usually excellent. Service at the University Ave location is usually quite good; the Odana location is spottier, often with long waits at dinnertime. We've had good luck with delivery from the Odana location, although certain dishes (e.g., duck) are best when eaten fresh from the kitchen."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I've had better Thai food, but their Crying Tiger, Laab, and ""traditional"" dishes (fried rice, pad thai, etc.) are pretty good. Haven't found a better alternative in the West Madison area."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Some of the tastiest Thai I've had in awhile!

The squash curry was scrumptious, bursting with flavor. 3 stars heat level (one notch below the highest they offer) was plenty for me -- they don't mess around. Pad thai and fried rice also crazy delicious. Some items are pricey ($7 to $9 for soups??) and I would have liked more veggies (onions, peppers, etc.) along with my squash and tofu, but other than that it was great.

Very nice atmosphere for eating in. The take-out scene was nuts on a Friday night; we were quoted 20 min and it ended up taking 35. Annoying, but at least you know they're making it from scratch when it takes this long. Recommend calling ahead, although confusion seemed to reign at the front counter, with orders under the wrong name, wrong food, never received, oh wait actually it's right here -- so maybe better just to dine in. They also deliver, but there is a charge if you live beyond 3 miles."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I like this place and think it is one of the better Madison Thai restaurants, though I think the other location on University is better and more consistent. Had take out and only one dish was memorable. Still, it's my go to take out place when I am visiting the parents on the west side of town."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,Not exactly the most authentic Thai food I have had. Well this wasn't exactly Thai food. For what it was it tasted good service was OK. Had to flag down the waiter multiple times to get a refill of water.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Came with some WI pals, and this is their favorite Thai place.  Wait staff was friendly and very attentive, my shrimp pad Thai was very flavorful, and they let us stay sitting and chatting for almost an hour after our meal was completed.  I didn't have room for dessert - but the cupcakes looked fantastic!  Reasonably priced featured local wine as well."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,Jungle Curry was EXACTLY what I expected. Creamy hot red curry packed with veggies and tofu. Should have been a bit spicier to be considered truly authentic Thai. Yummy 'til the last bite.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I've been the take-out queen this week.  Tonight Dad wanted Thai, so here we are.  I pulled up the menu online and ordered Pad Thai, Pad Chu Chee and two Thai Iced Teas.  They told me when to show up and it was ready when I got there.  The tea was packed with ice in one cup and the tea/milk in another so we could pour it together when we were ready.  That was groovy. 
The Pad Thai was just ok.  I get major Pad Thai cravings and this just didn't quite do the trick.  It wasn't bad, I've just had better.  The Pad Chu Chee had a nice coconut milk flavor in the sauce.  It was good.
Overall, I'd go back.  Don't remember how much it cost - it was reasonable."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Lunch here is a great option (although not a fast option if you dine-in). The food is great and was brought out soon after ordering. The atmosphere is probably the best part as it's decorated well and feels very ""home-y"" overall. 4 stars because the service was a little slow in ending the meal (checking if we needed boxes, running the card, etc.) I'll be back again for lunch I'm sure."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I'm very hard to please and they nailed it. Great friendly service, very good peanut sauce with the chicken satay and proper beef panaeng just how I like it. The spice rating system is a little Americanized, I went with 3 out of 4 stars because when trying a new Thai place it can be dangerous to go full tilt the first time but if you can eat a jalepeno popper you can handle 4 star heat there. I've even heard that the university location does it better so I'll try them soon and report back."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Missing on every level.

Service: Was seated by the kitchen where we were feeling a cold draft coming through on occasions. Left alone for long periods of time. Right at the beginning after being seated and throughout. With water glasses siting empty for far too long. But the waitress was nice thou. 

A HUGE pet peeve happened too. Hate, Hate, Hate it when they don't bring all the entrees out at the same time. There was at least 5 minutes between each time we got our entrees. I got mine first. So was about 15 + minute till the last one came out. Bad timing on kitchens part. Luckily mine were cold items. I personally don't like to start eating till everyone has their food. I find it rude.

Food: The Shrimp Purses were tiny and cute but nothing special. Tasted like bite size egg rolls. Papaya Salad was too sweet and vinegary with no hit of fish sauce or shrimp paste. Crying Tiger had tender beef stripes but no pizzaz.  Pad Thai was ok. Not to saucy but once again missing something. The curry special was the best thing of the night.  With huge tender chucks of chicken and a kicking good peanut curry sauce.

Heat Level: They hit right on target here. Where most place miss the mark for me. I wanted super hot and I got it. WIN. (cough, cough wheres my water!)

The food was forgettable,service was non existing and kitchen disorganized. Im going to say I will never be back to this location at least."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,The food here is authentic and delicious. The thing I love most is that they use lime and fresh cilantro is many of their dishes. I would say this is the best Thai food I've ever had. Service was also pretty great both times I've been.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I've had Thai food in many different places and this was not good, unfortunately. Service good but food not recommended :/"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"We like authentic Thai food - found it here in Madison! Fantastic coconut soup, papaya salad, minced beef and I'm sure many other Thai plates...
We tried it so far twice and will surely come back!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I'm in a bad bad mood - (spoiler alert!) Jon & Kate are separating! I'll try not to take it out on Sai Bai Thong too much.

So I'm in town for Epic training at the Radisson and I figured I order some pickup right before J and K's ""special announcement"". I got back from my workout at about 7:40pm; I figured, ""Hey, I got 20 mins to spare and the place is just around the corner"". The only thing was, no one was picking up! I called about three times consecutively and still no answer. I called the other location in downtown Madison and they picked up instantly. The person on the phone just advised to call again. 

Already irritated that my precious time was dwindling, I gave them another ring and they finally answered. I put in my order, drove to the restaurant, waited another 20 mins and made it back at about 8:15. Fortunately, J&K hadn't made their announcement yet so I wasn't missing out.

Anyway, so here I was ready to plop down and enjoy the food and the show when I realized they didn't even pack me any silverware or napkins! Isn't that standard for takeout? I had to call the service desk to bring some to my room. Trifling!

Now to the food; the one thing I can say about this place is that it doesn't lack flavor. Whether that's a good thing; that is the question. I ordered Som Tum (Papaya Salad), Crying Tiger (Thai Beef Salad) and Chicken Satay. The Papaya Salad had a decent flavor which was pretty consistent throughout . The Chicken Satay was saved by the peanut sauce (probably one of the better peanut sauces I've tasted); otherwise it was average. Finally, the Thai Beef Salad was just off. When I opened the container, I had dig to find any greens. It looked like nothing but shredded strips of beef.  In that case, it should have come with tortillas. Secondly, my first bite felt like accidently taking a gulp of water from the Red Sea. Super salty!!! 

Overall, the food was ok and service was subpar - I need to find a new Thai spot to hit up whenever I'm in Madison."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,I just love their pad Thai and pa neang curry. For appetizer try their tofu summer roll. I have been here multiple times and this place has never disappointed me. Sometimes I become adventurous and order them spicy but if you are not a spice loving person don't go there.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Extensive menu with options galore. Wonderful ambiance. Pleasant staff and priced well. Side note: personally, I like my Thai ""hot"". I recommend the **** fire for those with a love for tabasco level heat.  Thank you Flora."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Food - delicious, typical Thai food. I thought they should have given 3 people at least a bowl of rice for each person, instead they served just 1 plate of rice to have us share amongst each other, which was definitely not enough. The spiciness rating system I thought could be worded better. I ordered a dish that was 2 stars, which is described as careful, wasn't very spicy at all

Price - decent, $13-$15 for an entree with tips included

Service - what are all these reviews talking about? Service was pretty good if not very good. Waitresses are always paying attention to our table, so many of these reviews don't do them justice. Maybe they changed up the staff quite a bit

Overall - I'd be coming back if I wanted to try out some more Thai dishes and would order something 3 or 4 stars on the spiciness scale"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,Anybody who has had real Thai food knows this is glorified Chinese food. Very disappointing. Way better options in Madison.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,What an absolute surprise. Was not expecting some of the best Thai I have ever had in a strip mall in Wisconsin. A great find and a destination to return to.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Compared to my regular thai food fix, in Chicago this place is good - not great.

The variety and flavor of the dishes is quite good but, the service is best described as random. Having to ask for chop sticks is just unacceptable.

As for the spice factor - adventure is not really spicy at all and should be noted in the ordering process. Also, beware the spring rolls."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,I'm surprised by the overall ratings of this place. It has held up as being my favorite Thai cuisine in Madison for many years. I'm a huge fan of the curries(have not tried much else) and the thai iced teas. It can be busy and service can be taxed-especially for takeout/delivery.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I had eaten lunch at Sa-Bai Thong a few years back and remembered it being pretty good, so while in the area running errands, my fiance and I decided to try it for dinner. While the atmosphere is clean and the decor is nice, I was very disappointed with the meal. I ordered the Pad Si Ew and my fiance ordered a yellow curry dish with tofu. While sitting at our table I could see into a small area going into the kitchen that had a microwave cart. I watched our waitress put a plate of food into the microwave which she then took out and brought right over to our table (which was my dish). She set my fiance's curry down also and quickly rushed away without checking if we needed anything else. The curry dish came missing the tofu. We waited for 10-15 minutes before the waitress came anywhere near our table (we had to flag her down) in order to tell her that there wasn't any tofu in the curry. At this time, we were pretty annoyed and also inquired as to why my dish would have been microwaved. She tried to reassure us that my dish was made fresh but that it was done before the yellow curry so she had to re-heat it... which is just poor planning. My food came dried out and the noodles were sticking together. I would have rather received our meals at different times than have my meal re-heated in the microwave. She did get my fiance a bowl of tofu for his dish but at this point, he was almost done eating. She gave us 10% off our bill for not including tofu in the dish but did not address the microwaved food.  I have had much better Thai food and service for much less money (even with the 10% off). This was a total waste of time and money and we will not be returning here."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I've come here a few times and tried a few different items, including curries, tom yum soup, and the pad kee mao. The food does not taste fresh, and is surprisingly bland for Thai food. Nothing was particularly good, and the service is slow. If you forget to ask your waiter for something, be prepared to wait a good 10 minutes until they come around next (even when the place is not at all busy). They don't bring everyone's food at once and aren't attentive enough to refill water often.

Pretty disappointing overall, I don't recommend it."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I going to preface this review by saying that, in general, I have lower expectations for service and decor at ethnic restaurants - that is why this got s 4 and not a 3.

Service/decor - I see alot of negative reviews on here citing bad service. I've been here on three occasions and each time the service has been white good. Granted, I was there weekend nights and not on a Tuesday afternoon. Decor is VERY nice compare to comparable restaurants in town.

Food - It always pleases me. I have found, and my Asian boyfriend has confirmed, that Sa-Bai is kind of a fusion between authentic Thai and what, apparently, a contingent of Madisonians want. I'm more than okay with this, as I have enjoyed every meal here.

Price - You pay for the nice decor and friendlier service. I'm willing to pay the extra 3/4 bucks an entree for that any night."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,Delicious!  We had the Tom Kha soup with shrimp (our favorite Thai dish).  We were pleasantly surprised to see lots of shrimp in the dish and cooked perfectly (not over cooked as they often are).  They were very accommodating when we requested a side dish of steamed veggies (not on the menu).  Highly recommend.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Wow...I love this place. Great Thai food..very reasonable prices. Beautiful ambiance. While waiting to be seated, there were several people coming in to pick up carry out orders. Service was very good. Highly recommended restaurant near West Towne Mall."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Food quality was below average. Adventure spicy is less than medium. I has Tom ka soup and beef pad Thai. Would not recommend. Also, employees were having a meeting on how to use the credit card machine and 2 were being reprimanded for incorrect usage. Not appropriate when customers in lobby."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Another failed attempt to find good Pad Thai in Madison. The summer rolls are good, but for the most part the food is bland. I eat thai food for the richness in flavors and the sauces here just don't cut it."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"My family and I really enjoy eating at Sa-Bai Thong - though we often forget the name of it!  We've only been to the Odana rd. location, but we have gone about 4 times now and find the food delicious, the wait staff usually attentive, and the atmosphere relaxed.

I especially like the Tom-kha gai soup (the base is a chicken broth with coconut milk), which is a great warm-up on cold Wisconsin days!  I enjoy the Pad-Thai, a tasty comfort food which reminds me of a noodle casserole.  My son enjoys the vegetarian curries, and my daughter usually gets the chicken in peanut sauce - yum.

I recommend the Sa-Bai Thong restaurant if you're in the area and craving Thai food!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Made my 2nd trip to Sa-Bai Thong. First trip was not great, but not bad. Ordered the Pad See U, which is my typical dish at Thai restaurants. It was mediocre. This time I got the Pad Thai. It was average as far as Pad Thai goes. Service was okay"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Ok, I checked in and we were seated about 5 minutes after entering the restaurant. We were given menus and then they didn't come back for 35 minutes. We ended up just leaving super hungry and a bit cranky. I think they were busier than they were expecting to be (due to the holiday and everyone not working on that day). What a huge bummer! I was so looking forward to their pad thai. I hear that it's delicious. Even though I'm super bummed, I will probably be back to try it out."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Friendly service, reasonable prices and the food had a great variety and creativity that thai restaurants often lack. The food is more american thai than authentic, but they still do a lot with that limitation. 
As a point, if you like your food spicey, you really have to request it, otherwise it will come back Madison-approved hotness free."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"It was a rainy night. I wanted pad thai take-out and Sa-Bai Thong is just a couple miles down the road. Not amazing, but it's pad thai, so what do you expect. I thought their version was solid. Thanks, Sa-Bai Thong!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Was skeptical about getting asian food in a small town but was not disappointed!  Food was delicious.   Service was slow intially but definitely got better.  You can pick how spicy you want your dishes.  One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a long time.  I wish this place was in San Jose!  We also needed separate checks because for business expense, and this is the only restaurant where they not only divided the checks up for us but they divided equally each dish we ordered, which was nice!  Definitely would recommend this place."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,They make the best Thai curries ever! My husband and I eat here often and feel that this is the best Thai place in Madison. They are very vegetarian friendly and can make any dish vegan. I have had Thai food at many places (husband loves Thai food) and we always feel like it's never as good as Sa Bai Thong. My favorite is the jungle curry!
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in town! I've been searching for good thai food for sometime now, exploring my options from the wes side to Willy st and any in between, but I always return to this location for its consistency, flavor, and service.

I love the fact that their curry sauce is more thick like gravy than soupy. The portions are always generous and the pricing for lunch is perfect. My favorites is the red duck curry. 

Their space is nicely decorated by a variety of Thai souvenirs and the the noise level is quiet, great choice for professional lunches. I highly recommend."

Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"This restaurant took me by surprise, I was craving Thai food and happened upon this place by a friend's referral.  The cuisine is great and the ambience is awesome.  I'd recommend this restaurant for those Thai food lovers in Madison."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,The décor is modern and classy.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I found it to be not very spicy so you may need to ask if you are used to very spicy thai.  The service as very prompt and friendly.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Ate here one time.
Pad Thai
Spring Rolls

The Pad Thai was the most unusual Pad Thai I've ever had, in that it really didn't taste like Pad Thai at all, was too dark looking (too much soy?) and was basically crap.

The spring rolls were a little better, but not better than the nearby Vietnamese place.
So I do not recommend this place at all.
If you want good Thai (for Madison) go to Thai Noodles on McKee.

Adios!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Here I go again, singing the praises of Chicago food.

As someone who was spoiled by having every type of food at her fingertips for eight glorious years, I really missed good Thai when I moved to Madison. I had a beef Pad Si Ew hankering from hell one day, so we ordered Sa-Bai Thong. 

Thai food should be cheap (under $10) and delicious. This was mediocre and more pricy. The sauce was thick, bland and jelly like, and there was barely any beef. 

I have given this place another shot, ordering Pad Thai the second time, and it was no better. What kind of a Thai place can't make decent Pad Thai?!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"If you need a Thai cuisine fix, this place will satisfy your cravings. I would say it's your average Americanized Thai restaurant with your standard pad thais (quite orange and sweet) and appetizer rolls. Nothing terribly special but still all right. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the noodle texture (springy, not mushy) but the sauce/flavor was a little standard.
For dishes that are meant to be spicy, you can get the spice level on a scale of ""tiny"" to ""adventure""."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I've been here a couple of times with friends and my wife. Every time, we've enjoyed our food and the service.

Our most recent experience was with a group of 6 people. Service feels like 'home' as my wife puts it. You're continually asked how you're doing and how the food is, but not in a way that is annoying. More like when your grandmother is making sure you're doing okay and eating well. So I agree with her when she says it's like home.

I usually get the curry fried rice with the ""careful"" or ""adventure"" spicy level. At times, there can be too much onion in the dish. Otherwise, it's very good. It's not too spicy that the flavor is gone. My wife has always enjoyed getting any noodle dish, so no complaints from her.

Probably one of our favorite spots here in Madison for Thai food."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I've gone here twice with a group of friends after shopping at the mall.  Both times all of us were disappointed with the flavors of the food.  On my recommendation we got the panang curry (normally my favorite everywhere else I go) but it was bland and full of huge apple chunks. I've never seen that anywhere before,  it barely had any veggies.  No carrots or potatoes or anything. And the portion was tiny for the cost.  The tom yum soup was ok but pretty sour and not very coconuty. I've had better Thai in Madison so I won't be back."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"There are better, and cheaper, places for Thai food in Madison but you still can't go too far wrong here. The service is kinda shit though. I don't know if the waitstaff have fully mastered the English language because they fuck up special requests on the reg. I don't give a shit but my friends with dietary issues do (my bud with lactose intolerance had some rancid gas after eating one of the curries with cream in it). I recommend the squash curry. Pad See Ew is should have an emphasis on the ""Eww,"" as it was greasy and bland. If you sit in the back there is a great view of a pond

...and a dumpster : /"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"I have never left a bad review before, but wow, that food was terrible! I don't know what that was, but it was not Thai food."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"The pad Thai  is too soggy and wet, if a Thai restaurant can't make a reasonable Pad Thai, then they don't have good Thai food.
I went there twice, never want to go 3rd time,   the other rice noodles are tasteless also.
The services are slow.
But they have ok appetizers."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Alas, this place seems to be getting worse and worse over the years. I tried it again last week because it was Monday and Saigon Noodles was closed. I just wanted soup. I ordered the Tom Yum. 
It comes with a little salad. It was fresh and good but the dressing was pure sugar. My daughter had the chicken satay. The peanut sauce barely resembled peanuts. It was also really, really sweet and had a few peanuts in it. My soup was sour-- not that nice sweet/sour mix that is typical with Tom Yum-- just sour. It was edible though so I ate it.
To get in and out for under $20 was nice and the service was pretty good.
Bottom line: if you are on the West Side of Madison on a Monday and want soup... lower your standards and eat here. Otherwise, go to Saigon Noodle or (if you really, really need Thai food) head to Ha Long Bay on Willie Street."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Go here at least once a month for lunch. The food is delicious, only drawback is the service is slow. But the people are friendly and the food is the best Thai in Madison."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,I have been here several times. Best Thai restaurant in Madison area. Good food with affordable price. The crispy duck curry is my favorite and they have many delicious appetizer worth to try.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"We used to come here a lot. So much so the staff recognized us upon entry. There food and service were always good. However recently the prices, portion sizes, and flavor have not been up to par. It is a nicer Thai restaurant in the area with a cozy, inviting dining area. But the prices for what you get just aren't worth it anymore.

I used to get their Pad Thai which I used to enjoy but I've found a better place that is more tasty. I like my pad thai a little dryer. The pad thai here is more saucy and the noodles more slippery. We also enjoy many of their appetizers: crab rangoon, shrimp purse, Ming sabai, egg rolls, etc. There is also a noodle dish my husband and I both enjoy. It has wider rice noodles with a darker sauce and Thai basil. We ordered here a couple months ago to try it again and our usual Thai place is much better, significantly cheaper, and larger portions.

If you looking for a nicer dine-in place then its a good place to go. But we prefer other Thai restaurants in the area."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Great first time here for dinner last night. 

Atmosphere was relaxing and quiet. It was only about 4 or 5 tables since it was an hour from closing when we arrived. Service was average.

We started with the Toong Thong for appetizer (Ground chicken, potato, carrot and onion wrapped with rice paper skin slightly deep fried to golden brown, served with house sauce). Bf's first time having Thai food and he enjoyed this. 

I had the Tom Yum soup, which is a little off from what I'm used to but it was overloaded with mushrooms and had a little spice to it. Officially one of my new favorite soups!

He had the curry fried rice with chicken. Didn't expect it to be as spicy as it was, but it was still VERY good. I had a few bites and even though it was a little too much onions, we'd definitely order it again.

It was a late dinner so I didn't get a chance to order a couple more things to introduce him to, but we'll definitely be back!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"The best Thai food in Madison, in my opinion. I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, fresh and authentic.  Especially love their sauces and Shrimp Pad Thai.  We often take our young children too and they also love the food."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"They don't have the special lunch for pineapple fried rice anymore, and it sucks. but overall the foods are good, tasty and at okay price. the That iced tea is super good and I love the gradient color of it, must order drink here. I would say it's a good place for date or dinning place instead of Thai basil with good food but only for carry out or delivery."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. lunch pad thai,"Sa Bai's two locations, one (recently renovated) on the near West Side, one further West on Odana's restaurant strip, serve reliably satisfying and tasty  Thai food and are justifiably local favorites in a town that loves Thai food and supports quite a few of them for a city of its size. Atmosphere is quite attractive and comfortable in both locations. There is a large menu with many delights; at least until recently, the Odana (not Obama, not Osama) location had several  additional dishes, especially good at dinnertime. The chefs are cooperative with spicing requests, allowing for more assertive dishes than are available in most Madison Asian restaurants. Food usually tastes fresh and lively. Soups and noodle dishes are usually excellent. Service at the University Ave location is usually quite good; the Odana location is spottier, often with long waits at dinnertime. We've had good luck with delivery from the Odana location, although certain dishes (e.g., duck) are best when eaten fresh from the kitchen."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I've had better Thai food, but their Crying Tiger, Laab, and ""traditional"" dishes (fried rice, pad thai, etc.) are pretty good. Haven't found a better alternative in the West Madison area."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Some of the tastiest Thai I've had in awhile!

The squash curry was scrumptious, bursting with flavor. 3 stars heat level (one notch below the highest they offer) was plenty for me -- they don't mess around. Pad thai and fried rice also crazy delicious. Some items are pricey ($7 to $9 for soups??) and I would have liked more veggies (onions, peppers, etc.) along with my squash and tofu, but other than that it was great.

Very nice atmosphere for eating in. The take-out scene was nuts on a Friday night; we were quoted 20 min and it ended up taking 35. Annoying, but at least you know they're making it from scratch when it takes this long. Recommend calling ahead, although confusion seemed to reign at the front counter, with orders under the wrong name, wrong food, never received, oh wait actually it's right here -- so maybe better just to dine in. They also deliver, but there is a charge if you live beyond 3 miles."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I like this place and think it is one of the better Madison Thai restaurants, though I think the other location on University is better and more consistent. Had take out and only one dish was memorable. Still, it's my go to take out place when I am visiting the parents on the west side of town."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,Not exactly the most authentic Thai food I have had. Well this wasn't exactly Thai food. For what it was it tasted good service was OK. Had to flag down the waiter multiple times to get a refill of water.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Came with some WI pals, and this is their favorite Thai place.  Wait staff was friendly and very attentive, my shrimp pad Thai was very flavorful, and they let us stay sitting and chatting for almost an hour after our meal was completed.  I didn't have room for dessert - but the cupcakes looked fantastic!  Reasonably priced featured local wine as well."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,Jungle Curry was EXACTLY what I expected. Creamy hot red curry packed with veggies and tofu. Should have been a bit spicier to be considered truly authentic Thai. Yummy 'til the last bite.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I've been the take-out queen this week.  Tonight Dad wanted Thai, so here we are.  I pulled up the menu online and ordered Pad Thai, Pad Chu Chee and two Thai Iced Teas.  They told me when to show up and it was ready when I got there.  The tea was packed with ice in one cup and the tea/milk in another so we could pour it together when we were ready.  That was groovy. 
The Pad Thai was just ok.  I get major Pad Thai cravings and this just didn't quite do the trick.  It wasn't bad, I've just had better.  The Pad Chu Chee had a nice coconut milk flavor in the sauce.  It was good.
Overall, I'd go back.  Don't remember how much it cost - it was reasonable."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I'm very hard to please and they nailed it. Great friendly service, very good peanut sauce with the chicken satay and proper beef panaeng just how I like it. The spice rating system is a little Americanized, I went with 3 out of 4 stars because when trying a new Thai place it can be dangerous to go full tilt the first time but if you can eat a jalepeno popper you can handle 4 star heat there. I've even heard that the university location does it better so I'll try them soon and report back."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Missing on every level.

Service: Was seated by the kitchen where we were feeling a cold draft coming through on occasions. Left alone for long periods of time. Right at the beginning after being seated and throughout. With water glasses siting empty for far too long. But the waitress was nice thou. 

A HUGE pet peeve happened too. Hate, Hate, Hate it when they don't bring all the entrees out at the same time. There was at least 5 minutes between each time we got our entrees. I got mine first. So was about 15 + minute till the last one came out. Bad timing on kitchens part. Luckily mine were cold items. I personally don't like to start eating till everyone has their food. I find it rude.

Food: The Shrimp Purses were tiny and cute but nothing special. Tasted like bite size egg rolls. Papaya Salad was too sweet and vinegary with no hit of fish sauce or shrimp paste. Crying Tiger had tender beef stripes but no pizzaz.  Pad Thai was ok. Not to saucy but once again missing something. The curry special was the best thing of the night.  With huge tender chucks of chicken and a kicking good peanut curry sauce.

Heat Level: They hit right on target here. Where most place miss the mark for me. I wanted super hot and I got it. WIN. (cough, cough wheres my water!)

The food was forgettable,service was non existing and kitchen disorganized. Im going to say I will never be back to this location at least."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,The food here is authentic and delicious. The thing I love most is that they use lime and fresh cilantro is many of their dishes. I would say this is the best Thai food I've ever had. Service was also pretty great both times I've been.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I've had Thai food in many different places and this was not good, unfortunately. Service good but food not recommended :/"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"We like authentic Thai food - found it here in Madison! Fantastic coconut soup, papaya salad, minced beef and I'm sure many other Thai plates...
We tried it so far twice and will surely come back!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I'm in a bad bad mood - (spoiler alert!) Jon & Kate are separating! I'll try not to take it out on Sai Bai Thong too much.

So I'm in town for Epic training at the Radisson and I figured I order some pickup right before J and K's ""special announcement"". I got back from my workout at about 7:40pm; I figured, ""Hey, I got 20 mins to spare and the place is just around the corner"". The only thing was, no one was picking up! I called about three times consecutively and still no answer. I called the other location in downtown Madison and they picked up instantly. The person on the phone just advised to call again. 

Already irritated that my precious time was dwindling, I gave them another ring and they finally answered. I put in my order, drove to the restaurant, waited another 20 mins and made it back at about 8:15. Fortunately, J&K hadn't made their announcement yet so I wasn't missing out.

Anyway, so here I was ready to plop down and enjoy the food and the show when I realized they didn't even pack me any silverware or napkins! Isn't that standard for takeout? I had to call the service desk to bring some to my room. Trifling!

Now to the food; the one thing I can say about this place is that it doesn't lack flavor. Whether that's a good thing; that is the question. I ordered Som Tum (Papaya Salad), Crying Tiger (Thai Beef Salad) and Chicken Satay. The Papaya Salad had a decent flavor which was pretty consistent throughout . The Chicken Satay was saved by the peanut sauce (probably one of the better peanut sauces I've tasted); otherwise it was average. Finally, the Thai Beef Salad was just off. When I opened the container, I had dig to find any greens. It looked like nothing but shredded strips of beef.  In that case, it should have come with tortillas. Secondly, my first bite felt like accidently taking a gulp of water from the Red Sea. Super salty!!! 

Overall, the food was ok and service was subpar - I need to find a new Thai spot to hit up whenever I'm in Madison."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,I just love their pad Thai and pa neang curry. For appetizer try their tofu summer roll. I have been here multiple times and this place has never disappointed me. Sometimes I become adventurous and order them spicy but if you are not a spice loving person don't go there.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Extensive menu with options galore. Wonderful ambiance. Pleasant staff and priced well. Side note: personally, I like my Thai ""hot"". I recommend the **** fire for those with a love for tabasco level heat.  Thank you Flora."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Food - delicious, typical Thai food. I thought they should have given 3 people at least a bowl of rice for each person, instead they served just 1 plate of rice to have us share amongst each other, which was definitely not enough. The spiciness rating system I thought could be worded better. I ordered a dish that was 2 stars, which is described as careful, wasn't very spicy at all

Price - decent, $13-$15 for an entree with tips included

Service - what are all these reviews talking about? Service was pretty good if not very good. Waitresses are always paying attention to our table, so many of these reviews don't do them justice. Maybe they changed up the staff quite a bit

Overall - I'd be coming back if I wanted to try out some more Thai dishes and would order something 3 or 4 stars on the spiciness scale"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,Anybody who has had real Thai food knows this is glorified Chinese food. Very disappointing. Way better options in Madison.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,What an absolute surprise. Was not expecting some of the best Thai I have ever had in a strip mall in Wisconsin. A great find and a destination to return to.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Compared to my regular thai food fix, in Chicago this place is good - not great.

The variety and flavor of the dishes is quite good but, the service is best described as random. Having to ask for chop sticks is just unacceptable.

As for the spice factor - adventure is not really spicy at all and should be noted in the ordering process. Also, beware the spring rolls."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,I'm surprised by the overall ratings of this place. It has held up as being my favorite Thai cuisine in Madison for many years. I'm a huge fan of the curries(have not tried much else) and the thai iced teas. It can be busy and service can be taxed-especially for takeout/delivery.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I had eaten lunch at Sa-Bai Thong a few years back and remembered it being pretty good, so while in the area running errands, my fiance and I decided to try it for dinner. While the atmosphere is clean and the decor is nice, I was very disappointed with the meal. I ordered the Pad Si Ew and my fiance ordered a yellow curry dish with tofu. While sitting at our table I could see into a small area going into the kitchen that had a microwave cart. I watched our waitress put a plate of food into the microwave which she then took out and brought right over to our table (which was my dish). She set my fiance's curry down also and quickly rushed away without checking if we needed anything else. The curry dish came missing the tofu. We waited for 10-15 minutes before the waitress came anywhere near our table (we had to flag her down) in order to tell her that there wasn't any tofu in the curry. At this time, we were pretty annoyed and also inquired as to why my dish would have been microwaved. She tried to reassure us that my dish was made fresh but that it was done before the yellow curry so she had to re-heat it... which is just poor planning. My food came dried out and the noodles were sticking together. I would have rather received our meals at different times than have my meal re-heated in the microwave. She did get my fiance a bowl of tofu for his dish but at this point, he was almost done eating. She gave us 10% off our bill for not including tofu in the dish but did not address the microwaved food.  I have had much better Thai food and service for much less money (even with the 10% off). This was a total waste of time and money and we will not be returning here."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I've come here a few times and tried a few different items, including curries, tom yum soup, and the pad kee mao. The food does not taste fresh, and is surprisingly bland for Thai food. Nothing was particularly good, and the service is slow. If you forget to ask your waiter for something, be prepared to wait a good 10 minutes until they come around next (even when the place is not at all busy). They don't bring everyone's food at once and aren't attentive enough to refill water often.

Pretty disappointing overall, I don't recommend it."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I going to preface this review by saying that, in general, I have lower expectations for service and decor at ethnic restaurants - that is why this got s 4 and not a 3.

Service/decor - I see alot of negative reviews on here citing bad service. I've been here on three occasions and each time the service has been white good. Granted, I was there weekend nights and not on a Tuesday afternoon. Decor is VERY nice compare to comparable restaurants in town.

Food - It always pleases me. I have found, and my Asian boyfriend has confirmed, that Sa-Bai is kind of a fusion between authentic Thai and what, apparently, a contingent of Madisonians want. I'm more than okay with this, as I have enjoyed every meal here.

Price - You pay for the nice decor and friendlier service. I'm willing to pay the extra 3/4 bucks an entree for that any night."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,Delicious!  We had the Tom Kha soup with shrimp (our favorite Thai dish).  We were pleasantly surprised to see lots of shrimp in the dish and cooked perfectly (not over cooked as they often are).  They were very accommodating when we requested a side dish of steamed veggies (not on the menu).  Highly recommend.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Wow...I love this place. Great Thai food..very reasonable prices. Beautiful ambiance. While waiting to be seated, there were several people coming in to pick up carry out orders. Service was very good. Highly recommended restaurant near West Towne Mall."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Food quality was below average. Adventure spicy is less than medium. I has Tom ka soup and beef pad Thai. Would not recommend. Also, employees were having a meeting on how to use the credit card machine and 2 were being reprimanded for incorrect usage. Not appropriate when customers in lobby."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Another failed attempt to find good Pad Thai in Madison. The summer rolls are good, but for the most part the food is bland. I eat thai food for the richness in flavors and the sauces here just don't cut it."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"My family and I really enjoy eating at Sa-Bai Thong - though we often forget the name of it!  We've only been to the Odana rd. location, but we have gone about 4 times now and find the food delicious, the wait staff usually attentive, and the atmosphere relaxed.

I especially like the Tom-kha gai soup (the base is a chicken broth with coconut milk), which is a great warm-up on cold Wisconsin days!  I enjoy the Pad-Thai, a tasty comfort food which reminds me of a noodle casserole.  My son enjoys the vegetarian curries, and my daughter usually gets the chicken in peanut sauce - yum.

I recommend the Sa-Bai Thong restaurant if you're in the area and craving Thai food!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Made my 2nd trip to Sa-Bai Thong. First trip was not great, but not bad. Ordered the Pad See U, which is my typical dish at Thai restaurants. It was mediocre. This time I got the Pad Thai. It was average as far as Pad Thai goes. Service was okay"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Ok, I checked in and we were seated about 5 minutes after entering the restaurant. We were given menus and then they didn't come back for 35 minutes. We ended up just leaving super hungry and a bit cranky. I think they were busier than they were expecting to be (due to the holiday and everyone not working on that day). What a huge bummer! I was so looking forward to their pad thai. I hear that it's delicious. Even though I'm super bummed, I will probably be back to try it out."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Friendly service, reasonable prices and the food had a great variety and creativity that thai restaurants often lack. The food is more american thai than authentic, but they still do a lot with that limitation. 
As a point, if you like your food spicey, you really have to request it, otherwise it will come back Madison-approved hotness free."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"It was a rainy night. I wanted pad thai take-out and Sa-Bai Thong is just a couple miles down the road. Not amazing, but it's pad thai, so what do you expect. I thought their version was solid. Thanks, Sa-Bai Thong!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Was skeptical about getting asian food in a small town but was not disappointed!  Food was delicious.   Service was slow intially but definitely got better.  You can pick how spicy you want your dishes.  One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a long time.  I wish this place was in San Jose!  We also needed separate checks because for business expense, and this is the only restaurant where they not only divided the checks up for us but they divided equally each dish we ordered, which was nice!  Definitely would recommend this place."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,They make the best Thai curries ever! My husband and I eat here often and feel that this is the best Thai place in Madison. They are very vegetarian friendly and can make any dish vegan. I have had Thai food at many places (husband loves Thai food) and we always feel like it's never as good as Sa Bai Thong. My favorite is the jungle curry!
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in town! I've been searching for good thai food for sometime now, exploring my options from the wes side to Willy st and any in between, but I always return to this location for its consistency, flavor, and service.

I love the fact that their curry sauce is more thick like gravy than soupy. The portions are always generous and the pricing for lunch is perfect. My favorites is the red duck curry. 

Their space is nicely decorated by a variety of Thai souvenirs and the the noise level is quiet, great choice for professional lunches. I highly recommend."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"When I first moved to Madison I was really excited to come to this restaurant because the man had hyped it up as a great Thai eatery.  When I finally visited the restaurant it definitely did not live up to the hype.

On the plus side the place is really nice and is a great place for dates and groups as it is very large.  However the food, as this is a restaurant, should also be great and unfortunately it was not.  I ordered a red curry dish which sounded great but was disappointed at first bite.  It's not that it was bad because it certainly wasn't but it just wasn't great.  There seemed to be something missing that I was not able to put my finger on.  The man ordered the pad Thai which he actually loved.  I didn't try any of it so I don't have anything to say about it.

As far as the presentation of the food however that was spot on.  I would recommend this place to anyone trying to venture out and try something different as the flavors are not in your face.  Also the staff was great and very attentive."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"This restaurant took me by surprise, I was craving Thai food and happened upon this place by a friend's referral.  The cuisine is great and the ambience is awesome.  I'd recommend this restaurant for those Thai food lovers in Madison."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,The décor is modern and classy.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I found it to be not very spicy so you may need to ask if you are used to very spicy thai.  The service as very prompt and friendly.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Ate here one time.
Pad Thai
Spring Rolls

The Pad Thai was the most unusual Pad Thai I've ever had, in that it really didn't taste like Pad Thai at all, was too dark looking (too much soy?) and was basically crap.

The spring rolls were a little better, but not better than the nearby Vietnamese place.
So I do not recommend this place at all.
If you want good Thai (for Madison) go to Thai Noodles on McKee.

Adios!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Here I go again, singing the praises of Chicago food.

As someone who was spoiled by having every type of food at her fingertips for eight glorious years, I really missed good Thai when I moved to Madison. I had a beef Pad Si Ew hankering from hell one day, so we ordered Sa-Bai Thong. 

Thai food should be cheap (under $10) and delicious. This was mediocre and more pricy. The sauce was thick, bland and jelly like, and there was barely any beef. 

I have given this place another shot, ordering Pad Thai the second time, and it was no better. What kind of a Thai place can't make decent Pad Thai?!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"If you need a Thai cuisine fix, this place will satisfy your cravings. I would say it's your average Americanized Thai restaurant with your standard pad thais (quite orange and sweet) and appetizer rolls. Nothing terribly special but still all right. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the noodle texture (springy, not mushy) but the sauce/flavor was a little standard.
For dishes that are meant to be spicy, you can get the spice level on a scale of ""tiny"" to ""adventure""."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I've been here a couple of times with friends and my wife. Every time, we've enjoyed our food and the service.

Our most recent experience was with a group of 6 people. Service feels like 'home' as my wife puts it. You're continually asked how you're doing and how the food is, but not in a way that is annoying. More like when your grandmother is making sure you're doing okay and eating well. So I agree with her when she says it's like home.

I usually get the curry fried rice with the ""careful"" or ""adventure"" spicy level. At times, there can be too much onion in the dish. Otherwise, it's very good. It's not too spicy that the flavor is gone. My wife has always enjoyed getting any noodle dish, so no complaints from her.

Probably one of our favorite spots here in Madison for Thai food."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I've gone here twice with a group of friends after shopping at the mall.  Both times all of us were disappointed with the flavors of the food.  On my recommendation we got the panang curry (normally my favorite everywhere else I go) but it was bland and full of huge apple chunks. I've never seen that anywhere before,  it barely had any veggies.  No carrots or potatoes or anything. And the portion was tiny for the cost.  The tom yum soup was ok but pretty sour and not very coconuty. I've had better Thai in Madison so I won't be back."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"There are better, and cheaper, places for Thai food in Madison but you still can't go too far wrong here. The service is kinda shit though. I don't know if the waitstaff have fully mastered the English language because they fuck up special requests on the reg. I don't give a shit but my friends with dietary issues do (my bud with lactose intolerance had some rancid gas after eating one of the curries with cream in it). I recommend the squash curry. Pad See Ew is should have an emphasis on the ""Eww,"" as it was greasy and bland. If you sit in the back there is a great view of a pond

...and a dumpster : /"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"I have never left a bad review before, but wow, that food was terrible! I don't know what that was, but it was not Thai food."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"The pad Thai  is too soggy and wet, if a Thai restaurant can't make a reasonable Pad Thai, then they don't have good Thai food.
I went there twice, never want to go 3rd time,   the other rice noodles are tasteless also.
The services are slow.
But they have ok appetizers."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Alas, this place seems to be getting worse and worse over the years. I tried it again last week because it was Monday and Saigon Noodles was closed. I just wanted soup. I ordered the Tom Yum. 
It comes with a little salad. It was fresh and good but the dressing was pure sugar. My daughter had the chicken satay. The peanut sauce barely resembled peanuts. It was also really, really sweet and had a few peanuts in it. My soup was sour-- not that nice sweet/sour mix that is typical with Tom Yum-- just sour. It was edible though so I ate it.
To get in and out for under $20 was nice and the service was pretty good.
Bottom line: if you are on the West Side of Madison on a Monday and want soup... lower your standards and eat here. Otherwise, go to Saigon Noodle or (if you really, really need Thai food) head to Ha Long Bay on Willie Street."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Go here at least once a month for lunch. The food is delicious, only drawback is the service is slow. But the people are friendly and the food is the best Thai in Madison."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,I have been here several times. Best Thai restaurant in Madison area. Good food with affordable price. The crispy duck curry is my favorite and they have many delicious appetizer worth to try.
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"We used to come here a lot. So much so the staff recognized us upon entry. There food and service were always good. However recently the prices, portion sizes, and flavor have not been up to par. It is a nicer Thai restaurant in the area with a cozy, inviting dining area. But the prices for what you get just aren't worth it anymore.

I used to get their Pad Thai which I used to enjoy but I've found a better place that is more tasty. I like my pad thai a little dryer. The pad thai here is more saucy and the noodles more slippery. We also enjoy many of their appetizers: crab rangoon, shrimp purse, Ming sabai, egg rolls, etc. There is also a noodle dish my husband and I both enjoy. It has wider rice noodles with a darker sauce and Thai basil. We ordered here a couple months ago to try it again and our usual Thai place is much better, significantly cheaper, and larger portions.

If you looking for a nicer dine-in place then its a good place to go. But we prefer other Thai restaurants in the area."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Great first time here for dinner last night. 

Atmosphere was relaxing and quiet. It was only about 4 or 5 tables since it was an hour from closing when we arrived. Service was average.

We started with the Toong Thong for appetizer (Ground chicken, potato, carrot and onion wrapped with rice paper skin slightly deep fried to golden brown, served with house sauce). Bf's first time having Thai food and he enjoyed this. 

I had the Tom Yum soup, which is a little off from what I'm used to but it was overloaded with mushrooms and had a little spice to it. Officially one of my new favorite soups!

He had the curry fried rice with chicken. Didn't expect it to be as spicy as it was, but it was still VERY good. I had a few bites and even though it was a little too much onions, we'd definitely order it again.

It was a late dinner so I didn't get a chance to order a couple more things to introduce him to, but we'll definitely be back!"
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"The best Thai food in Madison, in my opinion. I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, fresh and authentic.  Especially love their sauces and Shrimp Pad Thai.  We often take our young children too and they also love the food."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"They don't have the special lunch for pineapple fried rice anymore, and it sucks. but overall the foods are good, tasty and at okay price. the That iced tea is super good and I love the gradient color of it, must order drink here. I would say it's a good place for date or dinning place instead of Thai basil with good food but only for carry out or delivery."
Sa-Bai Thong West,32. pad thai,"Sa Bai's two locations, one (recently renovated) on the near West Side, one further West on Odana's restaurant strip, serve reliably satisfying and tasty  Thai food and are justifiably local favorites in a town that loves Thai food and supports quite a few of them for a city of its size. Atmosphere is quite attractive and comfortable in both locations. There is a large menu with many delights; at least until recently, the Odana (not Obama, not Osama) location had several  additional dishes, especially good at dinnertime. The chefs are cooperative with spicing requests, allowing for more assertive dishes than are available in most Madison Asian restaurants. Food usually tastes fresh and lively. Soups and noodle dishes are usually excellent. Service at the University Ave location is usually quite good; the Odana location is spottier, often with long waits at dinnertime. We've had good luck with delivery from the Odana location, although certain dishes (e.g., duck) are best when eaten fresh from the kitchen."
Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"I've always had decent service here. The wings are awesome, service was quick each time, parking is always easy and everyone is friendly. The biggest issue we had was we were here to watch a ball game and it was raining heavily for about 30mins, all the TVs went out and we missed the last part of the game.I think it was something to do with Direct TV and heavy rain affecting the signal. I would recommend this place until your watching a ball game!"
Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"Don't ever call and place an order here it's way too loud in the background and the waitress was rude. First off I tried to get the 20 wing order and she said she couldn't split it into 4 different sauces so I got smart and ordered 2 10 pieces and split it into 2 different sauces each order. She should've just done my 20 piece order. Second of all I tried to order Honey Thai wings and she said ""I don't even know what that is"" in Chicago that's one of the most popular sauces. I questioned myself and thought I had the name wrong so I looked it up and BAM hooters honey Thai wings popped up. I understand if not all locations have the same sauces but she didn't have to say that. Third they don't have a front desk or counter to pick up. You have to go to the bar to pay and pick up. The vibe was so weird. The only good thing about this were the wings."

Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"We have eaten here many times. We have never had bad service or food. We have ordered wings, fries, onion straws, chicken sliders, fried pickles, and ice cold beer. The last time we went I was a little disappointed in the cleanliness of the restaurant. They were not busy. The booths were dirty seats and tables. We switched twice looking for a clean area to eat in. This was the first time we have noticed the place being dirty. We will go back."
Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"Wanted to watch a UFC fight, and swung in here. Completely packed, but the hostess worked hard to make two spaces for me and my wife at the bar, and was over the top eager to get us seats. Very attentive bartenders.

Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"Stopped here on the way home, and worst Hooters I have been to yet! After ordering 20 wings and a fry, it took over 25 min to get our food!

When you are this close to the interstate you would think they would have somewhat descent speed. Not once saw a Manger to say something to."
Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"Perhaps the slowest service I've ever experienced.  Manager came over to tell me they forgot to drop the boneless wings.   Like that matters to me.

They offered a 6% discount which hardly numbed the pain from the poor experience.  When I first sat at the bar, the bartender was too busy flirting with a guy at the bar to even notice me.  I waited a good 10 minutes for a beer.  Poor poor service!"

Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"Worst Hooters I have ever been too. Terribly slow service, ordered all you can eat wings on a Monday night and it took them about 30 minutes to initially bring my food out. When I received my order I asked for a second order and it took about the same amount of time. She even told us it only takes about 6 to 10 minutes to cook the wings. The service was slow and they had maybe 7 others in the restaurant. I will never go back to this establishment."
Hooters,hooters daytona beach style wings,"I absolutely love this Hooters,  Every time I come in with my husband and teenaged son, the waitresses are always so pleasant and helpful.  I love their parmesan chicken wings so I keep going back for more.

I am sure that these girls make nice tips as they are so friendly to the customers.  I wish a lot of other restaurants in Madison had waitresses half as friendly as the Hooters' girls.

We had, you guessed it, wings.  The medium sauce was really, really mild. Almost flavorless.  My GF had the chipotle honey. They had a little spice to them but were mostly a sweet and tangy sticky sauce.  The sauce reminded me of something from a sesame chicken dish at a chinese buffet. I had the Naked Daytona Beach wings.  They were wings covered in a spicy barbecue sauce then grilled so the sauce would caramelize.  They were actually pretty good. 

The service was prompt and friendly.  It was like a trip to B Dubs except the entire staff was 18-25 yr old girls in Hooters outfits."

They had a little spice to them but were mostly a sweet and tangy sticky sauce.  The sauce reminded me of something from a sesame chicken dish at a chinese buffet. I had the Naked Daytona Beach wings.  They were wings covered in a spicy barbecue sauce then grilled so the sauce would caramelize.  They were actually pretty good. 

The service was prompt and friendly.  It was like a trip to B Dubs except the entire staff was 18-25 yr old girls in Hooters outfits."
Hooters,boneless wings,Hooter's has really good food and they have amazing boneless hot wings. They have lots of tvs which is hood for dporting events.

When you start a dinner like that, how can you not have fun?
I'm really bad at remembering dish names but I'm pretty sure we had the: lemongrass chicken wings, a spicy Korean soup with seafood, stir fried rice noodles with beef and  xo sauce, and pork belly with string beans. Our server was super awesome, and went along with our nonchalant ordering steez. Wish I had caught a name!

-The chicken was da bomb. Light, sauceless, and crisptastic--just what I wanted.

-The Korean soup was a little spicy for me and I wished there was more substance with the seafood.

-The rice noodles were noms. I mean, it's rice noodles and beef and sauce. It's like basic Asian comfort food, and I LOVE RICE NOODLES!

-`There's something nostalgic about string beans. Do people not eat string beans in Madison? Because I definitely never see them on the menu anywhere.

Overall, we had good times and there was mad rap and r&b on the whole time and I left with a full tummy.---I also had the avocado bubble tea and it was A+. Fresh avocado smoothie with bubbles and while I usually go sans bubbles, their bubbles made me realize that good bubbles exist in the world!

It's chill!
It's cheap! (If you're a broke biddy, check them out)
It fills you up!
I'll mostly likely be back to try more dishes."

Nam's Noodle,c5. mango chicken fried rice,"Manager refused to exchange poor plate (cartilage and beef fat instead of beef). Egg yolk in fried rice was hard fried to rubber and the sauce served with the crab Rangoon was not very good. Poor service included no drink refills and zero visits from waiter until we wanted to pay. Even then we had to walk up to the bar. There was a grand total of 12 customers in the restaurant, no excuse for poor service."
Nam's Noodle,c5. mango chicken fried rice,"-----------------------------------------
***THE GOOD***
-----------------------------------------
-The prices are fair and the delivery arrived ahead of schedule (with an asterisk - see the next section)

-The egg rolls are AMAZING. Next time I'm skipping the Crab Rangoon (see ""The Ugly"") and getting a double order of these delicious rolls!

-The Pad Thai was solid (maybe a poor choice of words) - I asked for medium spice and for a Midwesterner I'd say it's a pretty spicy medium but it's nice to challenge your taste buds! I could have used more chicken but overall was very pleased.

-General Tso's Chicken - really good flavor and texture. The portion was a bit small so I recommend getting some appetizers.

-----------------------------------------
***THE BAD***
-----------------------------------------
-As I mentioned, I ordered delivery and while the meal arrived ahead of time, it required reheating which makes me think it was sitting out on the counter for a while.

-By default, they don't include any soy or sour sauces in the bag (besides what comes standard with the appetizers) so make sure you have everything you need ahead of time!

-----------------------------------------
***THE UGLY***
-----------------------------------------
-My Crab Rangoon order was a complete joke. These were essentially just near-empty fried shells with about half a teaspoon of filling. Skip these and, like I say above, go for the double order of egg rolls. Seriously, these were so empty that I posted a photo of them to Instagram because I couldn't believe my eyes and needed the validation of social media to prove I wasn't missing something.

-The coupons on GrubHub that they offer are laughable. An order of $25 or more (excluding tax, delivery, and tip) get's a can of soda? $30 or more is the same thing but with bubble tea as an option? Please. The other Madison area Asian food restaurants offer much better coupons."

I figured that they might do the better job at noodle since it's in the restaurant name.

Nam's Noodle,c5. mango chicken fried rice,"I had the salt and pepper shrimp, which comes with a cup of soup and a dessert.  Shrimp was good, plate of about 15, served fried in a peppery batter, with some jalapenos and scallions.  You might not like that they come head-on, legs, shells and all.  Tasted really good, but annoying to eat, thinking - ""Do I look like a dumbfuck for picking off the shells?"" or ""is it dangerous to swallow so many shrimp legs?""  Then again, sucking out that shrimp head gunk presents a dilemma too.  Do you want to look like a nasty slob or not?  I erred on the side of slob.  Burp.  

Soup was vegetable broth and cabbage, carrots, tomatos.  Why even bother, just charge me a dollar less.  FAIL

Dessert (which I had to remind the server to bring out - AFTER we got the check, thank you very much) was a thin tapioca pudding, served in a rice bowl with a soup spoon  Nice sweet (some might say cloying) taste, but the watery texture was off-putting.  FAIL"

Service was not at its best. We ordered kabi, pho, and chicken stir fried and something else, all mediocre. I understand all cooks have their off days but seriously!?  3rd visit was terrible ordered the japchae lunch special served with an egg roll.  It was way too greasy. Informed the server I can't eat this, its too greasy.  I told the server to please let the kitchen know, less oil.  His respond, they don't care.  All rightly then.

The bathrooms are very well cared for and the photos there were beautiful.  The menu is expansive.  Asian dishes from many origins.  So it really just depended on what I was looking for. 

I chose the Nam's Fried Rice Combination and the Thai Style Fried Calamari.  The rice had a good flavor and had chicken, pork, and seafood mixed in with an egg on top. I would get that again if I wasn't too busy trying the other delicious sounding options.  I was not really impressed by the Calamari.  The dish was chewy and kinda boring.  The squid was served as coated rings over a bed of greens, onions, and jalapeno.  It was not how I had squid in Thailand when I was there.  The squid in the fried rice was handled better.

Nam's Noodle,c5. mango chicken fried rice,"Went here with two friends for dinner and we were all disappointed. 

The dining area is pretty small, but there is a cute little bar. Nam's is in the campus area, so it's not where I usually like to hang out. Thankfully it was a quiet night, so service should have been fine. Should have been...

My friends got their food pretty quickly and I expected mine to follow within a minute or two. I sat and waited and waited. A good 15 or so minutes passed and our waitress hadn't returned. Finally, another employee came to ask if we needed drink refills. I mentioned I was still waiting on my pho and he was really apologetic and fixed things. I got my meal and drinks for free. This was the appropriate reaction, and I'm thankful for that particular staff member for fixing things. The waitress was all like ""Oh, he didn't get his food?!"" and that was a bit perplexing.

And while they fixed things and I got  free food/drinks, it doesn't really cover up the fact that their food is mediocre. The pho was very blah and my companions complained about cheap quality of the chicken served. We all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience.

All I wanted was a good pho, and man was I disappointed. Should have went to Ha Long Bay instead."
Nam's Noodle,c5. mango chicken fried rice,"I have been very happy with soups orders from Nams. However, the chicken general Tao is disappointing. It has no meat inside it seem just skin or batter."

Like dragon I, the entrees are over priced and are often a hit or miss. Some dishes are very authentic ( such as the pho and topokee) and others are very Americanized. Most of the dishes I've tried have been suggestion (not on the menu) from friends  .If I'm feeling sick, I typically order pho from them, and that is usually pretty good. I've also tried the kimchi fried rice, which was pretty yummy as well.

In terms of the decor and the place itself, it's pretty low key but is not a nasty hole in the wall. Would be a nice play for a cute date if you're in that area and are having some Asian food cravings."
Nam's Noodle,c5. mango chicken fried rice,"I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there."

I find myself coming here a lot (usually alone lol but that's okay because the waiters are nice). I used to usually just get plain fried rice with some sort of chicken... Usually orange chicken.

Nam's Noodle,c5. mango chicken fried rice,"A few years ago Nams was one of my favorite restaurants for their quality of food. Now it just seems to have changed, a lot. Nams Fried Rice was my favorite, now it's extremely oily and too soggy. The service is quite poor - my sister and I sat in before a few other groups and they received their food first as we waited 30 minutes.

I've eaten here a few times during work, one of the worst things on the menu is Emperors Chicken - I thought it was going to be similar to something of a General Tso's chicken, but it was an entire steamed chicken with fish sauce! YUCK!!! I'm never ordering that ever, again. Recently i've been eating their pho - for take out and dine in and it's been all well. My last dine in experience was the worst. My pho had about a pinchful of noodles and a HUGE bowl of broth & meat.......... pho? really? or is it soup? 

It's an OK place to go once in awhile."

Nam's Noodle has got the Regent Street area of Wisconsin's campus covered in terms of easy and quick Vietnamese food in a comfortable setting, though after a few visits now I wouldn't venture away from the Pho.

My Brisket and Meatball Pho ($7.95) was extremely large (as pho often is), and had plenty of meat. The brisket was a little too gristle-y for me to get it again.

I wasn't a huge fan of the noodle dishes my friends got, though they seemed to like them. One of the dishes we ordered very mild and came out unbelievably spicy. Waitress was accommodating in getting a replacement.

Nam's Noodle is a good place to warm up with a lot of fine Pho soup, and if you want to rent a karaoke room."
Nam's Noodle,fn7. stir fried rice stick noodle with beef and xo sauce,"I have to be honest in that the two stars I'm giving isn't really all that fair to Nam's Noodle.

I can only eat one dish at this place as I've got a food allergy to onions; knowing full well that onions are critical to taste for a lot of dishes, I try and stick to this one dish. Also because I generally feel guilty if I have to ask to have it removed. With that said, the one dish I can eat here is OK; the barbecued honey pork ribs are pretty solid and have a pretty decent taste, but it's nothing extraordinary.

The service isn't phenomenal either; they do what they're supposed to, but they don't really go above and beyond. Also, you have to spend $20 to be able to run a credit card here, so for someone that rarely has cash, $20 is a bit too much to spend on mediocre food.

But Nam's saving grace is its traditional-style karaoke rooms. Although a lot of the songs are mostly Asian (and by this, predominantly Korean, Japanese and Chinese), there are American/English songs there as well. And while they're only MIDI-versions of the songs, it still provides a lot of fun if you've got a lot of friends with you.

I've got some pretty good memories associated with this place, but it's not somewhere I go to a lot anyways."

Nam's Noodle,fn7. stir fried rice stick noodle with beef and xo sauce,"I live nearby and there aren't as many restaurants as there are on State Street.

The dish here in general is not the same as what you would have in China, but it is modified in a more pleasant way than it is in many other Chinese restaurant in Madison. That is less greasy and less soy sauce. One cool thing about the mapo tofu is you can opt for beef in stead of pork. The Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce or garlic sauce is my favorite veggie dish and it is done in an authentic way. The beef casserole is also tasty and authentic. 
The potential factor for a bad dining experience here is the karaoke party. Although the karaoke is done in separated rooms, if you encounter lousy but loud singers like I have once, it can still be a major turn off."

But even better is the fact that this place has karaoke rooms!! I've actually been a more frequent patron of their karaoke systems than their food.

Most of the dishes I've tried have been suggestion (not on the menu) from friends  .If I'm feeling sick, I typically order pho from them, and that is usually pretty good. I've also tried the kimchi fried rice, which was pretty yummy as well.

Nam's Noodle,fn7. stir fried rice stick noodle with beef and xo sauce,"I've only ever ordered delivery from Nam's, so I don't know how it is in person. Their food is impressive enough to make them a regular in my delivery rotation, but pricey enough that I probably won't go for them more than once a month or so. Their lemongrass chicken wings were the dish that originally sold me on the place, with their surprising and delicious flavor combination, but all the typical americanized Chinese dishes I'd get anywhere else have been at least as good if not better than other places I've tried around Madison. I get bubble tea with every order--delicious and refreshing. My favorite so far is the honeydew milk tea, but I haven't tried them all yet. I tried one of their Vietnamese sandwiches recently, and it was too spicy for my taste, but from what I could taste after picking off all the peppers and still feeling like I was martyring my mouth, it seemed like the meat had a nice texture and the sauce was good...maybe just not my thing. 

Personally, my go-to takeout places are usually those that give huge portions, so I can justify the price by the fact that they give me yummy leftovers for a week...Nam's isn't like this, and it makes me sad. But it's still good enough to keep going back to, just not quite as frequently."
Nam's Noodle,fn7. stir fried rice stick noodle with beef and xo sauce,"I like nam's. Their portions are big, so I usually end up taking my food home. I find myself coming here a lot (usually alone lol but that's okay because the waiters are nice). I used to usually just get plain fried rice with some sort of chicken... Usually orange chicken. But now I'm HOOKED on their pineapple chicken fried rice. IT JUST IS DELICIOUS. Give this place a try!"
Nam's Noodle,fn7. stir fried rice stick noodle with beef and xo sauce,"A few years ago Nams was one of my favorite restaurants for their quality of food. Now it just seems to have changed, a lot. Nams Fried Rice was my favorite, now it's extremely oily and too soggy. The service is quite poor - my sister and I sat in before a few other groups and they received their food first as we waited 30 minutes.

I've eaten here a few times during work, one of the worst things on the menu is Emperors Chicken - I thought it was going to be similar to something of a General Tso's chicken, but it was an entire steamed chicken with fish sauce! YUCK!!! I'm never ordering that ever, again. Recently i've been eating their pho - for take out and dine in and it's been all well. My last dine in experience was the worst. My pho had about a pinchful of noodles and a HUGE bowl of broth & meat.......... pho? really? or is it soup? 

It's an OK place to go once in awhile."
Nam's Noodle,fn7. stir fried rice stick noodle with beef and xo sauce,"I ordered Vietnamese fresh rolls and pho.  The pho was okay, it was not the best Pho I've had, and I think it was below par for the midwest as a whole.  I'm starting to think though that Madison simply doesn't have the Asian food thing going...so by Madison standards this place might be a little better.

The fresh rolls were not very good.  They were just rice noodles, bbq pork, shrimp, and lettuce.  There was no cilantro or mint, nor any other fresh herbs--which I think is a key ingredient.  Without fresh green herbs, the fresh rolls have little flavor.  I also think the noodles used in the rolls were too big, and there was too much meat.  And the meat (both the shrimp and pork) had been cooked in a sauce that was too sweet.  This made the rolls come across as heavy, starchy, and bland.

The pho was mediocre.  I've had worse, but I'd say this is in the lower quartile of pho quality I've encountered.  The broth was heavy on the cinnamon, lacked complexity, and tasted too sweet (possibly because of too much cinnamon).

On the side I was given bean sprouts, lime, and hot pepper, but no cilantro and no basil...which in my opinion is essential.  Again, the experience was disappointing.

I could be convinced to come back to this place.  It is possible that the chefs aren't Vietnamese and just don't know how to make this type of food well.  But if I came back, I would order something different.  And as it is, this place gets two stars.  I'm no culinary genius, but the mistakes / omissions this place made were VERY basic.  Just use more fresh herbs--that's why I like Vietnamese food, and without that, I'd rather just eat at home."

When you start a dinner like that, how can you not have fun?
I'm really bad at remembering dish names but I'm pretty sure we had the: lemongrass chicken wings, a spicy Korean soup with seafood, stir fried rice noodles with beef and  xo sauce, and pork belly with string beans. Our server was super awesome, and went along with our nonchalant ordering steez. Wish I had caught a name!

-The chicken was da bomb. Light, sauceless, and crisptastic--just what I wanted.

-The Korean soup was a little spicy for me and I wished there was more substance with the seafood.

-The rice noodles were noms. I mean, it's rice noodles and beef and sauce. It's like basic Asian comfort food, and I LOVE RICE NOODLES!

-`There's something nostalgic about string beans. Do people not eat string beans in Madison? Because I definitely never see them on the menu anywhere.

Overall, we had good times and there was mad rap and r&b on the whole time and I left with a full tummy.---I also had the avocado bubble tea and it was A+. Fresh avocado smoothie with bubbles and while I usually go sans bubbles, their bubbles made me realize that good bubbles exist in the world!

It's chill!
It's cheap! (If you're a broke biddy, check them out)
It fills you up!
I'll mostly likely be back to try more dishes."
Nam's Noodle,fn3. rice stick noodle sautee with chicken,"RP11 Korean spicy pork/chicken rice plate. 
Always the best rice plate I ever had!

Nam's Noodle,fn3. rice stick noodle sautee with chicken,"Manager refused to exchange poor plate (cartilage and beef fat instead of beef). Egg yolk in fried rice was hard fried to rubber and the sauce served with the crab Rangoon was not very good. Poor service included no drink refills and zero visits from waiter until we wanted to pay. Even then we had to walk up to the bar. There was a grand total of 12 customers in the restaurant, no excuse for poor service."
Nam's Noodle,fn3. rice stick noodle sautee with chicken,"Descriptive phrase: small Vietnamese soup place.

Nam's Noodle has got the Regent Street area of Wisconsin's campus covered in terms of easy and quick Vietnamese food in a comfortable setting, though after a few visits now I wouldn't venture away from the Pho.

My Brisket and Meatball Pho ($7.95) was extremely large (as pho often is), and had plenty of meat. The brisket was a little too gristle-y for me to get it again.

I wasn't a huge fan of the noodle dishes my friends got, though they seemed to like them. One of the dishes we ordered very mild and came out unbelievably spicy. Waitress was accommodating in getting a replacement.

Nam's Noodle is a good place to warm up with a lot of fine Pho soup, and if you want to rent a karaoke room."
Nam's Noodle,fn3. rice stick noodle sautee with chicken,"I have to be honest in that the two stars I'm giving isn't really all that fair to Nam's Noodle.

I can only eat one dish at this place as I've got a food allergy to onions; knowing full well that onions are critical to taste for a lot of dishes, I try and stick to this one dish. Also because I generally feel guilty if I have to ask to have it removed. With that said, the one dish I can eat here is OK; the barbecued honey pork ribs are pretty solid and have a pretty decent taste, but it's nothing extraordinary.

The service isn't phenomenal either; they do what they're supposed to, but they don't really go above and beyond. Also, you have to spend $20 to be able to run a credit card here, so for someone that rarely has cash, $20 is a bit too much to spend on mediocre food.

But Nam's saving grace is its traditional-style karaoke rooms. Although a lot of the songs are mostly Asian (and by this, predominantly Korean, Japanese and Chinese), there are American/English songs there as well. And while they're only MIDI-versions of the songs, it still provides a lot of fun if you've got a lot of friends with you.

I've got some pretty good memories associated with this place, but it's not somewhere I go to a lot anyways."

Nam's Noodle,fn3. rice stick noodle sautee with chicken,"I had the salt and pepper shrimp, which comes with a cup of soup and a dessert.  Shrimp was good, plate of about 15, served fried in a peppery batter, with some jalapenos and scallions.  You might not like that they come head-on, legs, shells and all.  Tasted really good, but annoying to eat, thinking - ""Do I look like a dumbfuck for picking off the shells?"" or ""is it dangerous to swallow so many shrimp legs?""  Then again, sucking out that shrimp head gunk presents a dilemma too.  Do you want to look like a nasty slob or not?  I erred on the side of slob.  Burp.  

Soup was vegetable broth and cabbage, carrots, tomatos.  Why even bother, just charge me a dollar less.  FAIL

Dessert (which I had to remind the server to bring out - AFTER we got the check, thank you very much) was a thin tapioca pudding, served in a rice bowl with a soup spoon  Nice sweet (some might say cloying) taste, but the watery texture was off-putting.  FAIL"

Service was not at its best. We ordered kabi, pho, and chicken stir fried and something else, all mediocre. I understand all cooks have their off days but seriously!?  3rd visit was terrible ordered the japchae lunch special served with an egg roll.  It was way too greasy. Informed the server I can't eat this, its too greasy.  I told the server to please let the kitchen know, less oil.  His respond, they don't care.  All rightly then.  I was hoping they can remake it with less oil.  Nope.  2bites, left $15 including tip.  Good bye Nam!  Lots of choices in the Regent area."
Nam's Noodle,fn3. rice stick noodle sautee with chicken,"I have driven by Nam's Noodle many times but have never stopped.  I had an event that brought me to that part of Regent Street and I had time for dinner, so it was my first thought.

The restaurant dining room is a clean, well managed space with a good flow to the tables (they must survive football game days really well).  My Server was attentive and pleasant.  The bathrooms are very well cared for and the photos there were beautiful.  The menu is expansive.  Asian dishes from many origins.  So it really just depended on what I was looking for. 

I chose the Nam's Fried Rice Combination and the Thai Style Fried Calamari.  The rice had a good flavor and had chicken, pork, and seafood mixed in with an egg on top. I would get that again if I wasn't too busy trying the other delicious sounding options.  I was not really impressed by the Calamari.  The dish was chewy and kinda boring.  The squid was served as coated rings over a bed of greens, onions, and jalapeno.  It was not how I had squid in Thailand when I was there.  The squid in the fried rice was handled better.

I do look forward to trying more options at Nam's again.  I'm sure it will earn more stars in the future"

The dining area is pretty small, but there is a cute little bar. Nam's is in the campus area, so it's not where I usually like to hang out. Thankfully it was a quiet night, so service should have been fine. Should have been...

My friends got their food pretty quickly and I expected mine to follow within a minute or two. I sat and waited and waited. A good 15 or so minutes passed and our waitress hadn't returned. Finally, another employee came to ask if we needed drink refills. I mentioned I was still waiting on my pho and he was really apologetic and fixed things. I got my meal and drinks for free. This was the appropriate reaction, and I'm thankful for that particular staff member for fixing things. The waitress was all like ""Oh, he didn't get his food?!"" and that was a bit perplexing.

And while they fixed things and I got  free food/drinks, it doesn't really cover up the fact that their food is mediocre. The pho was very blah and my companions complained about cheap quality of the chicken served. We all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience.

All I wanted was a good pho, and man was I disappointed. Should have went to Ha Long Bay instead."

Tasted really good, but annoying to eat, thinking - ""Do I look like a dumbfuck for picking off the shells?"" or ""is it dangerous to swallow so many shrimp legs?""  Then again, sucking out that shrimp head gunk presents a dilemma too.  Do you want to look like a nasty slob or not?  I erred on the side of slob.  Burp.  

Soup was vegetable broth and cabbage, carrots, tomatos.  Why even bother, just charge me a dollar less.  FAIL

Dessert (which I had to remind the server to bring out - AFTER we got the check, thank you very much) was a thin tapioca pudding, served in a rice bowl with a soup spoon  Nice sweet (some might say cloying) taste, but the watery texture was off-putting.  FAIL"
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"One of the 2 places I often go for dinner (the other is Hong Kong station). The Vietnamese food there are quite delicious. I like various Phos and fried rice there. Waitresses/Waiters there are professional, and even when there are many people eating there, you can expect your dishes coming in the reasonable amount of time.  Moreover, you can use the ""belly"" card to earn points and get free drinks, phos and fried rice. Overall, 5 stars."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"Lunch at Nam's on Wednesday, Sunday and again on Monday.  1st visit was good!  Ordered three dishes(tofu, noodles and a chicken with peanuts) to share-all were tasty.  Excited to bring more people to try.  2nd visit they were busy...we sat in the kaoroke room.  Service was not at its best. We ordered kabi, pho, and chicken stir fried and something else, all mediocre. I understand all cooks have their off days but seriously!?  3rd visit was terrible ordered the japchae lunch special served with an egg roll.  It was way too greasy. Informed the server I can't eat this, its too greasy.  I told the server to please let the kitchen know, less oil.  His respond, they don't care.  All rightly then.  I was hoping they can remake it with less oil.  Nope.  2bites, left $15 including tip.  Good bye Nam!  Lots of choices in the Regent area."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,Great place for a quick and inexpensive meal. Try the Nam's Appetizer platter and the Kim Chi Fried Rice. Be warned that their avocado milkshake is highly addictive -- you will be back!
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I have driven by Nam's Noodle many times but have never stopped.  I had an event that brought me to that part of Regent Street and I had time for dinner, so it was my first thought.

The restaurant dining room is a clean, well managed space with a good flow to the tables (they must survive football game days really well).  My Server was attentive and pleasant.  The bathrooms are very well cared for and the photos there were beautiful.  The menu is expansive.  Asian dishes from many origins.  So it really just depended on what I was looking for. 

I chose the Nam's Fried Rice Combination and the Thai Style Fried Calamari.  The rice had a good flavor and had chicken, pork, and seafood mixed in with an egg on top. I would get that again if I wasn't too busy trying the other delicious sounding options.  I was not really impressed by the Calamari.  The dish was chewy and kinda boring.  The squid was served as coated rings over a bed of greens, onions, and jalapeno.  It was not how I had squid in Thailand when I was there.  The squid in the fried rice was handled better.

I do look forward to trying more options at Nam's again.  I'm sure it will earn more stars in the future"
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"Vegetarian spring rolls were good, but vegetarian fried rice was not tasty and didn't look very appetizing.  Also, ordered online and had to wait well past expected pickup time."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I have been going to Nam's since they opened, over 10 years ago. This spot was a favorite of mine and my hubby's. The food is tasty and the staff is friendly. My favorites are the Nam's fried rice and the chicken stick noodle (similar to a chow fun). We moved out of the state for a while and upon my return I found that their menu has since expanded and they now have many new yummy dishes.  That being said, I love my tried and true dishes."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"Went here with two friends for dinner and we were all disappointed. 

The dining area is pretty small, but there is a cute little bar. Nam's is in the campus area, so it's not where I usually like to hang out. Thankfully it was a quiet night, so service should have been fine. Should have been...

My friends got their food pretty quickly and I expected mine to follow within a minute or two. I sat and waited and waited. A good 15 or so minutes passed and our waitress hadn't returned. Finally, another employee came to ask if we needed drink refills. I mentioned I was still waiting on my pho and he was really apologetic and fixed things. I got my meal and drinks for free. This was the appropriate reaction, and I'm thankful for that particular staff member for fixing things. The waitress was all like ""Oh, he didn't get his food?!"" and that was a bit perplexing.

And while they fixed things and I got  free food/drinks, it doesn't really cover up the fact that their food is mediocre. The pho was very blah and my companions complained about cheap quality of the chicken served. We all just felt very underwhelmed by both the food and the experience.

All I wanted was a good pho, and man was I disappointed. Should have went to Ha Long Bay instead."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I have been very happy with soups orders from Nams. However, the chicken general Tao is disappointing. It has no meat inside it seem just skin or batter."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I like Nam's Noodles. They have solid food-never extraordinary, but never, ever disappointing- and the service is quick. Plus, they have bubble tea, and most Asian restaurants like this place don't! Major plus! This restaurant is in a good location, too. Would recommend the mango chicken fried rice!"
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I like their famous kimchi beef fried rice (with an egg on top!), but haven't got into any good noodle dishes so far."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I come to eat at Nam's noodle pretty often. I like vietnamese noodle salad, Pho, and kimchi fried rice. The service is fine. It tastes good in general."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"Is owned by the same people who own dragon I and serves the same exact food. I would say it's probably the best Asian food restaurant in the Regent / Monroe area, but not in Madison.

Like dragon I, the entrees are over priced and are often a hit or miss. Some dishes are very authentic ( such as the pho and topokee) and others are very Americanized. Most of the dishes I've tried have been suggestion (not on the menu) from friends  .If I'm feeling sick, I typically order pho from them, and that is usually pretty good. I've also tried the kimchi fried rice, which was pretty yummy as well.

In terms of the decor and the place itself, it's pretty low key but is not a nasty hole in the wall. Would be a nice play for a cute date if you're in that area and are having some Asian food cravings."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I was a regular at Nam's till they started decreasing their portion size for the same price.  K23 which was the beef pepper steak with rice is my favorite!!!  But this place does not appreciate customer loyalty, so please don't bother going there."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"$20 credit card minimum? EFF YOU

The customer service sucks, they tried really hard to make us pay for their mistake

Only reason it gets a 2 stars is because I enjoyed their salt and pepper pork and fried rice. All other items are laughable."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I like nam's. Their portions are big, so I usually end up taking my food home. I find myself coming here a lot (usually alone lol but that's okay because the waiters are nice). I used to usually just get plain fried rice with some sort of chicken... Usually orange chicken. But now I'm HOOKED on their pineapple chicken fried rice. IT JUST IS DELICIOUS. Give this place a try!"
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"A few years ago Nams was one of my favorite restaurants for their quality of food. Now it just seems to have changed, a lot. Nams Fried Rice was my favorite, now it's extremely oily and too soggy. The service is quite poor - my sister and I sat in before a few other groups and they received their food first as we waited 30 minutes.

I've eaten here a few times during work, one of the worst things on the menu is Emperors Chicken - I thought it was going to be similar to something of a General Tso's chicken, but it was an entire steamed chicken with fish sauce! YUCK!!! I'm never ordering that ever, again. Recently i've been eating their pho - for take out and dine in and it's been all well. My last dine in experience was the worst. My pho had about a pinchful of noodles and a HUGE bowl of broth & meat.......... pho? really? or is it soup? 

It's an OK place to go once in awhile."
Nam's Noodle,c6. pineapple chicken and shrimp fried rice,"I ordered Vietnamese fresh rolls and pho.  The pho was okay, it was not the best Pho I've had, and I think it was below par for the midwest as a whole.  I'm starting to think though that Madison simply doesn't have the Asian food thing going...so by Madison standards this place might be a little better.

The fresh rolls were not very good.  They were just rice noodles, bbq pork, shrimp, and lettuce.  There was no cilantro or mint, nor any other fresh herbs--which I think is a key ingredient.  Without fresh green herbs, the fresh rolls have little flavor.  I also think the noodles used in the rolls were too big, and there was too much meat.  And the meat (both the shrimp and pork) had been cooked in a sauce that was too sweet.  This made the rolls come across as heavy, starchy, and bland.

The pho was mediocre.  I've had worse, but I'd say this is in the lower quartile of pho quality I've encountered.  The broth was heavy on the cinnamon, lacked complexity, and tasted too sweet (possibly because of too much cinnamon).

On the side I was given bean sprouts, lime, and hot pepper, but no cilantro and no basil...which in my opinion is essential.  Again, the experience was disappointing.

I could be convinced to come back to this place.  It is possible that the chefs aren't Vietnamese and just don't know how to make this type of food well.  But if I came back, I would order something different.  And as it is, this place gets two stars.  I'm no culinary genius, but the mistakes / omissions this place made were VERY basic.  Just use more fresh herbs--that's why I like Vietnamese food, and without that, I'd rather just eat at home."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"Not very exciting at all, and definitely over priced.  I would only eat their food if someone paid for me to eat it and I were desperate to eat that day.  The ground beef had a bizarre flavor."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"I made the mistake of taking this places advice and ordering online.  I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery of a taco and chimichanga.  After an hour and 15 minutes, the food finally arrived.

The ""crispy"" taco was anything but and luke warm on top of it.  Not one crunch from the entire shell.  And the meat was nearly flavorless.  The chimichanga was the same, warm, soggy, and just as tasteless.  Even with sour cream, there was virtually no flavor.  Even the refried beans, which were cold, at very little flavor.  In addition, I had added jalapenos to the meal, something I like to snack on with meals.  These were inedible.  They started off bland and then exploded with what I can only describe as a rotten vinegar taste.  What's more, they weren't even spicy.  I didn't brave the salad after all of this and instead moved to the chips and ""salsa"".  The salsa, at least, had flavor.  Though, it wasn't very good.  I was given two kinds, but no indication as to what they were.  Neither was hot, both tasted tinny, and I only made it through two chips before I couldn't stomach any more of either.

You'd think that for $2.50 a taco, that it'd be hot, crunchy, and taste like something.  Or that for $8 a chimichanga would be hot, crisp, and seasoned properly.  But then, you'd also expect that things like jalapenos and beans are easy enough to do that they'd be edible.

Between the extremely slow turn around and the horrendous food, the menu is vastly overpriced.  If you're really going to eat something this poor in quality, you should just go to Taco Bell.  I won't eat there, or here, again but if that's what you're looking for, at least you can save money and taste your food."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"As some of the others have said this place has decent/good food. However the reason this place is getting a 2/5 is because of price. The quality of food given, all be it not bad, is not worth the price. There are much better places in the area to spend $10-$15 on dinner then the Taco Shop.

If prices were a bit lower id put this at about a 3.5."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"My girlfriend and I have hit Taco Shop maybe ten times since it opened. Madison is oddly lacking in quality Mexican (both high end and fast food), especially since the Guadalajara fire. Taco Shop is great for what it is, which is fast tacos and burritos. I've never had a bad experience there, including delivery. It' s not as good as Mexican in SoCal or Texas, but it's convenient and it's light years ahead of garbage like Taco Bell, obviously. Between here and Gemelos on State, I'd choose Taco Shop."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"My experience with the Taco Shop was as extreme letdown. My friend and I hit up Taco Shop after one night and were thoroughly disappointed with our experience. I could have made the tacos at home. The tortilla was cold, the cheese tasted like Sargento - not melty and delicious like the asadero cheese from Burrito Drive or the Sabores Latinos food cart. Not even decent enough for a late night snack. Horrible horrible horrible."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"THE BRANCH BROUGHT IN FROM AMSTERDAM BREAKS
When I looked at the menu I immediately and naturally made up my mind and ordered 3 soft shell tacos, and a side of guacamole that totaled a little under $10.  I thought I would try each of the different meats they offer.  Shredded beef, ground beef, and shredded chicken.  This was disappointing because I like the option of grilled meats.  

The tacos were nothing special.  Although they are stuffed with the standard which includes: meat, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and pica de gallo, the flavor was nothing special.  When I think of tasty mexican fare that has been memorable I think of big bold flavors.  The two salsas that were served were both red.  Mild was not very flavorful, the hot was and added a nice little kick to the tacos.  The gauc. was good.  Although, it was very smooth.  The guac had no chunks of avocado, the texture made it seem as though it had all been run through a blender.  I also think that it was more of a crema which did not please me.  What was nice is that they included a small handful of chips which were very good.  Thin, fresh, and salted to perfection.  
Out of the tacos meats I liked the shredded beef the best.  Would I go back?  Sure, but I would not get the tacos again.  Hopefully the chimi will have better luck."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"The Taco shop has great burritos and tacos (and so cheap!)

Not only were we all stuffed for under $20, plus a big tip for the ultra cool guys running the joint, the food was phenomenal. The carnitas and avocado taco and the pulled pork nachos with queso were melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. Next time you're down there, skip the pizza and the chain Mexican food and give the Mexi-Cali inspired Taco Bros. a try. You won't be disappointed (unless of course tragic encounters with boring chain restaurant food has left your taste buds too shriveled and dying to get down)."
The Taco Shop,ground beef taco salad,"I've never been all that into skiing. I always considered myself more of a snowboarder. Skiing just always seemed so easy. Anyone can make a pizza slice with their skis and head down a hill. Piece of cake. You see children doing it all the time.

That's the thing about skiing though...it's only really easy at the beginning. Most people can do it, but it takes so much time and energy to get truly great at skiing. There is a night-and-day difference between the people on the bunny hills and the people hitting the double black diamonds.

In this way, making tacos is pretty much exactly like skiing. Anyone (even a child) can make something and call it a taco...but to make a truly great taco...that takes something special. The Taco Shop does not have that something. The Taco Shop hasn't begun to even consider the possibility of taking the ski lift up the mountain. The Taco Shop is stuck on the bunny hills.

I arrived shortly after 9pm with a small group of friends. There was a decent sized group of people there when we arrived, but they had all finished eating. By the looks of things, the kitchen was waiting for our orders to come in. I ordered three tacos at the counter: carne asada (steak), carnitas (pork), and a roasted veggie. When you order three tacos you also receive beans (black or pinto) and rice on the side. 

We waited somewhere between 5-10 minutes for our food to be brought to the table. While we waited we had some time to take in the decor. The place looks nice enough. They were clearly on a budget, but it all came together okay. It appears they're going for a bit of a west coast nautical theme. They have a surfboard mounted on one of the walls and the color scheme is indicative of a Southern California beach shack...but, confusingly, they don't offer any seafood tacos. No shrimp. No fish. Nothing. Weird. Oh well.

Before the food arrived a friend asked if they make their own corn tortillas in house. We were informed they do not...and you could tell. The individual tortillas were extremely thick to begin with, and, inexplicably, they doubled them up.

All three tacos I ordered looking fairly traditional. The carne asada was served with onion, cilantro, and avocado, the carnitas had just cilantro, and the veggie was topped with a bit of cheese. My guess is that this minimalist preparation is designed to really highlight the meat...which is unfortunate because the meat wasn't noteworthy in any way. The carne asada was pretty well cooked but had virtually no seasoning, and the carnitas were the exact opposite.

All of the issues I had with the tacos could have forgiven if there had been some selection of homemade salsas to accompany my tacos, but, alas, there was no salsa bar in sight.

Onto the sides...the beans were fine. Nothing special, but not bad. The rice on the other hand was terrible. It had the consistency of Uncle Ben's minute rice. I would not be surprised if it had been microwaved.

I've really struggled to figure out why it would take more than 2 minutes to dish out tacos when the kitchen isn't making its own tortillas or salsas. You're basically just scooping meat into a shell.

If you're looking for good late night food hit up any one of the food carts dotted throughout Madison. If you're looking to support a local business in the vicinity walk straight out of the Taco Shop and head to Ians Pizza. If you're looking for a mediocre taco you can find Qdoba and Chipotle right on State St.

I was given two kinds, but no indication as to what they were.  Neither was hot, both tasted tinny, and I only made it through two chips before I couldn't stomach any more of either.

You'd think that for $2.50 a taco, that it'd be hot, crunchy, and taste like something.  Or that for $8 a chimichanga would be hot, crisp, and seasoned properly.  But then, you'd also expect that things like jalapenos and beans are easy enough to do that they'd be edible.

Between the extremely slow turn around and the horrendous food, the menu is vastly overpriced.  If you're really going to eat something this poor in quality, you should just go to Taco Bell.  I won't eat there, or here, again but if that's what you're looking for, at least you can save money and taste your food."
The Taco Shop,braised beef taco,"As some of the others have said this place has decent/good food. However the reason this place is getting a 2/5 is because of price. The quality of food given, all be it not bad, is not worth the price. There are much better places in the area to spend $10-$15 on dinner then the Taco Shop.

If prices were a bit lower id put this at about a 3.5."
The Taco Shop,braised beef taco,"My girlfriend and I have hit Taco Shop maybe ten times since it opened. Madison is oddly lacking in quality Mexican (both high end and fast food), especially since the Guadalajara fire. Taco Shop is great for what it is, which is fast tacos and burritos. I've never had a bad experience there, including delivery. It' s not as good as Mexican in SoCal or Texas, but it's convenient and it's light years ahead of garbage like Taco Bell, obviously. Between here and Gemelos on State, I'd choose Taco Shop."
The Taco Shop,braised beef taco,"My experience with the Taco Shop was as extreme letdown. My friend and I hit up Taco Shop after one night and were thoroughly disappointed with our experience. I could have made the tacos at home. The tortilla was cold, the cheese tasted like Sargento - not melty and delicious like the asadero cheese from Burrito Drive or the Sabores Latinos food cart. Not even decent enough for a late night snack. Horrible horrible horrible."
The Taco Shop,braised beef taco,"THE BRANCH BROUGHT IN FROM AMSTERDAM BREAKS
When I looked at the menu I immediately and naturally made up my mind and ordered 3 soft shell tacos, and a side of guacamole that totaled a little under $10.  I thought I would try each of the different meats they offer.  Shredded beef, ground beef, and shredded chicken.  This was disappointing because I like the option of grilled meats.  

The tacos were nothing special.  Although they are stuffed with the standard which includes: meat, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and pica de gallo, the flavor was nothing special.  When I think of tasty mexican fare that has been memorable I think of big bold flavors.  The two salsas that were served were both red.  Mild was not very flavorful, the hot was and added a nice little kick to the tacos.  The gauc. was good.  Although, it was very smooth.  The guac had no chunks of avocado, the texture made it seem as though it had all been run through a blender.  I also think that it was more of a crema which did not please me.  What was nice is that they included a small handful of chips which were very good.  Thin, fresh, and salted to perfection.  
Out of the tacos meats I liked the shredded beef the best.  Would I go back?  Sure, but I would not get the tacos again.  Hopefully the chimi will have better luck."

The Taco Shop,braised beef taco,"I've never been all that into skiing. I always considered myself more of a snowboarder. Skiing just always seemed so easy. Anyone can make a pizza slice with their skis and head down a hill. Piece of cake. You see children doing it all the time.

That's the thing about skiing though...it's only really easy at the beginning. Most people can do it, but it takes so much time and energy to get truly great at skiing. There is a night-and-day difference between the people on the bunny hills and the people hitting the double black diamonds.

In this way, making tacos is pretty much exactly like skiing. Anyone (even a child) can make something and call it a taco...but to make a truly great taco...that takes something special. The Taco Shop does not have that something. The Taco Shop hasn't begun to even consider the possibility of taking the ski lift up the mountain. The Taco Shop is stuck on the bunny hills.

I arrived shortly after 9pm with a small group of friends. There was a decent sized group of people there when we arrived, but they had all finished eating. By the looks of things, the kitchen was waiting for our orders to come in. I ordered three tacos at the counter: carne asada (steak), carnitas (pork), and a roasted veggie. When you order three tacos you also receive beans (black or pinto) and rice on the side. 

We waited somewhere between 5-10 minutes for our food to be brought to the table. While we waited we had some time to take in the decor. The place looks nice enough. They were clearly on a budget, but it all came together okay. It appears they're going for a bit of a west coast nautical theme. They have a surfboard mounted on one of the walls and the color scheme is indicative of a Southern California beach shack...but, confusingly, they don't offer any seafood tacos. No shrimp. No fish. Nothing. Weird. Oh well.

Before the food arrived a friend asked if they make their own corn tortillas in house. We were informed they do not...and you could tell. The individual tortillas were extremely thick to begin with, and, inexplicably, they doubled them up.

All three tacos I ordered looking fairly traditional. The carne asada was served with onion, cilantro, and avocado, the carnitas had just cilantro, and the veggie was topped with a bit of cheese. My guess is that this minimalist preparation is designed to really highlight the meat...which is unfortunate because the meat wasn't noteworthy in any way. The carne asada was pretty well cooked but had virtually no seasoning, and the carnitas were the exact opposite.

All of the issues I had with the tacos could have forgiven if there had been some selection of homemade salsas to accompany my tacos, but, alas, there was no salsa bar in sight.

Onto the sides...the beans were fine. Nothing special, but not bad. The rice on the other hand was terrible. It had the consistency of Uncle Ben's minute rice. I would not be surprised if it had been microwaved.

I've really struggled to figure out why it would take more than 2 minutes to dish out tacos when the kitchen isn't making its own tortillas or salsas. You're basically just scooping meat into a shell.

If you're looking for good late night food hit up any one of the food carts dotted throughout Madison. If you're looking to support a local business in the vicinity walk straight out of the Taco Shop and head to Ians Pizza. If you're looking for a mediocre taco you can find Qdoba and Chipotle right on State St.

The ""crispy"" taco was anything but and luke warm on top of it.  Not one crunch from the entire shell.  And the meat was nearly flavorless.  The chimichanga was the same, warm, soggy, and just as tasteless.  Even with sour cream, there was virtually no flavor.  Even the refried beans, which were cold, at very little flavor.  In addition, I had added jalapenos to the meal, something I like to snack on with meals.  These were inedible.

Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"Went for wings last night.  It is a wing joint, after all.  Ordered our wings extra, super crispy.  Like 30 minutes later, they bring out rubbery chicken skin wings.  We sent them back.  Manager came over, and had the NERVE to tell us ""that's why I order boneless wings"".  Really?  You manage a wing joint, and you don't even eat chicken wings?  Boneless wings are NOT wings.  They are chicken breast.
So, after ANOTHER freaking 30 minutes, they bring out our ""new"" wings.  Yup, you guessed it!!  RUBBERY SKIN WINGS!!  I told our waitress, ""bring the bill for the sodas"".
So, we sat there for a damn HOUR, and they never actually got our freaking order right.  We left without eating.  They need to fire their cooks, and get someone in there that is smart enough to touch the wing, and know it's not crispy!! 
And, 7 freaking dollars for two sodas!!!  
It's funny too, cause on the way out, there is a sign on the door that says ""Come hungry, leave triumphant"".  HA!  B*llsh*t!
It will be a cold day in hell before we go back there!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"The last time my husband and I went to this location our service was horrible. We sat in the bar section and the waiter we had was not attentive at all. Than we sat there waiting to give our order and we had to go to the bar to ask for our waiter to come back. He was more interested in the bigger groups in the area than us and the other smaller tables. 

We are also very unhappy with the fact that the sizes for the wings have changed but the prices have not. So now you get five wings for the price you would have gotten six. Very unhappy with that. We love Buffalo Wild Wings but don't like the changes that have been made!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"I met 2 friends here last weekend. My first time as I usually don't go to chain restaurants. We ordered 4 different appetizers: 12 wings, o-rings, garlic mushroom and a flat bread.  The flat bread was good as were the shrooms. The wings were mediocre at best (was surprised by this considering this IS their business)., dry and not great sauces. We each had 2 drinks and the cost came to $35.00 each. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I wasted my money on nothing. The server was incompetent. She actually told us that if we needed her, just wave our hands. HA! Long wait for food, long wait for the bill. Not a place I'd ever go to again. Ick!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"OVERPRICED but a fun place to meet, snack and watch sports.  Good beer selection."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"Look-the Madison/Monona area is hard up for a good wing place and BW3 is not going to solve that problem anytime soon. But some of the reviews here are a bit unfair. It's like reviewing McDonalds and complaining it's not the best burger of your life. This place is the McDonald's of wings with beer.  It's good for what it is. The service is friendly and both times we've gone there in the past month the manager comes around asking if everything is ok. Nice touch. The limited time Asian sauce is a good one and the relatively new mango habanero is really tasty. Somehow the bill always surprises me-as though I feel like I am getting ripped off for what I'm getting-but the place has little control over that. All in all, if you live in the area, this may be your only option for a variety of sauces from which to choose and if you keep in mind that this is the McDonald's of wings and beer it's not half bad."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"I give this place a very happy three stars. 

Got the lunch special 12 boneless wings, fries,  and carrots for $10. 

It's a bit steep for a lunch but it the boneless chicken wings were very good,  did not get a bite of tendon or mystery crunch such as you would from other boneless chicken wings. 

They let me choose as many flavors as I wanted so I settled for garlic parmesan,  Caribbean jerk,  and mango habanero.

All the flavors covered the wings very generously and were very finger-lickin good!  I loved how they really meant Hot when they marked the mango habanero - No weak sauce here!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.

It's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"So here to catch lunch. Sit at bar.  Not real busy at all.  Order wings...thats what they do right??? Two guys at bar get their BURGERS before my wings come!   Never been a big fan of this place and another reason not to be, besides being over priced."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"Worst B Dub's ever........

So it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.

It gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.

By this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  

As we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.

I called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.

I'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"Whomever said this is the McDonalds of wings was spot on.

No the service isn't five star. No the food isn't five star. Yes it is a chain restaurant. Yes the staff are likely minimum wage with lots of turnover. TV's and music too loud even on the patio which is next to a parking lot but they did turn it down when asked. 

To the rest of the folks writing reviews I say ...what exactly were you expecting...?

We go about twice per month and I usually have the BBQ Chicken salad and my wife has the street tacos with shrimp substituted in.  Not five star but consistently pretty good, definitely a bigger salad than I can eat.  Annoying that they charge you 60 cents for an extra dressing. Servers are hit-n-miss but overall about what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  They are quick to right a mistake with 25 percent off or a free entrée if it wasn't what you ordered. 

For example, I ordered a large beer and the keg ran out leaving about 1 inch at the top of the glass that normally would have had beer.  I didn't think much of it but a few minutes later after they swapped the keg out came another large beer to make up for the first.  Never had to ask nor did I expect it.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service.

I signed up for the blazin-rewards program a while back and this location, on more than one occasion, banks the points from customers that pay after you until (I think) someone else in the rewards program bumps you from the queue.  This turned into a free medium sized wings for us ($15) and I also used a survey credit ($5) on the same bill.  Lunch for the two of us that day was $8 including tip.

So lighten up, go eat something and enjoy the ice-cold beer."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"To be quite honest with you, I think Buffalo Wild Wings is overrated. My boyfriend and I have been here twice, but there's nothing special about it compared to any other place.

My boyfriend prefers the wings here, compared to those at Pizza Hut that we usually get, but it's actually vice versa for me. For me, the BBQ sauce on the wings I got here tasted the same as what I can get at Pizza Hut. So why PAY more for less at B-Dubs when I can GET more for less at Pizza Hut?

The cheese curds, fried pickles, and shrimp tacos are good, but the appetizers are vastly overpriced. You get an extremely small order for the price of what should be enough for two people. It's just not worth it. Furthermore, out of all the desserts here, I've only tried the fried cheesecake bites and they weren't good at all. The texture was strange and the flavor was lacking.

Overall, I don't think I'll be going here anymore."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"I prefer this  Buffalo Wild Wings  location over the Fitchburg location as there tends to be less little kids having loud birthday party's here. 
The buffalo ranch chicken wrap is always tasty as are the soft pretzels. 
Good food at a fair price."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"I love buffalo wild wings  food, but their service everywhere in the madison area lacks significantly."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"This is by far the best Buffalo Wild Wings in Madison! You can always count on their food being just what you expected, where as other locations are hit or miss. The service is always pretty decent. They have many T.V's so you can watch a game or follow multiple games. They also offer trivia, which is sometimes fun to play if your going to be there for a few hours. Tuesdays is 45 cent wing night and Thursday is 60 cent (Can't remember how much?) boneless wing night. They offer Coke products which makes me sad, but I can get over it, because their wings are soooo good. My favorite sauces: Medium and Asian Zing!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"I like to think I have a pretty good eye for restaurants - simply eyeballing a place will usually tell me roughly how good it's going to be.  I eyeballed this place and my intuition told me: BAD.  Or at least generic.  Big sports bar, cheesy gimmicks, giant TV's, overly perky waitresses, a huge meandering menu, and empty tables everywhere.  

But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.

Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!

My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.

Were I ever to be in Monona, WI again (somewhat unlikely) I would come back."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"In short: a standard wings place. Lots of sauces, lots of chicken, lots of TVs. However, both their food and service was better than the downtown location. Our server was great and ridiculously ninja-like: refills would appear and empty dishes would disappear, bills would show up only to disappear and reappear with change, all without anyone at our table of five noticing. 

It gets three stars because it's nothing special, but if it was a world of chains and average food everywhere, it'd get five."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"Worst wings ever. I ordered boneless wings and a beer. The sauce on the wings was  applied unevenly. The wings themselves were horribly hard, dried out little nuggets that were completely unappetizing. The beer was flat and it wasn't even a full pour which appeared to be because the beer was warm and flat. Like other viewers I experienced awful after effects from the food which must be due to poor hygiene in the kitchen - I can only imagine. BWW will not be getting return business from me."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"There isn't much that stands out from this particular Buffalo Wild Wings compared to others I have been to aside from the service we received at this location. Our server was very friendly and helpful the entire time, however it turns out that he made a mistake and forgot to put our order in. My husband and I noticed it was taking a while but didn't mention it to anybody working there. We just figured it was a busy afternoon. When they realized the mistake they made the manager came up to our table and explained the situation and apologized. She also said that because of their mistake they would be giving us 25% off of our bill. Our server then also apologized multiple times.

The fact that we didn't even complain and that they realized their own mistake and made up for it when we were practically oblivious to the situation really impressed me. I work in an office close by to this BWW and will definitely make sure to give them more business in the future because of this. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food itself isn't anything special, but that being said I do enjoy their wings more than most places!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"Yikes. An atrocious sports bar with 3,000 flat panel TVs, and a laminated menu book. 

If you must go here, and don't have time to hang yourself before, stick to the bone-in wings, avoid the useless sauces at all cost, and order lots of drinks to numb the pain.

Actually, the mixed drinks can be pretty good. Better yet, avoid the food and toss a few back at the bar instead."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,Not a fan. Quaker steak wings are better. To each their own. Never been impressed with the wings. Watching a game with the guys is good time with some drinks but the food quality is always subpar at best.
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"I went a few weeks ago to meet girlfriends for drinks and dinner. The service was great to start but as we we're waiting for people our waitress stopped coming by. We could barely flag her down and then she passed us off to another waitress. The next waitress was better. The food was good for a chain. I had the naked tenders with Parmesan garlic.

Buffalo Wild Wings is what it is. It is an ok place to meet people and play trivia and drink. I only go to chains when other people choose them. I'd give it a 2.5 but since the second waitress was better and the food was pretty good I can give it a 3."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size traditional wings,"We went to Buff' Wild Wings to watch the UFC fights... Not for the food. The food was edible. This said I had no expectations that the food would be phenomenal. We ordered opinion rings - they were OK, predictably bland. Wings, three flavors, so-so. One would think that the wings would be a standout - but not unexpected. We also had a loaded potato skin-esque thing. It was the best thing we ordered. The celery was good - nice crunch. 

Look this place met my entertainment expectations. We didn't go for the food and I wouldn't go for the food... But if you are looking for a place that is going to reliably have the UFC pay per views - Buff Wild Wings will meet this expectation."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"Went for wings last night.  It is a wing joint, after all.  Ordered our wings extra, super crispy.  Like 30 minutes later, they bring out rubbery chicken skin wings.  We sent them back.  Manager came over, and had the NERVE to tell us ""that's why I order boneless wings"".  Really?  You manage a wing joint, and you don't even eat chicken wings?  Boneless wings are NOT wings.  They are chicken breast.
So, after ANOTHER freaking 30 minutes, they bring out our ""new"" wings.  Yup, you guessed it!!  RUBBERY SKIN WINGS!!  I told our waitress, ""bring the bill for the sodas"".
So, we sat there for a damn HOUR, and they never actually got our freaking order right.  We left without eating.  They need to fire their cooks, and get someone in there that is smart enough to touch the wing, and know it's not crispy!! 
And, 7 freaking dollars for two sodas!!!  
It's funny too, cause on the way out, there is a sign on the door that says ""Come hungry, leave triumphant"".  HA!  B*llsh*t!
It will be a cold day in hell before we go back there!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"The last time my husband and I went to this location our service was horrible. We sat in the bar section and the waiter we had was not attentive at all. Than we sat there waiting to give our order and we had to go to the bar to ask for our waiter to come back. He was more interested in the bigger groups in the area than us and the other smaller tables. 

We are also very unhappy with the fact that the sizes for the wings have changed but the prices have not. So now you get five wings for the price you would have gotten six. Very unhappy with that. We love Buffalo Wild Wings but don't like the changes that have been made!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"I met 2 friends here last weekend. My first time as I usually don't go to chain restaurants. We ordered 4 different appetizers: 12 wings, o-rings, garlic mushroom and a flat bread.  The flat bread was good as were the shrooms. The wings were mediocre at best (was surprised by this considering this IS their business)., dry and not great sauces. We each had 2 drinks and the cost came to $35.00 each. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I wasted my money on nothing. The server was incompetent. She actually told us that if we needed her, just wave our hands. HA! Long wait for food, long wait for the bill. Not a place I'd ever go to again. Ick!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"OVERPRICED but a fun place to meet, snack and watch sports.  Good beer selection."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"Look-the Madison/Monona area is hard up for a good wing place and BW3 is not going to solve that problem anytime soon. But some of the reviews here are a bit unfair. It's like reviewing McDonalds and complaining it's not the best burger of your life. This place is the McDonald's of wings with beer.  It's good for what it is. The service is friendly and both times we've gone there in the past month the manager comes around asking if everything is ok. Nice touch. The limited time Asian sauce is a good one and the relatively new mango habanero is really tasty. Somehow the bill always surprises me-as though I feel like I am getting ripped off for what I'm getting-but the place has little control over that. All in all, if you live in the area, this may be your only option for a variety of sauces from which to choose and if you keep in mind that this is the McDonald's of wings and beer it's not half bad."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"I give this place a very happy three stars. 

Got the lunch special 12 boneless wings, fries,  and carrots for $10. 

It's a bit steep for a lunch but it the boneless chicken wings were very good,  did not get a bite of tendon or mystery crunch such as you would from other boneless chicken wings. 

They let me choose as many flavors as I wanted so I settled for garlic parmesan,  Caribbean jerk,  and mango habanero.

All the flavors covered the wings very generously and were very finger-lickin good!  I loved how they really meant Hot when they marked the mango habanero - No weak sauce here!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.

It's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"So here to catch lunch. Sit at bar.  Not real busy at all.  Order wings...thats what they do right??? Two guys at bar get their BURGERS before my wings come!   Never been a big fan of this place and another reason not to be, besides being over priced."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"Worst B Dub's ever........

So it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.

It gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.

By this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  

As we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.

I called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.

I'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"Whomever said this is the McDonalds of wings was spot on.

No the service isn't five star. No the food isn't five star. Yes it is a chain restaurant. Yes the staff are likely minimum wage with lots of turnover. TV's and music too loud even on the patio which is next to a parking lot but they did turn it down when asked. 

To the rest of the folks writing reviews I say ...what exactly were you expecting...?

We go about twice per month and I usually have the BBQ Chicken salad and my wife has the street tacos with shrimp substituted in.  Not five star but consistently pretty good, definitely a bigger salad than I can eat.  Annoying that they charge you 60 cents for an extra dressing. Servers are hit-n-miss but overall about what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  They are quick to right a mistake with 25 percent off or a free entrée if it wasn't what you ordered. 

For example, I ordered a large beer and the keg ran out leaving about 1 inch at the top of the glass that normally would have had beer.  I didn't think much of it but a few minutes later after they swapped the keg out came another large beer to make up for the first.  Never had to ask nor did I expect it.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service.

I signed up for the blazin-rewards program a while back and this location, on more than one occasion, banks the points from customers that pay after you until (I think) someone else in the rewards program bumps you from the queue.  This turned into a free medium sized wings for us ($15) and I also used a survey credit ($5) on the same bill.  Lunch for the two of us that day was $8 including tip.

So lighten up, go eat something and enjoy the ice-cold beer."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"To be quite honest with you, I think Buffalo Wild Wings is overrated. My boyfriend and I have been here twice, but there's nothing special about it compared to any other place.

My boyfriend prefers the wings here, compared to those at Pizza Hut that we usually get, but it's actually vice versa for me. For me, the BBQ sauce on the wings I got here tasted the same as what I can get at Pizza Hut. So why PAY more for less at B-Dubs when I can GET more for less at Pizza Hut?

The cheese curds, fried pickles, and shrimp tacos are good, but the appetizers are vastly overpriced. You get an extremely small order for the price of what should be enough for two people. It's just not worth it. Furthermore, out of all the desserts here, I've only tried the fried cheesecake bites and they weren't good at all. The texture was strange and the flavor was lacking.

Overall, I don't think I'll be going here anymore."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"I prefer this  Buffalo Wild Wings  location over the Fitchburg location as there tends to be less little kids having loud birthday party's here. 
The buffalo ranch chicken wrap is always tasty as are the soft pretzels. 
Good food at a fair price."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"I love buffalo wild wings  food, but their service everywhere in the madison area lacks significantly."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"This is by far the best Buffalo Wild Wings in Madison! You can always count on their food being just what you expected, where as other locations are hit or miss. The service is always pretty decent. They have many T.V's so you can watch a game or follow multiple games. They also offer trivia, which is sometimes fun to play if your going to be there for a few hours. Tuesdays is 45 cent wing night and Thursday is 60 cent (Can't remember how much?) boneless wing night. They offer Coke products which makes me sad, but I can get over it, because their wings are soooo good. My favorite sauces: Medium and Asian Zing!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"I like to think I have a pretty good eye for restaurants - simply eyeballing a place will usually tell me roughly how good it's going to be.  I eyeballed this place and my intuition told me: BAD.  Or at least generic.  Big sports bar, cheesy gimmicks, giant TV's, overly perky waitresses, a huge meandering menu, and empty tables everywhere.  

But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.

Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!

My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.

Were I ever to be in Monona, WI again (somewhat unlikely) I would come back."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"In short: a standard wings place. Lots of sauces, lots of chicken, lots of TVs. However, both their food and service was better than the downtown location. Our server was great and ridiculously ninja-like: refills would appear and empty dishes would disappear, bills would show up only to disappear and reappear with change, all without anyone at our table of five noticing. 

It gets three stars because it's nothing special, but if it was a world of chains and average food everywhere, it'd get five."
Buffalo Wild Wings,snack size boneless wings,"Worst wings ever. I ordered boneless wings and a beer. The sauce on the wings was  applied unevenly. The wings themselves were horribly hard, dried out little nuggets that were completely unappetizing. The beer was flat and it wasn't even a full pour which appeared to be because the beer was warm and flat. Like other viewers I experienced awful after effects from the food which must be due to poor hygiene in the kitchen - I can only imagine. BWW will not be getting return business from me."

Buffalo Wild Wings,small boneless wings,Not a fan. Quaker steak wings are better. To each their own. Never been impressed with the wings. Watching a game with the guys is good time with some drinks but the food quality is always subpar at best.
Buffalo Wild Wings,small boneless wings,"I went a few weeks ago to meet girlfriends for drinks and dinner. The service was great to start but as we we're waiting for people our waitress stopped coming by. We could barely flag her down and then she passed us off to another waitress. The next waitress was better. The food was good for a chain. I had the naked tenders with Parmesan garlic.

Buffalo Wild Wings is what it is. It is an ok place to meet people and play trivia and drink. I only go to chains when other people choose them. I'd give it a 2.5 but since the second waitress was better and the food was pretty good I can give it a 3."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small boneless wings,"We went to Buff' Wild Wings to watch the UFC fights... Not for the food. The food was edible. This said I had no expectations that the food would be phenomenal. We ordered opinion rings - they were OK, predictably bland. Wings, three flavors, so-so. One would think that the wings would be a standout - but not unexpected. We also had a loaded potato skin-esque thing. It was the best thing we ordered. The celery was good - nice crunch. 

Look this place met my entertainment expectations. We didn't go for the food and I wouldn't go for the food... But if you are looking for a place that is going to reliably have the UFC pay per views - Buff Wild Wings will meet this expectation."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"Went for wings last night.  It is a wing joint, after all.  Ordered our wings extra, super crispy.  Like 30 minutes later, they bring out rubbery chicken skin wings.  We sent them back.  Manager came over, and had the NERVE to tell us ""that's why I order boneless wings"".  Really?  You manage a wing joint, and you don't even eat chicken wings?  Boneless wings are NOT wings.  They are chicken breast.
So, after ANOTHER freaking 30 minutes, they bring out our ""new"" wings.  Yup, you guessed it!!  RUBBERY SKIN WINGS!!  I told our waitress, ""bring the bill for the sodas"".
So, we sat there for a damn HOUR, and they never actually got our freaking order right.  We left without eating.  They need to fire their cooks, and get someone in there that is smart enough to touch the wing, and know it's not crispy!! 
And, 7 freaking dollars for two sodas!!!  
It's funny too, cause on the way out, there is a sign on the door that says ""Come hungry, leave triumphant"".  HA!  B*llsh*t!
It will be a cold day in hell before we go back there!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"The last time my husband and I went to this location our service was horrible. We sat in the bar section and the waiter we had was not attentive at all. Than we sat there waiting to give our order and we had to go to the bar to ask for our waiter to come back. He was more interested in the bigger groups in the area than us and the other smaller tables. 

We are also very unhappy with the fact that the sizes for the wings have changed but the prices have not. So now you get five wings for the price you would have gotten six. Very unhappy with that. We love Buffalo Wild Wings but don't like the changes that have been made!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"I met 2 friends here last weekend. My first time as I usually don't go to chain restaurants. We ordered 4 different appetizers: 12 wings, o-rings, garlic mushroom and a flat bread.  The flat bread was good as were the shrooms. The wings were mediocre at best (was surprised by this considering this IS their business)., dry and not great sauces. We each had 2 drinks and the cost came to $35.00 each. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I wasted my money on nothing. The server was incompetent. She actually told us that if we needed her, just wave our hands. HA! Long wait for food, long wait for the bill. Not a place I'd ever go to again. Ick!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"Look-the Madison/Monona area is hard up for a good wing place and BW3 is not going to solve that problem anytime soon. But some of the reviews here are a bit unfair. It's like reviewing McDonalds and complaining it's not the best burger of your life. This place is the McDonald's of wings with beer.  It's good for what it is. The service is friendly and both times we've gone there in the past month the manager comes around asking if everything is ok. Nice touch. The limited time Asian sauce is a good one and the relatively new mango habanero is really tasty. Somehow the bill always surprises me-as though I feel like I am getting ripped off for what I'm getting-but the place has little control over that. All in all, if you live in the area, this may be your only option for a variety of sauces from which to choose and if you keep in mind that this is the McDonald's of wings and beer it's not half bad."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"I give this place a very happy three stars. 

Got the lunch special 12 boneless wings, fries,  and carrots for $10. 

It's a bit steep for a lunch but it the boneless chicken wings were very good,  did not get a bite of tendon or mystery crunch such as you would from other boneless chicken wings. 

They let me choose as many flavors as I wanted so I settled for garlic parmesan,  Caribbean jerk,  and mango habanero.

All the flavors covered the wings very generously and were very finger-lickin good!  I loved how they really meant Hot when they marked the mango habanero - No weak sauce here!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.

It's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"So here to catch lunch. Sit at bar.  Not real busy at all.  Order wings...thats what they do right??? Two guys at bar get their BURGERS before my wings come!   Never been a big fan of this place and another reason not to be, besides being over priced."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"Worst B Dub's ever........

So it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.

It gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.

By this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  

As we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.

I called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.

I'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"Whomever said this is the McDonalds of wings was spot on.

No the service isn't five star. No the food isn't five star. Yes it is a chain restaurant. Yes the staff are likely minimum wage with lots of turnover. TV's and music too loud even on the patio which is next to a parking lot but they did turn it down when asked. 

To the rest of the folks writing reviews I say ...what exactly were you expecting...?

We go about twice per month and I usually have the BBQ Chicken salad and my wife has the street tacos with shrimp substituted in.  Not five star but consistently pretty good, definitely a bigger salad than I can eat.  Annoying that they charge you 60 cents for an extra dressing. Servers are hit-n-miss but overall about what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  They are quick to right a mistake with 25 percent off or a free entrée if it wasn't what you ordered. 

For example, I ordered a large beer and the keg ran out leaving about 1 inch at the top of the glass that normally would have had beer.  I didn't think much of it but a few minutes later after they swapped the keg out came another large beer to make up for the first.  Never had to ask nor did I expect it.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service.

I signed up for the blazin-rewards program a while back and this location, on more than one occasion, banks the points from customers that pay after you until (I think) someone else in the rewards program bumps you from the queue.  This turned into a free medium sized wings for us ($15) and I also used a survey credit ($5) on the same bill.  Lunch for the two of us that day was $8 including tip.

So lighten up, go eat something and enjoy the ice-cold beer."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"To be quite honest with you, I think Buffalo Wild Wings is overrated. My boyfriend and I have been here twice, but there's nothing special about it compared to any other place.

My boyfriend prefers the wings here, compared to those at Pizza Hut that we usually get, but it's actually vice versa for me. For me, the BBQ sauce on the wings I got here tasted the same as what I can get at Pizza Hut. So why PAY more for less at B-Dubs when I can GET more for less at Pizza Hut?

The cheese curds, fried pickles, and shrimp tacos are good, but the appetizers are vastly overpriced. You get an extremely small order for the price of what should be enough for two people. It's just not worth it. Furthermore, out of all the desserts here, I've only tried the fried cheesecake bites and they weren't good at all. The texture was strange and the flavor was lacking.

Overall, I don't think I'll be going here anymore."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"I prefer this  Buffalo Wild Wings  location over the Fitchburg location as there tends to be less little kids having loud birthday party's here. 
The buffalo ranch chicken wrap is always tasty as are the soft pretzels. 
Good food at a fair price."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"I love buffalo wild wings  food, but their service everywhere in the madison area lacks significantly."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"This is by far the best Buffalo Wild Wings in Madison! You can always count on their food being just what you expected, where as other locations are hit or miss. The service is always pretty decent. They have many T.V's so you can watch a game or follow multiple games. They also offer trivia, which is sometimes fun to play if your going to be there for a few hours. Tuesdays is 45 cent wing night and Thursday is 60 cent (Can't remember how much?) boneless wing night. They offer Coke products which makes me sad, but I can get over it, because their wings are soooo good. My favorite sauces: Medium and Asian Zing!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"I like to think I have a pretty good eye for restaurants - simply eyeballing a place will usually tell me roughly how good it's going to be.  I eyeballed this place and my intuition told me: BAD.  Or at least generic.  Big sports bar, cheesy gimmicks, giant TV's, overly perky waitresses, a huge meandering menu, and empty tables everywhere.  

But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.

Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!

My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.

Were I ever to be in Monona, WI again (somewhat unlikely) I would come back."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"In short: a standard wings place. Lots of sauces, lots of chicken, lots of TVs. However, both their food and service was better than the downtown location. Our server was great and ridiculously ninja-like: refills would appear and empty dishes would disappear, bills would show up only to disappear and reappear with change, all without anyone at our table of five noticing. 

It gets three stars because it's nothing special, but if it was a world of chains and average food everywhere, it'd get five."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large boneless wings,"Worst wings ever. I ordered boneless wings and a beer. The sauce on the wings was  applied unevenly. The wings themselves were horribly hard, dried out little nuggets that were completely unappetizing. The beer was flat and it wasn't even a full pour which appeared to be because the beer was warm and flat. Like other viewers I experienced awful after effects from the food which must be due to poor hygiene in the kitchen - I can only imagine. BWW will not be getting return business from me."

The fact that we didn't even complain and that they realized their own mistake and made up for it when we were practically oblivious to the situation really impressed me. I work in an office close by to this BWW and will definitely make sure to give them more business in the future because of this. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food itself isn't anything special, but that being said I do enjoy their wings more than most places!"

Buffalo Wild Wings,medium traditional wings,"Just sort of average for your typical chain restaurant but good enough to scratch the itch.

I had the grilled chicken ""buffalitos"" which were actually pretty good.  It was 2 soft shell tacos filled with grilled chicken, lettuce, pico and a sauce of your choice.  I do like their choice of bbq sauces and always choose at least medium hot to combat the typical flavorless food often served to the masses.  It comes with chips and salsa which worked for me.

They offer alternate sides including a veggie boat which is just raw carrots and celery with a $.45 up charge.  C'mon guys, you can do better than that.  Give us some cooked green beans or steamed broccoli and skip the up charge, it's just veggies.

Finally, this place is LOUD with all the TVs going on.  We virtually had to shout at our waiter.  Conversation at the table wasn't too bad since we were close to each other.  Still they could back off on this ""ambiance"" for a better dining experience.

We ended up here because it is what the group chose.  Definitely not the worst choice but I don't see just the two of us choosing to eat here on our own."

Actually, the mixed drinks can be pretty good. Better yet, avoid the food and toss a few back at the bar instead."
Buffalo Wild Wings,medium traditional wings,Not a fan. Quaker steak wings are better. To each their own. Never been impressed with the wings. Watching a game with the guys is good time with some drinks but the food quality is always subpar at best.
Buffalo Wild Wings,medium traditional wings,"I went a few weeks ago to meet girlfriends for drinks and dinner. The service was great to start but as we we're waiting for people our waitress stopped coming by. We could barely flag her down and then she passed us off to another waitress. The next waitress was better. The food was good for a chain. I had the naked tenders with Parmesan garlic.

Buffalo Wild Wings is what it is. It is an ok place to meet people and play trivia and drink. I only go to chains when other people choose them. I'd give it a 2.5 but since the second waitress was better and the food was pretty good I can give it a 3."
Buffalo Wild Wings,medium traditional wings,"We went to Buff' Wild Wings to watch the UFC fights... Not for the food. The food was edible. This said I had no expectations that the food would be phenomenal. We ordered opinion rings - they were OK, predictably bland. Wings, three flavors, so-so. One would think that the wings would be a standout - but not unexpected. We also had a loaded potato skin-esque thing. It was the best thing we ordered. The celery was good - nice crunch. 

Look this place met my entertainment expectations. We didn't go for the food and I wouldn't go for the food... But if you are looking for a place that is going to reliably have the UFC pay per views - Buff Wild Wings will meet this expectation."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"Went for wings last night.  It is a wing joint, after all.  Ordered our wings extra, super crispy.  Like 30 minutes later, they bring out rubbery chicken skin wings.  We sent them back.  Manager came over, and had the NERVE to tell us ""that's why I order boneless wings"".  Really?  You manage a wing joint, and you don't even eat chicken wings?  Boneless wings are NOT wings.  They are chicken breast.
So, after ANOTHER freaking 30 minutes, they bring out our ""new"" wings.  Yup, you guessed it!!  RUBBERY SKIN WINGS!!  I told our waitress, ""bring the bill for the sodas"".
So, we sat there for a damn HOUR, and they never actually got our freaking order right.  We left without eating.  They need to fire their cooks, and get someone in there that is smart enough to touch the wing, and know it's not crispy!! 
And, 7 freaking dollars for two sodas!!!  
It's funny too, cause on the way out, there is a sign on the door that says ""Come hungry, leave triumphant"".  HA!  B*llsh*t!
It will be a cold day in hell before we go back there!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"The last time my husband and I went to this location our service was horrible. We sat in the bar section and the waiter we had was not attentive at all. Than we sat there waiting to give our order and we had to go to the bar to ask for our waiter to come back. He was more interested in the bigger groups in the area than us and the other smaller tables. 

We are also very unhappy with the fact that the sizes for the wings have changed but the prices have not. So now you get five wings for the price you would have gotten six. Very unhappy with that. We love Buffalo Wild Wings but don't like the changes that have been made!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"I met 2 friends here last weekend. My first time as I usually don't go to chain restaurants. We ordered 4 different appetizers: 12 wings, o-rings, garlic mushroom and a flat bread.  The flat bread was good as were the shrooms. The wings were mediocre at best (was surprised by this considering this IS their business)., dry and not great sauces. We each had 2 drinks and the cost came to $35.00 each. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I wasted my money on nothing. The server was incompetent. She actually told us that if we needed her, just wave our hands. HA! Long wait for food, long wait for the bill. Not a place I'd ever go to again. Ick!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"Look-the Madison/Monona area is hard up for a good wing place and BW3 is not going to solve that problem anytime soon. But some of the reviews here are a bit unfair. It's like reviewing McDonalds and complaining it's not the best burger of your life. This place is the McDonald's of wings with beer.  It's good for what it is. The service is friendly and both times we've gone there in the past month the manager comes around asking if everything is ok. Nice touch. The limited time Asian sauce is a good one and the relatively new mango habanero is really tasty. Somehow the bill always surprises me-as though I feel like I am getting ripped off for what I'm getting-but the place has little control over that. All in all, if you live in the area, this may be your only option for a variety of sauces from which to choose and if you keep in mind that this is the McDonald's of wings and beer it's not half bad."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"I give this place a very happy three stars. 

Got the lunch special 12 boneless wings, fries,  and carrots for $10. 

It's a bit steep for a lunch but it the boneless chicken wings were very good,  did not get a bite of tendon or mystery crunch such as you would from other boneless chicken wings. 

They let me choose as many flavors as I wanted so I settled for garlic parmesan,  Caribbean jerk,  and mango habanero.

All the flavors covered the wings very generously and were very finger-lickin good!  I loved how they really meant Hot when they marked the mango habanero - No weak sauce here!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.

It's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"So here to catch lunch. Sit at bar.  Not real busy at all.  Order wings...thats what they do right??? Two guys at bar get their BURGERS before my wings come!   Never been a big fan of this place and another reason not to be, besides being over priced."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"Worst B Dub's ever........

So it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.

It gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.

By this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  

As we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.

I called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.

I'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"Whomever said this is the McDonalds of wings was spot on.

No the service isn't five star. No the food isn't five star. Yes it is a chain restaurant. Yes the staff are likely minimum wage with lots of turnover. TV's and music too loud even on the patio which is next to a parking lot but they did turn it down when asked. 

To the rest of the folks writing reviews I say ...what exactly were you expecting...?

We go about twice per month and I usually have the BBQ Chicken salad and my wife has the street tacos with shrimp substituted in.  Not five star but consistently pretty good, definitely a bigger salad than I can eat.  Annoying that they charge you 60 cents for an extra dressing. Servers are hit-n-miss but overall about what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  They are quick to right a mistake with 25 percent off or a free entrée if it wasn't what you ordered. 

For example, I ordered a large beer and the keg ran out leaving about 1 inch at the top of the glass that normally would have had beer.  I didn't think much of it but a few minutes later after they swapped the keg out came another large beer to make up for the first.  Never had to ask nor did I expect it.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service.

I signed up for the blazin-rewards program a while back and this location, on more than one occasion, banks the points from customers that pay after you until (I think) someone else in the rewards program bumps you from the queue.  This turned into a free medium sized wings for us ($15) and I also used a survey credit ($5) on the same bill.  Lunch for the two of us that day was $8 including tip.

So lighten up, go eat something and enjoy the ice-cold beer."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"To be quite honest with you, I think Buffalo Wild Wings is overrated. My boyfriend and I have been here twice, but there's nothing special about it compared to any other place.

My boyfriend prefers the wings here, compared to those at Pizza Hut that we usually get, but it's actually vice versa for me. For me, the BBQ sauce on the wings I got here tasted the same as what I can get at Pizza Hut. So why PAY more for less at B-Dubs when I can GET more for less at Pizza Hut?

The cheese curds, fried pickles, and shrimp tacos are good, but the appetizers are vastly overpriced. You get an extremely small order for the price of what should be enough for two people. It's just not worth it. Furthermore, out of all the desserts here, I've only tried the fried cheesecake bites and they weren't good at all. The texture was strange and the flavor was lacking.

Overall, I don't think I'll be going here anymore."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"I prefer this  Buffalo Wild Wings  location over the Fitchburg location as there tends to be less little kids having loud birthday party's here. 
The buffalo ranch chicken wrap is always tasty as are the soft pretzels. 
Good food at a fair price."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"I love buffalo wild wings  food, but their service everywhere in the madison area lacks significantly."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"This is by far the best Buffalo Wild Wings in Madison! You can always count on their food being just what you expected, where as other locations are hit or miss. The service is always pretty decent. They have many T.V's so you can watch a game or follow multiple games. They also offer trivia, which is sometimes fun to play if your going to be there for a few hours. Tuesdays is 45 cent wing night and Thursday is 60 cent (Can't remember how much?) boneless wing night. They offer Coke products which makes me sad, but I can get over it, because their wings are soooo good. My favorite sauces: Medium and Asian Zing!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"I like to think I have a pretty good eye for restaurants - simply eyeballing a place will usually tell me roughly how good it's going to be.  I eyeballed this place and my intuition told me: BAD.  Or at least generic.  Big sports bar, cheesy gimmicks, giant TV's, overly perky waitresses, a huge meandering menu, and empty tables everywhere.  

But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.

Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!

My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.

Were I ever to be in Monona, WI again (somewhat unlikely) I would come back."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"In short: a standard wings place. Lots of sauces, lots of chicken, lots of TVs. However, both their food and service was better than the downtown location. Our server was great and ridiculously ninja-like: refills would appear and empty dishes would disappear, bills would show up only to disappear and reappear with change, all without anyone at our table of five noticing. 

It gets three stars because it's nothing special, but if it was a world of chains and average food everywhere, it'd get five."
Buffalo Wild Wings,large traditional wings,"Worst wings ever. I ordered boneless wings and a beer. The sauce on the wings was  applied unevenly. The wings themselves were horribly hard, dried out little nuggets that were completely unappetizing. The beer was flat and it wasn't even a full pour which appeared to be because the beer was warm and flat. Like other viewers I experienced awful after effects from the food which must be due to poor hygiene in the kitchen - I can only imagine. BWW will not be getting return business from me."

She also said that because of their mistake they would be giving us 25% off of our bill. Our server then also apologized multiple times.

The fact that we didn't even complain and that they realized their own mistake and made up for it when we were practically oblivious to the situation really impressed me. I work in an office close by to this BWW and will definitely make sure to give them more business in the future because of this.

Buffalo Wild Wings is what it is. It is an ok place to meet people and play trivia and drink. I only go to chains when other people choose them. I'd give it a 2.5 but since the second waitress was better and the food was pretty good I can give it a 3."
Buffalo Wild Wings,kid's boneless wings,"We went to Buff' Wild Wings to watch the UFC fights... Not for the food. The food was edible. This said I had no expectations that the food would be phenomenal. We ordered opinion rings - they were OK, predictably bland. Wings, three flavors, so-so. One would think that the wings would be a standout - but not unexpected. We also had a loaded potato skin-esque thing. It was the best thing we ordered. The celery was good - nice crunch. 

Look this place met my entertainment expectations. We didn't go for the food and I wouldn't go for the food... But if you are looking for a place that is going to reliably have the UFC pay per views - Buff Wild Wings will meet this expectation."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"Went for wings last night.  It is a wing joint, after all.  Ordered our wings extra, super crispy.  Like 30 minutes later, they bring out rubbery chicken skin wings.  We sent them back.  Manager came over, and had the NERVE to tell us ""that's why I order boneless wings"".  Really?  You manage a wing joint, and you don't even eat chicken wings?  Boneless wings are NOT wings.  They are chicken breast.
So, after ANOTHER freaking 30 minutes, they bring out our ""new"" wings.  Yup, you guessed it!!  RUBBERY SKIN WINGS!!  I told our waitress, ""bring the bill for the sodas"".
So, we sat there for a damn HOUR, and they never actually got our freaking order right.  We left without eating.  They need to fire their cooks, and get someone in there that is smart enough to touch the wing, and know it's not crispy!! 
And, 7 freaking dollars for two sodas!!!  
It's funny too, cause on the way out, there is a sign on the door that says ""Come hungry, leave triumphant"".  HA!  B*llsh*t!
It will be a cold day in hell before we go back there!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"The last time my husband and I went to this location our service was horrible. We sat in the bar section and the waiter we had was not attentive at all. Than we sat there waiting to give our order and we had to go to the bar to ask for our waiter to come back. He was more interested in the bigger groups in the area than us and the other smaller tables. 

We are also very unhappy with the fact that the sizes for the wings have changed but the prices have not. So now you get five wings for the price you would have gotten six. Very unhappy with that. We love Buffalo Wild Wings but don't like the changes that have been made!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"I met 2 friends here last weekend. My first time as I usually don't go to chain restaurants. We ordered 4 different appetizers: 12 wings, o-rings, garlic mushroom and a flat bread.  The flat bread was good as were the shrooms. The wings were mediocre at best (was surprised by this considering this IS their business)., dry and not great sauces. We each had 2 drinks and the cost came to $35.00 each. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I wasted my money on nothing. The server was incompetent. She actually told us that if we needed her, just wave our hands. HA! Long wait for food, long wait for the bill. Not a place I'd ever go to again. Ick!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"Look-the Madison/Monona area is hard up for a good wing place and BW3 is not going to solve that problem anytime soon. But some of the reviews here are a bit unfair. It's like reviewing McDonalds and complaining it's not the best burger of your life. This place is the McDonald's of wings with beer.  It's good for what it is. The service is friendly and both times we've gone there in the past month the manager comes around asking if everything is ok. Nice touch. The limited time Asian sauce is a good one and the relatively new mango habanero is really tasty. Somehow the bill always surprises me-as though I feel like I am getting ripped off for what I'm getting-but the place has little control over that. All in all, if you live in the area, this may be your only option for a variety of sauces from which to choose and if you keep in mind that this is the McDonald's of wings and beer it's not half bad."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"I give this place a very happy three stars. 

Got the lunch special 12 boneless wings, fries,  and carrots for $10. 

It's a bit steep for a lunch but it the boneless chicken wings were very good,  did not get a bite of tendon or mystery crunch such as you would from other boneless chicken wings. 

They let me choose as many flavors as I wanted so I settled for garlic parmesan,  Caribbean jerk,  and mango habanero.

All the flavors covered the wings very generously and were very finger-lickin good!  I loved how they really meant Hot when they marked the mango habanero - No weak sauce here!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.

It's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"So here to catch lunch. Sit at bar.  Not real busy at all.  Order wings...thats what they do right??? Two guys at bar get their BURGERS before my wings come!   Never been a big fan of this place and another reason not to be, besides being over priced."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"Worst B Dub's ever........

So it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.

It gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.

By this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  

As we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.

I called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.

I'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"Whomever said this is the McDonalds of wings was spot on.

No the service isn't five star. No the food isn't five star. Yes it is a chain restaurant. Yes the staff are likely minimum wage with lots of turnover. TV's and music too loud even on the patio which is next to a parking lot but they did turn it down when asked. 

To the rest of the folks writing reviews I say ...what exactly were you expecting...?

We go about twice per month and I usually have the BBQ Chicken salad and my wife has the street tacos with shrimp substituted in.  Not five star but consistently pretty good, definitely a bigger salad than I can eat.  Annoying that they charge you 60 cents for an extra dressing. Servers are hit-n-miss but overall about what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  They are quick to right a mistake with 25 percent off or a free entrée if it wasn't what you ordered. 

For example, I ordered a large beer and the keg ran out leaving about 1 inch at the top of the glass that normally would have had beer.  I didn't think much of it but a few minutes later after they swapped the keg out came another large beer to make up for the first.  Never had to ask nor did I expect it.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service.

I signed up for the blazin-rewards program a while back and this location, on more than one occasion, banks the points from customers that pay after you until (I think) someone else in the rewards program bumps you from the queue.  This turned into a free medium sized wings for us ($15) and I also used a survey credit ($5) on the same bill.  Lunch for the two of us that day was $8 including tip.

So lighten up, go eat something and enjoy the ice-cold beer."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"To be quite honest with you, I think Buffalo Wild Wings is overrated. My boyfriend and I have been here twice, but there's nothing special about it compared to any other place.

My boyfriend prefers the wings here, compared to those at Pizza Hut that we usually get, but it's actually vice versa for me. For me, the BBQ sauce on the wings I got here tasted the same as what I can get at Pizza Hut. So why PAY more for less at B-Dubs when I can GET more for less at Pizza Hut?

The cheese curds, fried pickles, and shrimp tacos are good, but the appetizers are vastly overpriced. You get an extremely small order for the price of what should be enough for two people. It's just not worth it. Furthermore, out of all the desserts here, I've only tried the fried cheesecake bites and they weren't good at all. The texture was strange and the flavor was lacking.

Overall, I don't think I'll be going here anymore."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"I prefer this  Buffalo Wild Wings  location over the Fitchburg location as there tends to be less little kids having loud birthday party's here. 
The buffalo ranch chicken wrap is always tasty as are the soft pretzels. 
Good food at a fair price."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"I love buffalo wild wings  food, but their service everywhere in the madison area lacks significantly."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"This is by far the best Buffalo Wild Wings in Madison! You can always count on their food being just what you expected, where as other locations are hit or miss. The service is always pretty decent. They have many T.V's so you can watch a game or follow multiple games. They also offer trivia, which is sometimes fun to play if your going to be there for a few hours. Tuesdays is 45 cent wing night and Thursday is 60 cent (Can't remember how much?) boneless wing night. They offer Coke products which makes me sad, but I can get over it, because their wings are soooo good. My favorite sauces: Medium and Asian Zing!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"I like to think I have a pretty good eye for restaurants - simply eyeballing a place will usually tell me roughly how good it's going to be.  I eyeballed this place and my intuition told me: BAD.  Or at least generic.  Big sports bar, cheesy gimmicks, giant TV's, overly perky waitresses, a huge meandering menu, and empty tables everywhere.  

But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.

Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!

My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.

Were I ever to be in Monona, WI again (somewhat unlikely) I would come back."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"In short: a standard wings place. Lots of sauces, lots of chicken, lots of TVs. However, both their food and service was better than the downtown location. Our server was great and ridiculously ninja-like: refills would appear and empty dishes would disappear, bills would show up only to disappear and reappear with change, all without anyone at our table of five noticing. 

It gets three stars because it's nothing special, but if it was a world of chains and average food everywhere, it'd get five."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"Worst wings ever. I ordered boneless wings and a beer. The sauce on the wings was  applied unevenly. The wings themselves were horribly hard, dried out little nuggets that were completely unappetizing. The beer was flat and it wasn't even a full pour which appeared to be because the beer was warm and flat. Like other viewers I experienced awful after effects from the food which must be due to poor hygiene in the kitchen - I can only imagine. BWW will not be getting return business from me."

The fact that we didn't even complain and that they realized their own mistake and made up for it when we were practically oblivious to the situation really impressed me. I work in an office close by to this BWW and will definitely make sure to give them more business in the future because of this. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food itself isn't anything special, but that being said I do enjoy their wings more than most places!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,"Yikes. An atrocious sports bar with 3,000 flat panel TVs, and a laminated menu book. 

If you must go here, and don't have time to hang yourself before, stick to the bone-in wings, avoid the useless sauces at all cost, and order lots of drinks to numb the pain.

Actually, the mixed drinks can be pretty good. Better yet, avoid the food and toss a few back at the bar instead."
Buffalo Wild Wings,small traditional wings,Not a fan. Quaker steak wings are better. To each their own. Never been impressed with the wings. Watching a game with the guys is good time with some drinks but the food quality is always subpar at best.

Buffalo Wild Wings,medium boneless wings,"Just sort of average for your typical chain restaurant but good enough to scratch the itch.

I had the grilled chicken ""buffalitos"" which were actually pretty good.  It was 2 soft shell tacos filled with grilled chicken, lettuce, pico and a sauce of your choice.  I do like their choice of bbq sauces and always choose at least medium hot to combat the typical flavorless food often served to the masses.  It comes with chips and salsa which worked for me.

They offer alternate sides including a veggie boat which is just raw carrots and celery with a $.45 up charge.  C'mon guys, you can do better than that.  Give us some cooked green beans or steamed broccoli and skip the up charge, it's just veggies.

Finally, this place is LOUD with all the TVs going on.  We virtually had to shout at our waiter.  Conversation at the table wasn't too bad since we were close to each other.  Still they could back off on this ""ambiance"" for a better dining experience.

We ended up here because it is what the group chose.  Definitely not the worst choice but I don't see just the two of us choosing to eat here on our own."

The next waitress was better. The food was good for a chain. I had the naked tenders with Parmesan garlic.

Buffalo Wild Wings is what it is. It is an ok place to meet people and play trivia and drink. I only go to chains when other people choose them. I'd give it a 2.5 but since the second waitress was better and the food was pretty good I can give it a 3."
Buffalo Wild Wings,medium boneless wings,"We went to Buff' Wild Wings to watch the UFC fights... Not for the food. The food was edible. This said I had no expectations that the food would be phenomenal. We ordered opinion rings - they were OK, predictably bland. Wings, three flavors, so-so. One would think that the wings would be a standout - but not unexpected. We also had a loaded potato skin-esque thing. It was the best thing we ordered. The celery was good - nice crunch. 

Look this place met my entertainment expectations. We didn't go for the food and I wouldn't go for the food... But if you are looking for a place that is going to reliably have the UFC pay per views - Buff Wild Wings will meet this expectation."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"Went for wings last night.  It is a wing joint, after all.  Ordered our wings extra, super crispy.  Like 30 minutes later, they bring out rubbery chicken skin wings.  We sent them back.  Manager came over, and had the NERVE to tell us ""that's why I order boneless wings"".  Really?  You manage a wing joint, and you don't even eat chicken wings?  Boneless wings are NOT wings.  They are chicken breast.
So, after ANOTHER freaking 30 minutes, they bring out our ""new"" wings.  Yup, you guessed it!!  RUBBERY SKIN WINGS!!  I told our waitress, ""bring the bill for the sodas"".
So, we sat there for a damn HOUR, and they never actually got our freaking order right.  We left without eating.  They need to fire their cooks, and get someone in there that is smart enough to touch the wing, and know it's not crispy!! 
And, 7 freaking dollars for two sodas!!!  
It's funny too, cause on the way out, there is a sign on the door that says ""Come hungry, leave triumphant"".  HA!  B*llsh*t!
It will be a cold day in hell before we go back there!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"The last time my husband and I went to this location our service was horrible. We sat in the bar section and the waiter we had was not attentive at all. Than we sat there waiting to give our order and we had to go to the bar to ask for our waiter to come back. He was more interested in the bigger groups in the area than us and the other smaller tables. 

We are also very unhappy with the fact that the sizes for the wings have changed but the prices have not. So now you get five wings for the price you would have gotten six. Very unhappy with that. We love Buffalo Wild Wings but don't like the changes that have been made!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"I met 2 friends here last weekend. My first time as I usually don't go to chain restaurants. We ordered 4 different appetizers: 12 wings, o-rings, garlic mushroom and a flat bread.  The flat bread was good as were the shrooms. The wings were mediocre at best (was surprised by this considering this IS their business)., dry and not great sauces. We each had 2 drinks and the cost came to $35.00 each. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I wasted my money on nothing. The server was incompetent. She actually told us that if we needed her, just wave our hands. HA! Long wait for food, long wait for the bill. Not a place I'd ever go to again. Ick!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"Look-the Madison/Monona area is hard up for a good wing place and BW3 is not going to solve that problem anytime soon. But some of the reviews here are a bit unfair. It's like reviewing McDonalds and complaining it's not the best burger of your life. This place is the McDonald's of wings with beer.  It's good for what it is. The service is friendly and both times we've gone there in the past month the manager comes around asking if everything is ok. Nice touch. The limited time Asian sauce is a good one and the relatively new mango habanero is really tasty. Somehow the bill always surprises me-as though I feel like I am getting ripped off for what I'm getting-but the place has little control over that. All in all, if you live in the area, this may be your only option for a variety of sauces from which to choose and if you keep in mind that this is the McDonald's of wings and beer it's not half bad."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"I give this place a very happy three stars. 

Got the lunch special 12 boneless wings, fries,  and carrots for $10. 

It's a bit steep for a lunch but it the boneless chicken wings were very good,  did not get a bite of tendon or mystery crunch such as you would from other boneless chicken wings. 

They let me choose as many flavors as I wanted so I settled for garlic parmesan,  Caribbean jerk,  and mango habanero.

All the flavors covered the wings very generously and were very finger-lickin good!  I loved how they really meant Hot when they marked the mango habanero - No weak sauce here!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"I keep coming back here every three months or so, and each time it's worse. Ordered a snack of 5 wings, and two were just embarrassingly scrawny. Overpriced, long wait, drinks never refilled, marginal service.

It's me. It is. I'm an idiot for coming back here. [slapping self]. Stupid, stupid, stupid!!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"So here to catch lunch. Sit at bar.  Not real busy at all.  Order wings...thats what they do right??? Two guys at bar get their BURGERS before my wings come!   Never been a big fan of this place and another reason not to be, besides being over priced."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"Worst B Dub's ever........

So it began when the guy at the host counter sat us all the way in the back of the restaraunt.  Not a big deal usually, but this trip to B dub was to get my buddy out of the house.  He had a broken pelvis and could barely walk.  He had to hobble past several empty tables while he was put on display for all of the partons and staff to see.  There was an empty table right next to the door.  Why couldn't we be seated there.  Piss poor customer service.

It gets worse.  After what seemed to be an eternity. our order showed up.  No plates, utencils, just a bowl full of wings.  When we asked for plates and utincels, the waitress scouled and shook her head in discust.  Wow, excellent example of how to treat your guests.

By this time, we had enough.  We asked to see the manager, who came over and blew off the fact they made a crippled man walk across the restaraunt (took 5 minutes) to be seated, and then he made excuses as to why his staff was angry.  Then he offered to reduce the bill, but when the bill came we were charged full price.  

As we left, none of the staff offered to help my buddy with the door.  As I pulled the car up for him, I noticed him fighting with the door and his walker, while the staff stood at the host desk and watched.  What a bunch of d-bags.

I called in to the restaraunt after we left and asked to speak to the general manager.  He was out, but was assured he would return the call.  7 days later still no word.  Dear Mr. GM, here's your Yelp review.  Choke on it.  Not that you give a turkey anyway.

I'd rather lick the floor of a KFC than visit this B Dub ever again."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"Whomever said this is the McDonalds of wings was spot on.

No the service isn't five star. No the food isn't five star. Yes it is a chain restaurant. Yes the staff are likely minimum wage with lots of turnover. TV's and music too loud even on the patio which is next to a parking lot but they did turn it down when asked. 

To the rest of the folks writing reviews I say ...what exactly were you expecting...?

We go about twice per month and I usually have the BBQ Chicken salad and my wife has the street tacos with shrimp substituted in.  Not five star but consistently pretty good, definitely a bigger salad than I can eat.  Annoying that they charge you 60 cents for an extra dressing. Servers are hit-n-miss but overall about what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  They are quick to right a mistake with 25 percent off or a free entrée if it wasn't what you ordered. 

For example, I ordered a large beer and the keg ran out leaving about 1 inch at the top of the glass that normally would have had beer.  I didn't think much of it but a few minutes later after they swapped the keg out came another large beer to make up for the first.  Never had to ask nor did I expect it.  I'd say that's pretty good customer service.

I signed up for the blazin-rewards program a while back and this location, on more than one occasion, banks the points from customers that pay after you until (I think) someone else in the rewards program bumps you from the queue.  This turned into a free medium sized wings for us ($15) and I also used a survey credit ($5) on the same bill.  Lunch for the two of us that day was $8 including tip.

So lighten up, go eat something and enjoy the ice-cold beer."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"To be quite honest with you, I think Buffalo Wild Wings is overrated. My boyfriend and I have been here twice, but there's nothing special about it compared to any other place.

My boyfriend prefers the wings here, compared to those at Pizza Hut that we usually get, but it's actually vice versa for me. For me, the BBQ sauce on the wings I got here tasted the same as what I can get at Pizza Hut. So why PAY more for less at B-Dubs when I can GET more for less at Pizza Hut?

The cheese curds, fried pickles, and shrimp tacos are good, but the appetizers are vastly overpriced. You get an extremely small order for the price of what should be enough for two people. It's just not worth it. Furthermore, out of all the desserts here, I've only tried the fried cheesecake bites and they weren't good at all. The texture was strange and the flavor was lacking.

Overall, I don't think I'll be going here anymore."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"I prefer this  Buffalo Wild Wings  location over the Fitchburg location as there tends to be less little kids having loud birthday party's here. 
The buffalo ranch chicken wrap is always tasty as are the soft pretzels. 
Good food at a fair price."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"I love buffalo wild wings  food, but their service everywhere in the madison area lacks significantly."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"This is by far the best Buffalo Wild Wings in Madison! You can always count on their food being just what you expected, where as other locations are hit or miss. The service is always pretty decent. They have many T.V's so you can watch a game or follow multiple games. They also offer trivia, which is sometimes fun to play if your going to be there for a few hours. Tuesdays is 45 cent wing night and Thursday is 60 cent (Can't remember how much?) boneless wing night. They offer Coke products which makes me sad, but I can get over it, because their wings are soooo good. My favorite sauces: Medium and Asian Zing!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"I like to think I have a pretty good eye for restaurants - simply eyeballing a place will usually tell me roughly how good it's going to be.  I eyeballed this place and my intuition told me: BAD.  Or at least generic.  Big sports bar, cheesy gimmicks, giant TV's, overly perky waitresses, a huge meandering menu, and empty tables everywhere.  

But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.

Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!

My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.

Were I ever to be in Monona, WI again (somewhat unlikely) I would come back."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"In short: a standard wings place. Lots of sauces, lots of chicken, lots of TVs. However, both their food and service was better than the downtown location. Our server was great and ridiculously ninja-like: refills would appear and empty dishes would disappear, bills would show up only to disappear and reappear with change, all without anyone at our table of five noticing. 

It gets three stars because it's nothing special, but if it was a world of chains and average food everywhere, it'd get five."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"Worst wings ever. I ordered boneless wings and a beer. The sauce on the wings was  applied unevenly. The wings themselves were horribly hard, dried out little nuggets that were completely unappetizing. The beer was flat and it wasn't even a full pour which appeared to be because the beer was warm and flat. Like other viewers I experienced awful after effects from the food which must be due to poor hygiene in the kitchen - I can only imagine. BWW will not be getting return business from me."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"There isn't much that stands out from this particular Buffalo Wild Wings compared to others I have been to aside from the service we received at this location. Our server was very friendly and helpful the entire time, however it turns out that he made a mistake and forgot to put our order in. My husband and I noticed it was taking a while but didn't mention it to anybody working there. We just figured it was a busy afternoon. When they realized the mistake they made the manager came up to our table and explained the situation and apologized. She also said that because of their mistake they would be giving us 25% off of our bill. Our server then also apologized multiple times.

The fact that we didn't even complain and that they realized their own mistake and made up for it when we were practically oblivious to the situation really impressed me. I work in an office close by to this BWW and will definitely make sure to give them more business in the future because of this. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food itself isn't anything special, but that being said I do enjoy their wings more than most places!"
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,"Yikes. An atrocious sports bar with 3,000 flat panel TVs, and a laminated menu book. 

If you must go here, and don't have time to hang yourself before, stick to the bone-in wings, avoid the useless sauces at all cost, and order lots of drinks to numb the pain.

Actually, the mixed drinks can be pretty good. Better yet, avoid the food and toss a few back at the bar instead."
Buffalo Wild Wings,traditional and boneless wings combo,Not a fan. Quaker steak wings are better. To each their own. Never been impressed with the wings. Watching a game with the guys is good time with some drinks but the food quality is always subpar at best.

One would think that the wings would be a standout - but not unexpected. We also had a loaded potato skin-esque thing. It was the best thing we ordered. The celery was good - nice crunch. 

Look this place met my entertainment expectations. We didn't go for the food and I wouldn't go for the food... But if you are looking for a place that is going to reliably have the UFC pay per views - Buff Wild Wings will meet this expectation."
Chili's,1/2 rack original baby back ribs,"Had a great dinner: baby back ribs (always great), fajitas (sizzling good), & fish tacos (family favorite). Nate was an attentive & kind server."
Chili's,1/2 rack original baby back ribs,"Okay, before you write me off or send an angry mob with pitchforks to chase me off of yelp, remember this review is solely based on MY experience with the food 'I' ordered. 

First, I groaned at the suggestion of eating at the lower-tiered chain. Sadly their reputation proceeded them. However, my disdain quickly vanished.

I ordered the Grilled Fish Tacos:
3 tacos with grilled chile-lime tilapia topped with house-made cilantro slaw, pico de gallo, sliced avocado, chopped cilantro & queso fresco wrapped. Substituted the rice and beans with a side fresco salad and quinoa and wheatberry salad.

When I opened my box, I was surprised to see how fresh and colorful everything appeared. The side salad was a nice mix of baby greens. The lime vinaigrette that came with the salad was refreshingly and light. Not overly oily at all. The Quinoa and wheatberry salad arrived warm. It had delightful balance of diced red peppers and sauteed onions that dressed up super-grains, and gave it a flavorful zest.

The fish tacos were amazing! They softly sat atop of what appeared to be wheat flour tortillas on a bed of fresh shredded cabbage - not coleslaw (this is very important to note, as there have been other offenders), drizzeled with pica de gallo and piled with generous slabs of ripe green avocados. The sauce was hiding underneath. 

Visually, this was not what I expected out of Chili's. Slapped on a colorful bold platter, and could have passed in any other established Mexican restaurant.

They were so tasty! The tilapia was well seasoned and brought out the entire flavor of the tacos, complimenting the otherwise unadventurous cabbage. It tasted fresh, not a hint of fishyness at all. 

Another thing I love about Chili's, sure some people may associate it as junk food or think of high sodium-inducing coma, but you can customize the meal to as healthy or as unhealthy as you want it to be.

For example, you can go with the Bacon Ranch Beef Quesadillas, topping at a whopping 1,800 calories with a sides of Mac and Cheese, which are an additional 490 calories. Or instead, you can choose the Fish Tacos (820 calories for all three!) with a Quinoa and wheatberry blend (a mere 130 calories), and still have enough room - calorically speaking - left for dessert, and not feel guilty about it.

I'm just so thrilled I was able to have a great meal at Chili's!"
Chili's,1/2 rack original baby back ribs,"Chili's....it is what it is, and my review reflects this....

We typically come here at least 3 or 4 times a year, at least one time being for a birthday party and ribs.  They have ALWAYS treated us well, the food is decent, service is friendly, the the Chili's experience is perfect for a fun, bit loud, and silly birthday party.  The staff are fun, and oh-so-patient.  Hint...free brownie-ice cream treat on birthdays and with movie ticket stubs.  DANGER...sweet but, hard to resist.

The other times we're here it's for lunch during errands.  We usually sit at a hi-top in the bar to avoid the wait.  The waits can be long during peak periods but, they handle them well.  It's a fun place to watch games, good visibility of televisions in the bar and they're really nice about switching channels.  I've always had decent service here, too.

The food...the food is Chili's.  It's not fine dining, and not meant to be.  It's a hell of a lot better than Perkins or Red Robin.  They do a nice Tex-Mex/American blend menu, with a lot of good healthy choice options.  They're also not afraid to do tangy, hot, and flavorful.  If you can't find something you like on the huge menu, you're just too darn picky and don't go out to eat with me.

My only complaint is the place can be dirty.  To be fair, that's a bit inevitable with such a popular and busy location.  The staff do run around cleaning and are attentive but, on more than one occasion, I've had a dirty booth or table.  So, for that, 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give them 4.5 if it was an option."

Chili's,dinner for 2,"My family and I were seated immediately, but that was the only timely thing that happened. After seating us and being greeted by the waiter, fifteen minutes went by before we saw him again to order our drinks. The entire night the service was terrible; the waiter only stopping by to drop off our drinks and food. Our dinner took an additional thirty minutes after the drinks came. We got our appetizer after dinner (still paid for it though). One of my friends was seated near us, after we arrived, but got their food and finished it before we even got ours.

With no apologies or explanations, I'm left thinking this is the norm and have no desire to go back to find out."

Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"When in the Madison area, one can never go wrong dining at Takara. It is hard to find decent sushi restaurants in the state of WI yet Takara is truly an exception. The fish and sushi preparation has shown consistent quality and preparation the 4+ years I have been frequenting. The appetizers are all delicious and appealing , the sushi is fresh and rolled tight, and the fried rice is perfectly prepared with vegetables meat of choice and that delicious hibachi smokey flavor. Whether I order as take out or dine in the quality is always consistent. The only complaint is that the service is very slow, even if you are one of two tables in the restaurant, in which case you will have to politely remind the server to remember your drinks etc. When I do dine at Takara I always order from their online menu ( I use my smart phone to look it up ) as the variety of rolls is greater than the printed menus."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"We stopped by as a party of 6 for a birthday dinner. The experience was interesting and sub-par. 

The Food - Out of everything the food was probably the only thing that went right. Salmon was fresh, avocado was fresh, fish to rice ratio was good. Although there weren't too many signature rolls to chose from. Rolls had different names, but everything was pretty much the same, nothing special. 

Rolls ordered

Rainbow Roll - Average 
Salmon Avocado - Generous with their salmon, avocado was fresh
House Special Roll (forgot the name) - Wrapped in white seaweed, first time trying that. The roll had 3 types of fish on the inside hamachi, salmon, and tuna. Interesting roll, tasted great. 

Pricing - Average pricing 8-13 per roll, again just wish they had more rolls to chose from. 

Service - Service was interesting, our first waiter was clueless about our menu. Our second waiter forgot about a cup of tea we ordered with our entrees and appetizers. Along with that he even forgot about an order of appetizers. When the bill came we asked for split bills, that came back immediately. But then we were left in the corner we sat in, no one ever came to take our bills. After 10 minutes of attempting to get the attention of our server we just decided to go up to the cashier and pay ourselves. The cashier took about 10 minutes to finalize 5 bills. In total, we waited 20 minutes to pay and leave; horrible service. 

In all 
Service was horrible.
Sushi was fresh. 
Reasonable pricing. 
Not enough variety of rolls

Probably won't be back again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I ordered delivery from here and we were very happy with the meal!  The sushi was very tasty and my 10-yr-old sister gobbled up her adult-portion of noodles.  We also ordered edamame and seaweed salad, both of which were served just the way we liked it.

A note about the delivery:  First, they were fast!  (I hate waiting for food and appreciate this!)  Second, they separated the hot and the cold food.  How great is that??  One bag for the sushi and seaweed salad and another for the noodles and edamame.  Super helpful since we weren't eating it right away.  We will order from here again!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I've been to Takara many times in the past, and ordered takeout recently only to be disappointed.  As far as I'm concerned, their entrees and cooked dishes are far better than their sushi.  The soba noodles are delicious, the sushi, not so much.  I ordered a Naruto and an Iso fantastic roll, both of which were gigantic.  I don't think you should have to cut a piece of sushi into pieces just to be able to eat it, but with the rolls at Takara, you do.  The fish seemed semi fresh, and the rice was well cooked, but both the rolls I ordered at least 3 inches in diameter and had an inch layer thick of rice, which made them hard to eat.  One positive thing I will say is that their house ginger dressing is amazing, and I'd recommend the house salad.  Overall, I really used to like this place, but my most recent experience was a bit sub par.  Skip the sushi and go for the entrees."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,I'm from L.A. and know what a great sushi is.  I went here while on a business trip from the reviews on Yelp. Takara far exceeded my expectations.  I had I had the Unagi bowl and some sushi.  Taste was excellent and presentation is exceptional!  I will be coming here every time I come to Madison.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Went there for the first time in a few years and had a wonderful lunch. Great sushi and fast service.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Sushi in Madison, WI.? Really. Color me skeptical.
OK, perhaps I'm a bit of a Minneapolis snob. Minneapolis,  you know, the birthplace of sushi, the home of sushi, where sushi was invented, where sushi is prepared with fish caught from our very own ocean.
But Madison? Well, color me impressed.
Tasty, fresh sushi beautifully presented.
The server-by-committee left a few holes at times, but had its own charm at the same time. 
All in all, a nice meal. If my daughter chooses the school with the red and white badger, I look forward to eating here again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Three and a half--Perfectly good sushi and rolls for a reasonable price.  My faves are the spicy tuna and eel and avocado rolls.  Takara is a frequent lunch destination for me and buddies from work--we prefer the State Street location because it seems to be a bit quieter than the one on Whitney Way.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara is very uneven.  Sometimes the food is very good.  Other times the service is surly and unpleasant.  At times, late in the evening, it is noisy with lots of loud drinking games.  The last time we were there we were so disappointed we have not been back.  Better sushi in other places in Madison.  And better treatment of customers (in my view)"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"WORST SUSHI EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!  I have been to Takara 3 times.  The first two were average.  This last time was horrific.  I ordered the Crab roll, 2 spicy tuna rolls, and the eastern roll and the rice was extremely dry and hard in ALL of my rolls.  It was so hard that I could hear crunching sounds in my head as I chewed my sushi.  I told the waiter and the manager and they just said ""that's how sushi is supposed to be.""  They did not make any adjustments to my bill nor did they offer a replacement.  POOR FOOD AND POOR SERVICE!!!  I'm never coming back again.  Go to Sushi Muramoto instead!!  Their service never disappoints."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Second best sushi in Madison.  Best lunch and best sushi downtown.  The bento boxes are such a great deal I take anyone visiting Madison to lunch there.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I love sushi and tar tar, so raw is not a problem.  The delivery from this place took and hour, which could be improved, but not my primary concern.  The three rolls that I had with crunch, were a bit soggy and certainly not crunchy.  More importantly the philly roll I ordered was horrible.  It was inedible.  The salmon was so tough it felt more like I was chewing on a carrot and my gag reflexes started to kick in.  I would advise against ordering here if you enjoy well made fresh sushi."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I found this place on Yelp. I was meeting up with a group of friends, all our first time in Madison. Their reviews look reasonably pleasant. I have to say that I am disappointed. 

Their menu choices are very limited with only about 10 special rolls, some of which have way too similar style. We ordered their sashimi appetizer and 4 special rolls. The sashimi was decent, with one of the sashimi being artificial crab sticks. Really? You call that sashimi? 

The rolls turned out to be pretty reasonable but if you have lots of artificial crab meat, you cannot really go wrong can you? There are definitely way better sushi places out there. There were also very few people in the restaurant for the entire hour we were there, which was regular dinner time on a Thursday. It clearly did not reflect their 4 star rating on Yelp. Their service was also just so-so as we did not get a water refill until we were mostly done with our meal. Nope, don't think I will be visiting this place again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I came here for my birthday. I chose this spot because they have sushi boats. Overall great environment, decent sushi, good service, and fair prices."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,This place gets 3 stars for having so-so entrees and sushi that is pricier than more up-scale sushi restaurants downtown.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Of all the places in Jersey who would think that Madison has excellent sushi?  But low and behold Takara really does have excellent sushi.  I have tried numerous specialty rolls and have been pleased again and again.  The fish is fresh, the rolls are creative, and the staff aims to please here.  It's definitely pricier than other sushi joints in the area, but you get what you pay for."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I  have been going here for years.. YEARS!!  It was the only place I go, but something has changed.  No more friendly staff, you get people who will try to push you off the phone or just flat out lie to you about their store hours.  Oh and I am only talking about the downtown location.   This is after I had to complain about the Chirashi, because they were adding more decorative veggies, than actual fish.  I ended up going to the west side location for that, but now I think I will make the full transfer.  Maybe it's just time to look for a new Sushi place.."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I have never actually had one of the meals at Takara because when I go here I'm interested in sushi and that's it.  Takara never disappoints.  They have fabulous service and well crafted sushi rolls.  My favorites include the Fancy Salmon Roll, Naruto, and Fashion Maki.  You definitely have options for sushi in Madison and going here is a good choice"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Went there with some friends who had the hibachi which looked okay. I just had sashimi which was very underwhelming. Have had much better elsewhere.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara is the reason I love sushi and crave it on a weekly basis.

I used to be skeptical of sushi and didn't think I could ever love raw fish...but now, I'm one of the biggest fans. Whenever I am in Madison, it is imperative that my boyfriend and I have at least one meal at Takara. Their edamame is steamed and salted perfectly and their Spicy Tuna and Spice Salmon rolls always leave me wanting to order more - the rolls are the perfect size... I just never want the bites to end! I have tried 4-5 of their specialty rolls but none of them are as memorable as the Spicy Tuna and Salmon -- but are still great! 

My boyfriend loooves Nigiri and always orders this when we come here. I too like Nigiri but I prefer the rolls. But seeing the satisfaction on his face as he eats each piece will make anyone want to order ""what that guys having"". 

The service can be slow when its swamped on a Friday or Saturday night at the peak times...but thats expected of any restaurant in Madison at that time. However, when we have gone during the week or a Sunday night, the service is great and the servers are extremely nice. 

The only reason I did not give Takara 5 stars is because I have not found any of the specialty rolls to be memorable and crave worthy, but the Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon fill that void - for now! I have not given up on finding that roll....  

I love Takara and definitely would recommend it to everyone who wants a good, affordable sushi meal. Can't wait to try the Love Boat!!!  (which yes... my boyfriend and i have considered ordering to ourselves because Takara is that great)."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Food - Quality of food is so much better here than at the Whitney Way location, special sushi rolls were almost as good as ones I've had in LA or NY, hibachi came with 2 delicious sauces and the shrimp/steak/chicken were full of flavor

Price - 2 of us spent about 90$ for 2 hibachi and 2 special sushi rolls, tips included, for dinner. Can be pricey if you're into steak or seafood hibachi

Service - Great hibachi cook, put on a knife and fire show for us and had us leaning backwards to avoid getting burnt from the nice surprise he had for us. Waiters were generally pretty responsive to our needs

Pros - Quality of sushi rolls, especially the special rolls, are definitely above average. What made me give this 4 stars instead of 3 though is the hibachi grill and the chef that prepared it for us. Very entertaining and the food that came out of it was delish

Cons - Almost none, a bit pricey for dinners.

Overall - Definitely try the hibachi if you have a chance, I've had it elsewhere but the chef who prepares it here at Takara is one of a kind"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This place was super tasty! I'm originally from California, so it's hard to find good sushi in Wisconsin. Found this place on Yelp when I had a sushi craving, and I was not disappointed! Dropped by around dinner time on a Saturday and was served quite quickly. We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer (was so-so), but the real treat was the sushi boat I ordered. I wasn't a fan of much of the rolls on the original Sushi ""Love"" Boat on the menu, so I asked if I can order a bunch of rolls and hand rolls I like and put it on a sushi boat. They did it. A+ service. Would recommend. Would return."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I am giving this restaurant 4 stars rather than 5 solely because I have never actually stepped foot inside the building - I have just ordered sushi from them on the regular for about 3 months now! Their delivery is fast, their sushi is well made and fresh.  You can get fancy rolls and they are good, but the stand bys (salmon chirashi! yuuuuum) are great and fresh.  Also it is really easy to order online for delivery.  As a true sushi fan who would eat sushi everyday if I could,  I appreciate these things!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Had lunch there yesterday.  We ordered the salmon sushi and salmon roll.  Both were excellent, but the sushi was a little pricey at $2.50 a piece.
We also had the chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura bento box.
the chicken was a disappointment.  Not much teriyaki sauce and was accompanied by wilted sprouts.  Shrimp tempura was very good but only got 2 pieces of shrimp.  there was lots of veggie tempura to go along with it though.  
Bento box also comes with california roll (pretty good) and an excellent mashed potato breaded katsu.  this was the highlight of the bento box.  The miso soup was average.  I personally don't like seaweed in my soup but others may disagree.  
The service was ok.  It took a while to remove plates and the staff all seemed a bit disgruntled.  After only one visit, the highlight seems to be the sushi.  We will go back, but won't be ordering the teriyaki."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"The first Japanese restaurant I visited in Madison, and I sticked to only Takara until now. Their service is just fine, but two of their sushi rolls are my favorite! Try Romantic Roll and Fancy Salmon Roll. Yummmmmmmm. And their dessert: Fried Cheesecake, this I cannot find elsewhere! Crispy on the outside, filled with half-frozen cheese inside. Nyum.

,Also, do not sit on the chairs, but take off your shoes and sit down on the upper floor, it's fun!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Best sushi in Madison for a very reasonable price. Great for sitting in or taking out.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"We ate here last weekend.  We were definitely jonesing for sushi.  Unfortunately, we found it to be only mediocre here.  After  a couple ""okay"" pieces of salmon, I tried the tuna and it was stringy/chewy.  It actually took about 20 seconds to  get it to the point where I could swallow it.  A second piece was similar.  A couple more and I started to lose interest.  Atmosphere and staff were nice, but wouldn't go again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I started living in Madison in 2004 and at that point had NEVER had sushi before.  I would watch others eat and just say that it wasn't appealing to me.  It was at Takara that I converted.  

In the height of my Takara days, I would go here 2 or 3 times a week.  The food is always consistent and tasty.  Never had a bad bite.  I was told by my Japanese roommate that Wasabi (down the street a few blocks) is a bit more authentic as to what one would get in Japan, but that there was nothing awry with Takara either.

It continues to be THAT place for me that I go when I crave sushi.  The ambience is classy and I especially like the trickling waterfall in the front.  The staff has worked there for many years and they are always professional and quick.  It is a favorite for birthdays and special dinners!!!  I especially like the orange flavored chocolate dessert option."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I LOVE Takara! For being in the Midwest their fish is incredibly fresh. I have never had a bad meal here. I always get their spicy tuna roll, by far the best in Madison! Bento boxes for lunch are great, as is their hibachi."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I went there once, and I'm really satisfied with the overall.

The Bento Special, which i ordered, is in good portion and it tastes just fine. But the Sashimi it serves inside the Bento Special is really really tasteful. I've also order the baby Tako, and it tastes just right. I also ordered the spicy spider roll, it is okay only. Due to tight budget, I didn't order more Sashimi, but you got to try."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,We went here for sushi. The waiter was pretty unfriendly and inattentive. Sushi was okay- not rolled well. Shrimp tempura had little flavor to it. Also the rolls are pretty small for the price. I think we'll go elsewhere for sushi next time.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I write this review with the full disclosure that I am not very sushi-savvy.  I was visiting Madison for business recently and was encouraged to check out Takara, so I figured I'd take this colleague up on the recommendation.  I went on a Saturday evening with a group of 7 -- note: for groups of this size, reservations are not a bad idea.  We were able to be seated within about 10 minutes for sushi, but especially if you want a hibachi table, there might be a wait.  My group ordered a variety of rolls, ranging from around $4-8 each.  I ordered the spicy tempura roll, and my inner-wannabe-sushi-eater was pleased.  Super tasty and simple enough to understand as a sushi novice.  Beyond that, the environment was fun and definitely busy, which reflects good quality food. Service was so-so -- our waiter was friendly, but we definitely had empty drink glasses for long periods of time; now that I think of it, I never did get the water refill I requested -- which can be uncomfortable when you accidentally eat way more wasabi than intended.  All in all, A-OK and worth checking out on future visits."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"First, Takara is definitely worth a second visit, but the sushi just wasn't incredible. I mean they do have some cool plates, but the rolls weren't as clean tasting as I would have liked them to be.

If you are looking for good sushi in Madison, I hope that this isn't the best it has to offer but it very well may be. If that is the case you should stick to the standard tuna and salmon first and venture off of those with a critical eye. The unagi just doesn't seem right also, but it is decent."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Nothing like a record breaking protest for democracy in Wisconsin to test the relative abilities of the restaurants near the capitol to handle big crowds.  Takara did much better than most, they managed to squeeze us in within a couple of minutes, and overall, the service was polite, quick, attentive, and competent, by American standards.  By Japanese standards, they were a little rude, no welcome (""irasshaimase""), or oshibori (hot towel to wash up with), or hot tea (ocha). On the way out, polite Japanese waitstaff always thank you (maido arigato!"", or at least just, maido""!, if it's busy)"".  Not here. 
      A note for those of you who are trying to make sense of the rather wide range of ratings from the Yelpers here, the prices are a bargain for sushi if you're from out of town, but by Madison grad student standards, this is an expensive dinner; compared to sushi prices for Madison area Japanese and pseudo-Japanese restaurants, this place is about average.  Yes, the staff is Asian, but no, they are most certainly NOT Japanese.  There are various hints, like, for instance, they don't speak Japanese, and the menu has odd mistakes. For example, instead of tonkatsu, they have ""katsu dipping sauce,"" and they provide spoons with the soups (Japanese soup should be eaten by bringing the bowl up to your face with the fingers of both hands), the food isn't always served in the appropriate (according to Japanese manners) bowls or dishes. So, if you're looking for authentic Japanese, you might be a little disappointed, there's this silly ""Hibachi"" open grill set up for entertainment-cum-Japanese-stereotype dinner, that should be avoided.  
     The sushi on the other hand, is pretty good.  They have a good but not great selection of the standard sushi choices, they also have some original and inventive rolls, I liked my ""samurai roll,"" though it was cut in an odd way.  Japanese sushi should be eaten in one bite, so that the beautifully presented piece isn't aesthetically marred on the way in, but the roll I ordered was cut into pieces too large to get into even my big mouth in one bite.  The unagi, tomago, and toro were quite good, the uni was slightly off (I wonder if it was microwave defrosted).  The edamame was fresh and generous in portion size.  You don't automatically get a bowl of miso first, you have to order it separately, although minor, I didn't like that, on a cold day, it's just good Japanese manners to warm your customers up with really hot miso, and if you're ordering a lot of sushi, the cost of ""complimentary"" miso is really negligible.  
     The tempura and katsu were tasty, but not quite right (the batter and frying oil weren't exactly right).  Tempura is a challenge, the texture has to be just so, it needs to taste light and crispy, very hot, not greasy in spite of the fact that it's fried.  If you've had a lot of Japanese food, you'll know what I mean, the tempura and katsu will be a tad disappointing, if you're not so familiar with authentic Japanese, it's not like the Takara versions are not palatable, they're just not exactly correct.  When tempura is done right, the batter is made with icy water, prepared from scratch just before frying in sesame oil.  If shortcuts are taken, a mixture of cheaper oils, batter made up before hand, lukewarm water is used, then the characteristic texture and taste is slightly off even if the rest of the recipe and cooking process is loyal to tradition.  They're taking some sort of similar shortcut with the katsu, as the breading isn't quite Japanese panko, and they don't serve it cut lengthwise the way the Japanese like it, they've invented a kind of nugget variation. 
      The location is very convenient for either the capitol or the UW-Madison campus."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"If Takara was a person I would marry them.  

3 words: Spicy Tuna Roll.  You will never have a better spicy tuna roll than you will get at Takara.  It is like this nugget of pure deliciosity that explodes in your mouth and you are left wondering how you can relive that moment again and again...then you realize you have 5 more little beautiful tastelets sitting on your plate.  Then you realize you have to share them.  And that kids, is how murder happens.  

For real though, this place is great.  It has kind of ruined me for sushi restaurants forever because I love it so much.  Good prices too, I've never spent more than $50 bucks and I order a ridiculous amount of sushi every time I go.  It's a really good place to ease people into trying sushi.  

One side note, the waitresses all wear their kimonos with the obi tied on the front, which is what Japanese prostitutes used to do...so I've always found that really funny while I'm there.  It doesn't have anything to do with the food, but there ya go.  

The downside of the state street one is all the sororities and frats gather there for sake-bombs on the weekends, which is incredibly annoying.  There's another location off Whitney Way if you want to avoid that crap, and the food is just as good."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,My boyfriend and I were in Madison for the day and we had heard good things about Takara. We ordered the sushi for two. The prices were very reasonable and the sushi was absolutely delicious. The service was very good as well. Highly recommended.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara is pretty good, but the sushi is too darn expensive unless you get the lunch special.  The vegetarian teriyaki was OK, but not spectacular."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Excellent lunch specials. Love the Bento Box lunches.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,The sushi was good. The service was okay. The udon was okay. The server was nice but spilled my miso soup. 3 stars
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"safe place for sushi.  great service.  

I saw the sushi chef making this cool boat platter with lots of sushi on it.  I want that next time!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This is the best sushi I have ever had.
Unfortunately, not the best customer service. It wasn't horrible, but after dinner my bf and I agreed that if the service had been a bit better we would have been over the moon happy with Takara. 

That being said....we will still go back time and time again because the sushi was seriously that amazing."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Miso soup was ok, sushi was good, bubble tea was ok . Four stars for the food but two stars only for the  service.
Sushi & rolls presentation - five stars."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,This is my favorite sushi place in Madison. The sushi is fresh and the atmosphere is nice. My favorites are the spicy tuna and the seared tuna appetizer-- it's really unique and has an interesting sauce that it's served with. They have a nice lunch special too where you can choose a salad or soup and several sushi roll choices for a good price!
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara is the best Japanese/Sushi restaurant in Madison easily! If your looking for great sushi at a reasonable price go for the Takara Lunch Special. For two rolls and either soup/salad it is only $9.50 and for three rolls and either soup/salad it is only $12.25, you can not get a whole lot better than that. 

The spicy California roll is by far the best roll available. I have tried getting spicy California rolls at other restaurants since trying theirs and I have never found something that comes even close to Takaras. 

Takara is also a great place to go for Hibachi. I love sitting around the table while the food is cooked in front of us. It is great for special occasions whether you are on a date or with a group of friends for a birthday."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Been once, and only for the sushi.  The sushi and veg. tempura are good and reasonably priced.  The only reason I'm reviewing Takara is for their spicy tuna roll.  I've been to a lot of different sushi places with a lot of people who love this roll and I want to like it but it always ends up tasting like whatever spicy sauce they use and nothing else.  I'm a fan of spice, but I'm also a fan of tuna.  I'm also a fan of tasting things other than a questionable sauce for the rest of the meal.  I'm not averse to spice, I just don't want it to overpower my tongue for the next few minutes.  

This is where Takara shines.  Their spicy tuna roll actually tastes both good and like spicy tuna.  It is not overpowering, is a pleasant taste rather than just chili oil, and is a welcome addition to any sushi platter.

As others have noted, the crowds are a turn-off and you would probably be better off at wasabi or edo.  Based on food alone though, Takara is just as enjoyable."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. After reading so many reviews, I was  having a  high hope to find another good Japanese restaurant in Madison. Sadly the food is very bland, the sushi is not fresh at all. We ordered sushi for two and you can see some of the meat are cooked due to microwave defrosting."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Good sushi, but a little overpriced in my opinion. Also, they don't do brown rice which is kind of annoying. Overall pretty solid sushi joint. Gets busy around 7."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara has a great lunch special with 3 rolls for around 12 dollars. Sushi isnt great in Madison, but Takara has provided a consistent sushi roll and great lunch special."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I probably eat lunch here 2-3 times a month.  Their spicy tuna roll, which I admit is my central criterion for judging Japanese restaurants, is AMAZING--spicy but not killer, not too much mayo, and a generally nice texture with some crunch from tempura bits.  I also really like their vegetable tempura roll with asparagus and sweet potato.

The lunch special is $9.50 for two rolls with soup or salad; $12.50 for three rolls with soup or salad.  They also have very nicely priced bento box meals.  The shrimp tempura seems a little bland to me, but I really like the veggie version.  Shumai and gyoza are also very good here.

I don't do the hibachi thing, but did once sit at the hibachi table when I came in with a large group.  They were very accommodating to us, which didn't surprise me, as service is generally good.

Highly recommended: hot sake with dinner in the winter; green tea with lunch."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I booked a table for 10 last saturday for my mom's b-day. I tried to book for 2:00 but they close for lunch at 2:30 and I changed the rezzo to 1:30. We were all driving in from different places so that's as early as our group could go. 

The staff was extremely attentive and the sushi was really good. And. wow. coming from Chicago...what a steal! All 10 of us ate a hearty lunch (my mom and I got a boat...yes a boat-o-sushi between us) and lots of saki and supporo and the bill was only $245!! 

We also brought cakes for my mom which the staff kept and even decorated with cherries and oranges before bringing them out at around 3:00 with smiles on their faces and a happy, gong accompanied, happy birthday song!

The one star deduction is for the lack of dish clearing throughout the meal. The edaname appetizer remains were sitting there for almost the entire meal. It's a peeve. When I'm done with something please clear it so there is plenty of elbow room especially with a table of 10.

Thank you Takara, for staying late and being great.
The lunch was delish and you helped make my mom's b-day such a lovely day!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"How have I not reviewed this place yet!?  I love sushi...I usually crave it every couple weeks and this is the place to come for satisfaction.  I am never disappointed and there is a lot to watch as everything is made right in front of you.  Takara is also known for its saki bombs, which everyone needs to experience once.  My only complaint is that every time I go in there there seems to be a group of greeks (the fraternity/sorority kind) and they can be a little obnoxious.  It would take more than that to ruin this place though.  Expect to pay about $15-18 a person, but well worth it.  5 stars."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I was pleasantly surprised with the sushi here. I came here at lunchtime and took advantage of the lunch special. I though the tempura was good and fresh. I also thought the rolls were good. Nicely prepared, and good quality fish. The soup was good too. If I have a sushi craving while in Madison, I'd be happy to come here again. It's a good deal at lunch, though I think it was weird this place didn't have tea at lunchtime."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"eh- location is good and the lunch special is cheap ($8 for two rolls and soup or salad), but you could probably do just as well with grocery store rolls. It's usually busy and can be fun for groups for this reason, but don't expect to be impressed- the unique rolls are expensive and the rest are boring and average."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I moved to Madtown from LA a year ago, and I don't know what I'd do without Takara.  In LA, I lived in Little Tokyo, and ate Japanese food at least one meal a day.  So, I would safely say, I'm pretty obsessed w sushi!
This place is better than the other sushi restaurants I've tried in Madison.  (I like Muramoto's restaurants a lot, but they are more like fusion food, and the menus seem kinda limited, and very pricey.)
Anyway, these are my faves from Takara:
Naruto roll:  this is so great because it's rolled in cucumber, and is spicy tuna w no rice.  It's delicious and seems extra healthy, which I appreciate.
Tataki (tuna or beef): seared tuna or steak sliced very thin and served w ponzu (citrus soy sauce).  We always order one of each.  The portion is small but the taste is delicious!  I would eat ten orders of this if I could do so without feeling humiliated!
Special king crab roll:  this is real crab w different colors of caviar (masago, tobiko, etc) on the outside.  How can you go wrong w crab & caviar?!
spinach: I forget what Takara calls it, but it's goma-ai (spinach w sesame sauce)
I've not tried the teppanyaki side of the restaurant, but the chefs over there do the cute entertaining stuff, so that might be a fun place to take a family for a birthday dinner.
It's a good restaurant!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Went for lunch and had the Sushi Lunch where you get four rolls, chef's choice and those blasted California rolls. Overall, incredibly average. I've had better, I've had worse. The chef's sushi selection was decent for the usual suspects, tuna, salmon, mackerel sort of thing. As in, he didn't go out of his way to thrill me. The rice was okay. Consistency was off, little mushy as if it had been formed for 30 seconds too long. Otherwise, I had a pretty good lunch for a very reasonable price. The sushi isn't good enough to eat alone , so bring some good company along and you won't notice."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I love visiting this sushi bar when I'm in the Madison area. The staff is really nice, the sushi chefs are friendly and funny, and the food is delicious. Try the Badger roll - you won't be disappointed! :D"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Takara has lots of menu options to try. Hibachi grill is a great way to introduce the family to a sushi house. I love to sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare the rolls myself. Some entertain while you drink saki and eat sashimi.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara and Ginza are my favorite sushi places in Madison. I can't speak for Takara's other dishes, just the sushi. They have a spicy tuna roll that's wrapped in cucumber instead of rice - fantastic. I've also gotten the ""love boat"" before, which is a huge boat filled with chefs choice. All very delicious."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Madison and has been for years.  Yes, I've tried Sushi Box.  No, I don't care that the sushi is more 'authentic,' and therefore, 'better.'  I love my Americanized maki!  Put some more avocado and cream cheese on that shit!  ;)

Seriously, though, I am a big fan of their sushi rolls.  I particularly like the Shogun Roll and Spicy Tuna.  I love that their menu says ""Special Roll for Special Customer.""  :D  They have an excellent lunch special, if I'm remembering correctly.  Their entrees are good, too.

I really enjoy the atmosphere (usually quiet, even if there are lots of people), and the service (friendly, attentive and polite).  

One day, out of nowhere (and much to my chagrin), a roach crawled up on my table!  Nothing could've blown my mind more, because this place just looks so clean!  I alerted a waitress, who FREAKED out.  She and several other waitresses had a small shit fit and managed to capture the roach and get rid of it.  They apologized profusely and were so embarrassed.  I am *positive* that the roach mosied on over from the ultra-scuzzy Pizza Di Roma next door.  Still, it's worth mentioning, just in case they really do have roaches.  :)  I'd still go back, though!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"California Roll and Spicy Spider sushi was very good! Also ordered Yaki udon, the WORST udon noodles I've ever had!! They were completely mushy and the vegetables had an acrid taste. Told the waiter immediately to take it away that I did not like it--STILL CHARGED ME FULL PRICE!!! They get 2 stars for sushi, I do NOT recommend."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Outstanding service, nice interior, disappointing food. The tempura was greasy and tasted as though the oil in the fryer hadn't been changed in a while. The sushi was ice cold, a dead giveaway that it wasn't freshly prepared. Prices are reasonable given the amount of food, but don't expect great quality, at least not at lunch."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Sushi was good, not great. The location is great and the hibachi grills are always fun for groups."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,We've been coming to Takara for years - best sushi in town with a friendly staff.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"My favourite sushi/ sashimi place in town. They definitely have the best selection of sushi, which regularly serving rare treats like mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) and toro. I won't say their cooked food and sometimes the sushi are really top notch, but considering we are in madison and faraway from any japanese settlement, I consider they do a pretty good job"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING!!  Udon, sushi, and HIBACHI!  Seating at sushi bar, regular tables, habachi bar, and on the floor Japanese cushioned seated tables.  All quite good.  And chefs of all ethnicities... so multicultural, this place has it all.

Pros: cheaper and better tasting that Muramoto, also more Asian people, the lunch special
Cons: stains on plating, sticky tables, a lot of oil in hibachi"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I really like their sushi. The rice is of the right consistency and flavour, the fish is tasty and fresh, and it is the only place where I have had conch and sea urchin."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I came to give this place a second chance, and I shouldn't have done so. The service was terrible! I made reservations to sit at the hibachi grill and upon being seated, my boyfriend and I were seated at the back of the grill that was filled by a group of 10. (We basically looked at the backside of the chef). That being said, we didn't get to see anything the chef was doing while cooking our food. Furthermore, our waitress asked our order at the beginning of the night, yet never returned to ask for refills on drinks etc.  The appetizer sushi roll or ordered came right as dinner was being served. I'm very upset with the lack of service that we received at this establishment. I will not be returning and hope that those that brace this place don't experience the poor service that o received."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Took my good friend Sara here on a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area. 

I couldn't be happier with the experience we had. The edamame was excellent, the vegetable tempura was amazing and the hibachi was very good. 

We walked in hungry and left full and very pleased. 

The service was excellent as well.

Can't wait to come back to mad-town and try some of their sushi!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"The lunch sets are a good deal and habachi display is cool.  I find this place too expensive,especially after another Japanese restaurant called Osaka opened a few blocks away which offers a variety of sushi and bento box for a more reasonable price,quality is a little inferior of course but well worth your money."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Had a terrific dinner here while visiting Madison.  I really enjoyed my sushi, and my wife had a great Bento Box."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Vegetable tempura was enjoyable, and the rolls that came with vegetable sushi entree that contained fried vegetables were very tasty. Otherwise, I thought the food was just ok. I ordered a salad and it was dressing with a little bit of lettuce. Good service and it was fun to watch the sushi chefs perform their art."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 

Shame on me. I went here twice. Big big mistake. Well, not that big, since it's reasonably priced, but damn, I could have gotten better sushi from the grocery store. 

I went here three years ago. I don't at all recall what I got. It was likely something on the sushi spectrum. I recall a vague mental note-to-self saying ""don't go to that place again"". 

I went here earlier this week and kept it simple: a California roll and a spicy tuna. C'mon, who could make these things unpleasant? They're usually so good, so dependable. While they were certainly edible, they weren't *good*. The spicy tuna maki was a gelatinous blob surrounded by rice and the California roll did was much too heavy on the mayonnaise and much too light on the avocado. I really did not find either to be worthwhile. I did, however, try some of my friend's tempura bento box, which had some nicely done tempura-ed vegetables. 

Overall, it wasn't all bad. The service was a little too eager, but very polite and attentive, which is refreshing."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Was it the best sushi I've ever had? No. Will I be back anyways? Yes. 

Came here with a friend last night (Thursday) after failing to get a table at Red. The ambiance is what you'd expect at a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant. A little tacky but it works. Our service was fine and pretty quick. A little less than half of the restaurant was full so that was probably part of the reason. 

Their house wine was not very good. I know I should expect that when paying $4 for a glass of wine, but I've had better for the same price. However our rolls were delicious. Between the two of us we had the spicy tuna roll, shogun roll and salmon and avocado roll. Everything was fresh and tasted very good. We finished it all within about 15 minutes!

I noticed they also do hibachi, I'll be anxious to try that next time I'm in.

Overall, a fine place to go for some reasonably priced sushi and/or Japanese food. I will be back!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"If you're a sushi enthusiast like myself, then this is the place for you.

The sushi is extremely fresh and well made. The prices are reasonable, ranging anywhere from ~$4 for basic rolls to ~$12 for fancier ones. 2 orders will definitely fill you up, so I recommend bringing a few friends and ordering a couple to share amongst yourselves. 

You can't really go wrong with any of the sushi, but I personally liked the Naruto, Philadelphia Roll and Fashion Maki.

If you're not in the mood for sushi, they also offer a wide selection of hibachi. Now keep in mind that the hibachi comes with salad, soup and rice, so only order it if you're really, really hungry. Also, it's doused in soy sauce, so if that's not your jam, request less sauce. 

The service is a bit slow (roughly 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the party), but the food is definitely worth it.

I will definitely be frequenting this place quite often. 

PS: They also offer sake bombs!!111shiftone!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I've eaten here for lunch before and the service was reasonable. For some reason, arriving close to 6pm on a Friday night yielded really subpar service - and the food took over 40 minutes to arrive.   

The salmon bento box was nicely grilled.  Shumai dumplings that go with the bento could be much improved.  The tempura was nicely done."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I really should give up on sushi in Madison. I really miss the interesting things people came up with for GOOD vegetarian rolls. Takara only offered the very basic rolls (vegetable tempura, avocado, kampyo, nato, cucumber) and my whole meal was just boring.

And stale.

Derek ordered the Fancy Salmon roll and I ordered the vegetable tempura. It seems like a sushi roll that has been deep fried in tempura batter couldn't mess up, but both of ours were stale. I bit into mine and could barely chomp through. HOW ROMANTIC. We just went there last night and I don't remember anything else we got.

Our waiter and waitress were pretty awkward and shy, and obviously not interested in us at all. No smiles, all business. I did see them smile when the 4 girls there to begin their friend's 21st birthday party got crazy during the Happy Birthday song. They actually were the only thing making me smile (besides my fiance across from me) because they did seem so happy to be sake bombing.  It made me want to re-celebrate my 21st birthday!

So, yeah, I wouldn't bother again. I think if we want sushi here, we'll go to Wasabi next time."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,Good sushi with a reasonable price. Takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Ordered some rolls to go for lunch. Per my online order receipt, I ordered tekka and sake, but ended up a sake and alaskan roll instead. Didn't notice it until I was already back at the office. I'm not a fan of wasabi being in a regular sake roll, either. Even if it is more ""authentic,"" I'd rather it be an option on the side. Overall, wasn't terrible sushi, but the cheaper, more ""express"" places around campus seem to offer the same taste/quality, so I'll probably choose them for a quick sushi fix in the future."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Sushi here was really good, go for the crunchy shrimp. The Katsu Don was average, not anything special. Restaurant is owned chinese people, not authentic Japanese."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This place was good, and I enjoyed my meal here. I had the edamame, ginger salad, and a sushi combo of spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy california rolls. 

The rolls were pretty good; I like to dip my sushi into more spicy mayo, and I think I'd come back for this combo again. It wasn't anything spectacular or special that I would die to try again, but I enjoyed it. The salad was just a little off to me. The greens were drowned in a thick garlic sauce, and I saw myself digging to find lettuce that wasn't covered in it. I did not enjoy the salad, so I think I'll ask for the soup next time.

The restaurant looked pretty small, but the environment was cute and cozy. I liked hearing the chefs in the background cooking. Overall, I can see myself enjoying this place with a large group of people if we sat in the back with the flat stove top."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"The sushi here is great! It's fresh and compared to the other sushi restaurant on State St they actually make it correctly and worth the money it is on the menu.

The wait are friendly but they seem generally disinterested. Of course they also sat me at the sushi bar were they pick up the sushi orders and I kept having to lean out of the way for them to get food. Also, of the three people on staff for the wait staff were taking turns sitting in the far corner rolling utensils while the third answered the phones and generally ignored the patrons in the restaurant. However, I do appreciate the not overly attentive staff compared to some other sushi restaurants I've been to. 

Overall I think I'll be going here more often to see if it's any different the second time, but I wasn't overly impress with my first visit."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I can always count on Takara to deliver good, quick, and affordable sushi!

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a california roll, and the calamari appetizer. My husband and I both agreed that we should have skipped the calamari and got another roll. Our friends got spicy salmon & a rainbow roll & they loved their selections as well.

Surprisingly good: the old fashioned. My husband ordered it as a bit of a joke (not expecting a great old fashioned at a Japanese restaurant), but he was happy with it. We've definitely had worse!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Visited my sister this weekend and we were really looking forward to getting sushi at Red. We walked in and there was a 1 1/2 hour wait and we were starving so we decided to go to Takara instead. Bad idea, first off, we were sat next to the fountain and it smelled so bad, like a dirty fish tank. The edamame was decent, some of it had gone brown, but tasted alright. We got a spicy tuna roll and some specialty roll, the tuna roll had some ""brownage""going on which kinda worried us, but we were starving so we ate it, definitely not great sushi by any means. All we cared about was not getting food poisoning. We lucked out, felt fine the rest of the evening, but our clothes wreaked of a cheap China Buffett the rest of the night out, barf! So overall, never would I go to this place again!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I've eaten at a few hibachi spots and I have to say this one just might have topped them all. Go figure! In Madison, of all places.

The man and I were the only two sitting at the grill and we were surprised to find that the chef still went above and beyond despite only having us as an audience. He was definitely determined to get that onion volcano going even though we didn't really care if he did or not since we've seen it a million times. But after 4 or 5 times, he finally got it. He was very entertaining and his jokes were cheesy but made us laugh. Spinning an egg on the grill and calling it an ""egg roll?"" Ha-ha!

The portion of the food was ginormous for the both of us. The vegetables themselves seemed like it could've been split to more than 2 portions. We ordered the filet mignon, shrimp, salmon, and chicken....all of which we dipped in the amaaaaaaazing seafood sauce. And the chef even gave us extra before he left.

The only thing we didn't like was that it was $2.95 for fried rice. Eh? I guess I'm used to it being included back home in L.A. Oh well.

Love the hibachi experience here. Haven't tried the sushi yet. One day!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Decent, but not great, sushi and sashimi. Price is fair for a Japanese restaurant. Would go again if I ever crave Japanese food."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Takara was my introduction to sushi. I never ate in the restaurant, but my roommate** and I ordered take-out quite a lot. My favorite thing was to bring sushi up to Concerts on the Square in the summer. 

For those who are also getting their sushi education at Takara, I highly recommend their veggie tempura roll. I would still order that today, even now that I will eat practically any fish, raw or cooked (my education was expedited when I worked at a sushi bar after college).

Hibachi will cost you, but Takara is really cheap for sushi. It didn't seem like it on a student's budget, I know. To put it in perspective, In Minneapolis (which isn't even an expensive city), a big specialty roll can run close to $20 -- at Takara, nothing is over $14. Their two- or three-roll lunch specials... I don't even wanna talk about it. Be thankful, Madison. Damned thankful.

**My college roommate could eat wasabi by the handful."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Just had lunch at Takara and I was thoroughly impressed. I'm from out of town and needed a great sushi place close to campus. Slim chance, right?  WRONG!  

Starts with great ambiance. Traditional Japanese art and design concepts. Very soothing. Excellent lunch specials too. 3 delicious rolls for under $15!  Try the Alaska, spicy tuna, and tuna & salmon rolls. Very fresh, good presentation. 

Highly recommend for anyone on the UW campus or in Madison."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I took my girlfriend here for lunch and I found hair in my salad and our sushi was bland.. we got five different rolls to split and none of them had very much flavor... even the two spicy rolls we got weren't spicy at all.. It was really disappointing.. It wasn't worth paying 40 dollars for, I've had better sushi from the grocery store"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi and sashimi lunch,"My wife and I went here tonight after previously going to Takara's other location on the west side of town. Both times, I have walked away pretty impressed with the sushi there.

Full disclosure: I am by NO means a sushi connoisseur, or even someone who knows much about sushi. When we go out for sushi, my wife usually just orders a variety of rolls and I sample everything.

However, I have eaten at a handful of different sushi joints, and Takara has consistently been one of the better ones I've sampled. The service was blisteringly quick, the drinks were pretty good, and the sushi was excellent. 

We will definitely be back!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"When in the Madison area, one can never go wrong dining at Takara. It is hard to find decent sushi restaurants in the state of WI yet Takara is truly an exception. The fish and sushi preparation has shown consistent quality and preparation the 4+ years I have been frequenting. The appetizers are all delicious and appealing , the sushi is fresh and rolled tight, and the fried rice is perfectly prepared with vegetables meat of choice and that delicious hibachi smokey flavor. Whether I order as take out or dine in the quality is always consistent. The only complaint is that the service is very slow, even if you are one of two tables in the restaurant, in which case you will have to politely remind the server to remember your drinks etc. When I do dine at Takara I always order from their online menu ( I use my smart phone to look it up ) as the variety of rolls is greater than the printed menus."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"We stopped by as a party of 6 for a birthday dinner. The experience was interesting and sub-par. 

The Food - Out of everything the food was probably the only thing that went right. Salmon was fresh, avocado was fresh, fish to rice ratio was good. Although there weren't too many signature rolls to chose from. Rolls had different names, but everything was pretty much the same, nothing special. 

Rolls ordered

Rainbow Roll - Average 
Salmon Avocado - Generous with their salmon, avocado was fresh
House Special Roll (forgot the name) - Wrapped in white seaweed, first time trying that. The roll had 3 types of fish on the inside hamachi, salmon, and tuna. Interesting roll, tasted great. 

Pricing - Average pricing 8-13 per roll, again just wish they had more rolls to chose from. 

Service - Service was interesting, our first waiter was clueless about our menu. Our second waiter forgot about a cup of tea we ordered with our entrees and appetizers. Along with that he even forgot about an order of appetizers. When the bill came we asked for split bills, that came back immediately. But then we were left in the corner we sat in, no one ever came to take our bills. After 10 minutes of attempting to get the attention of our server we just decided to go up to the cashier and pay ourselves. The cashier took about 10 minutes to finalize 5 bills. In total, we waited 20 minutes to pay and leave; horrible service. 

In all 
Service was horrible.
Sushi was fresh. 
Reasonable pricing. 
Not enough variety of rolls

Probably won't be back again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I ordered delivery from here and we were very happy with the meal!  The sushi was very tasty and my 10-yr-old sister gobbled up her adult-portion of noodles.  We also ordered edamame and seaweed salad, both of which were served just the way we liked it.

A note about the delivery:  First, they were fast!  (I hate waiting for food and appreciate this!)  Second, they separated the hot and the cold food.  How great is that??  One bag for the sushi and seaweed salad and another for the noodles and edamame.  Super helpful since we weren't eating it right away.  We will order from here again!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I've been to Takara many times in the past, and ordered takeout recently only to be disappointed.  As far as I'm concerned, their entrees and cooked dishes are far better than their sushi.  The soba noodles are delicious, the sushi, not so much.  I ordered a Naruto and an Iso fantastic roll, both of which were gigantic.  I don't think you should have to cut a piece of sushi into pieces just to be able to eat it, but with the rolls at Takara, you do.  The fish seemed semi fresh, and the rice was well cooked, but both the rolls I ordered at least 3 inches in diameter and had an inch layer thick of rice, which made them hard to eat.  One positive thing I will say is that their house ginger dressing is amazing, and I'd recommend the house salad.  Overall, I really used to like this place, but my most recent experience was a bit sub par.  Skip the sushi and go for the entrees."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,I'm from L.A. and know what a great sushi is.  I went here while on a business trip from the reviews on Yelp. Takara far exceeded my expectations.  I had I had the Unagi bowl and some sushi.  Taste was excellent and presentation is exceptional!  I will be coming here every time I come to Madison.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Went to Takara on a Wednesday night. I was part of a group of four and we had reservations for the hibachi grill. We all ordered cocktails which took a while to arrive, can't quite remember the name of the one we all ordered. It was a fruity cocktail with pineapple and coconut flavors in it. Sweet, but still a fun drink. Appetizers came out promptly, before our drinks. As soon as the hibachi chef came out, that's when the party started. His name was Tio and he is such a crowd-pleaser. He would say silly jokes, and his agility with the grill and food was evident. I ordered the steak and shrimp hibachi. Tio made the fried rice ($2.95 up charge), he grilled the vegetables, and gave us dipping sauces. He then grilled our meat and sea food. My entree dinner was about $20. Not bad for the amount of food I ate. The experience is for sure a fun one, and I would love to go again with a group of people. The hibachi grill is more of a fun social experience and great for larger groups."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,Went there for the first time in a few years and had a wonderful lunch. Great sushi and fast service.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Sushi in Madison, WI.? Really. Color me skeptical.
OK, perhaps I'm a bit of a Minneapolis snob. Minneapolis,  you know, the birthplace of sushi, the home of sushi, where sushi was invented, where sushi is prepared with fish caught from our very own ocean.
But Madison? Well, color me impressed.
Tasty, fresh sushi beautifully presented.
The server-by-committee left a few holes at times, but had its own charm at the same time. 
All in all, a nice meal. If my daughter chooses the school with the red and white badger, I look forward to eating here again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,Three and a half--Perfectly good sushi and rolls for a reasonable price.  My faves are the spicy tuna and eel and avocado rolls.  Takara is a frequent lunch destination for me and buddies from work--we prefer the State Street location because it seems to be a bit quieter than the one on Whitney Way.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara is very uneven.  Sometimes the food is very good.  Other times the service is surly and unpleasant.  At times, late in the evening, it is noisy with lots of loud drinking games.  The last time we were there we were so disappointed we have not been back.  Better sushi in other places in Madison.  And better treatment of customers (in my view)"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"WORST SUSHI EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!  I have been to Takara 3 times.  The first two were average.  This last time was horrific.  I ordered the Crab roll, 2 spicy tuna rolls, and the eastern roll and the rice was extremely dry and hard in ALL of my rolls.  It was so hard that I could hear crunching sounds in my head as I chewed my sushi.  I told the waiter and the manager and they just said ""that's how sushi is supposed to be.""  They did not make any adjustments to my bill nor did they offer a replacement.  POOR FOOD AND POOR SERVICE!!!  I'm never coming back again.  Go to Sushi Muramoto instead!!  Their service never disappoints."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,Second best sushi in Madison.  Best lunch and best sushi downtown.  The bento boxes are such a great deal I take anyone visiting Madison to lunch there.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I love sushi and tar tar, so raw is not a problem.  The delivery from this place took and hour, which could be improved, but not my primary concern.  The three rolls that I had with crunch, were a bit soggy and certainly not crunchy.  More importantly the philly roll I ordered was horrible.  It was inedible.  The salmon was so tough it felt more like I was chewing on a carrot and my gag reflexes started to kick in.  I would advise against ordering here if you enjoy well made fresh sushi."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I found this place on Yelp. I was meeting up with a group of friends, all our first time in Madison. Their reviews look reasonably pleasant. I have to say that I am disappointed. 

Their menu choices are very limited with only about 10 special rolls, some of which have way too similar style. We ordered their sashimi appetizer and 4 special rolls. The sashimi was decent, with one of the sashimi being artificial crab sticks. Really? You call that sashimi? 

The rolls turned out to be pretty reasonable but if you have lots of artificial crab meat, you cannot really go wrong can you? There are definitely way better sushi places out there. There were also very few people in the restaurant for the entire hour we were there, which was regular dinner time on a Thursday. It clearly did not reflect their 4 star rating on Yelp. Their service was also just so-so as we did not get a water refill until we were mostly done with our meal. Nope, don't think I will be visiting this place again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I came here for my birthday. I chose this spot because they have sushi boats. Overall great environment, decent sushi, good service, and fair prices."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,This place gets 3 stars for having so-so entrees and sushi that is pricier than more up-scale sushi restaurants downtown.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Of all the places in Jersey who would think that Madison has excellent sushi?  But low and behold Takara really does have excellent sushi.  I have tried numerous specialty rolls and have been pleased again and again.  The fish is fresh, the rolls are creative, and the staff aims to please here.  It's definitely pricier than other sushi joints in the area, but you get what you pay for."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I  have been going here for years.. YEARS!!  It was the only place I go, but something has changed.  No more friendly staff, you get people who will try to push you off the phone or just flat out lie to you about their store hours.  Oh and I am only talking about the downtown location.   This is after I had to complain about the Chirashi, because they were adding more decorative veggies, than actual fish.  I ended up going to the west side location for that, but now I think I will make the full transfer.  Maybe it's just time to look for a new Sushi place.."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I have never actually had one of the meals at Takara because when I go here I'm interested in sushi and that's it.  Takara never disappoints.  They have fabulous service and well crafted sushi rolls.  My favorites include the Fancy Salmon Roll, Naruto, and Fashion Maki.  You definitely have options for sushi in Madison and going here is a good choice"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara is the reason I love sushi and crave it on a weekly basis.

I used to be skeptical of sushi and didn't think I could ever love raw fish...but now, I'm one of the biggest fans. Whenever I am in Madison, it is imperative that my boyfriend and I have at least one meal at Takara. Their edamame is steamed and salted perfectly and their Spicy Tuna and Spice Salmon rolls always leave me wanting to order more - the rolls are the perfect size... I just never want the bites to end! I have tried 4-5 of their specialty rolls but none of them are as memorable as the Spicy Tuna and Salmon -- but are still great! 

My boyfriend loooves Nigiri and always orders this when we come here. I too like Nigiri but I prefer the rolls. But seeing the satisfaction on his face as he eats each piece will make anyone want to order ""what that guys having"". 

The service can be slow when its swamped on a Friday or Saturday night at the peak times...but thats expected of any restaurant in Madison at that time. However, when we have gone during the week or a Sunday night, the service is great and the servers are extremely nice. 

The only reason I did not give Takara 5 stars is because I have not found any of the specialty rolls to be memorable and crave worthy, but the Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon fill that void - for now! I have not given up on finding that roll....  

I love Takara and definitely would recommend it to everyone who wants a good, affordable sushi meal. Can't wait to try the Love Boat!!!  (which yes... my boyfriend and i have considered ordering to ourselves because Takara is that great)."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Food - Quality of food is so much better here than at the Whitney Way location, special sushi rolls were almost as good as ones I've had in LA or NY, hibachi came with 2 delicious sauces and the shrimp/steak/chicken were full of flavor

Price - 2 of us spent about 90$ for 2 hibachi and 2 special sushi rolls, tips included, for dinner. Can be pricey if you're into steak or seafood hibachi

Service - Great hibachi cook, put on a knife and fire show for us and had us leaning backwards to avoid getting burnt from the nice surprise he had for us. Waiters were generally pretty responsive to our needs

Pros - Quality of sushi rolls, especially the special rolls, are definitely above average. What made me give this 4 stars instead of 3 though is the hibachi grill and the chef that prepared it for us. Very entertaining and the food that came out of it was delish

Cons - Almost none, a bit pricey for dinners.

Overall - Definitely try the hibachi if you have a chance, I've had it elsewhere but the chef who prepares it here at Takara is one of a kind"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"This place was super tasty! I'm originally from California, so it's hard to find good sushi in Wisconsin. Found this place on Yelp when I had a sushi craving, and I was not disappointed! Dropped by around dinner time on a Saturday and was served quite quickly. We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer (was so-so), but the real treat was the sushi boat I ordered. I wasn't a fan of much of the rolls on the original Sushi ""Love"" Boat on the menu, so I asked if I can order a bunch of rolls and hand rolls I like and put it on a sushi boat. They did it. A+ service. Would recommend. Would return."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I am giving this restaurant 4 stars rather than 5 solely because I have never actually stepped foot inside the building - I have just ordered sushi from them on the regular for about 3 months now! Their delivery is fast, their sushi is well made and fresh.  You can get fancy rolls and they are good, but the stand bys (salmon chirashi! yuuuuum) are great and fresh.  Also it is really easy to order online for delivery.  As a true sushi fan who would eat sushi everyday if I could,  I appreciate these things!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Had lunch there yesterday.  We ordered the salmon sushi and salmon roll.  Both were excellent, but the sushi was a little pricey at $2.50 a piece.
We also had the chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura bento box.
the chicken was a disappointment.  Not much teriyaki sauce and was accompanied by wilted sprouts.  Shrimp tempura was very good but only got 2 pieces of shrimp.  there was lots of veggie tempura to go along with it though.  
Bento box also comes with california roll (pretty good) and an excellent mashed potato breaded katsu.  this was the highlight of the bento box.  The miso soup was average.  I personally don't like seaweed in my soup but others may disagree.  
The service was ok.  It took a while to remove plates and the staff all seemed a bit disgruntled.  After only one visit, the highlight seems to be the sushi.  We will go back, but won't be ordering the teriyaki."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"The first Japanese restaurant I visited in Madison, and I sticked to only Takara until now. Their service is just fine, but two of their sushi rolls are my favorite! Try Romantic Roll and Fancy Salmon Roll. Yummmmmmmm. And their dessert: Fried Cheesecake, this I cannot find elsewhere! Crispy on the outside, filled with half-frozen cheese inside. Nyum.

,Also, do not sit on the chairs, but take off your shoes and sit down on the upper floor, it's fun!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,Best sushi in Madison for a very reasonable price. Great for sitting in or taking out.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"We ate here last weekend.  We were definitely jonesing for sushi.  Unfortunately, we found it to be only mediocre here.  After  a couple ""okay"" pieces of salmon, I tried the tuna and it was stringy/chewy.  It actually took about 20 seconds to  get it to the point where I could swallow it.  A second piece was similar.  A couple more and I started to lose interest.  Atmosphere and staff were nice, but wouldn't go again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I started living in Madison in 2004 and at that point had NEVER had sushi before.  I would watch others eat and just say that it wasn't appealing to me.  It was at Takara that I converted.  

In the height of my Takara days, I would go here 2 or 3 times a week.  The food is always consistent and tasty.  Never had a bad bite.  I was told by my Japanese roommate that Wasabi (down the street a few blocks) is a bit more authentic as to what one would get in Japan, but that there was nothing awry with Takara either.

It continues to be THAT place for me that I go when I crave sushi.  The ambience is classy and I especially like the trickling waterfall in the front.  The staff has worked there for many years and they are always professional and quick.  It is a favorite for birthdays and special dinners!!!  I especially like the orange flavored chocolate dessert option."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,We went here for sushi. The waiter was pretty unfriendly and inattentive. Sushi was okay- not rolled well. Shrimp tempura had little flavor to it. Also the rolls are pretty small for the price. I think we'll go elsewhere for sushi next time.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I write this review with the full disclosure that I am not very sushi-savvy.  I was visiting Madison for business recently and was encouraged to check out Takara, so I figured I'd take this colleague up on the recommendation.  I went on a Saturday evening with a group of 7 -- note: for groups of this size, reservations are not a bad idea.  We were able to be seated within about 10 minutes for sushi, but especially if you want a hibachi table, there might be a wait.  My group ordered a variety of rolls, ranging from around $4-8 each.  I ordered the spicy tempura roll, and my inner-wannabe-sushi-eater was pleased.  Super tasty and simple enough to understand as a sushi novice.  Beyond that, the environment was fun and definitely busy, which reflects good quality food. Service was so-so -- our waiter was friendly, but we definitely had empty drink glasses for long periods of time; now that I think of it, I never did get the water refill I requested -- which can be uncomfortable when you accidentally eat way more wasabi than intended.  All in all, A-OK and worth checking out on future visits."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"First, Takara is definitely worth a second visit, but the sushi just wasn't incredible. I mean they do have some cool plates, but the rolls weren't as clean tasting as I would have liked them to be.

If you are looking for good sushi in Madison, I hope that this isn't the best it has to offer but it very well may be. If that is the case you should stick to the standard tuna and salmon first and venture off of those with a critical eye. The unagi just doesn't seem right also, but it is decent."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Nothing like a record breaking protest for democracy in Wisconsin to test the relative abilities of the restaurants near the capitol to handle big crowds.  Takara did much better than most, they managed to squeeze us in within a couple of minutes, and overall, the service was polite, quick, attentive, and competent, by American standards.  By Japanese standards, they were a little rude, no welcome (""irasshaimase""), or oshibori (hot towel to wash up with), or hot tea (ocha). On the way out, polite Japanese waitstaff always thank you (maido arigato!"", or at least just, maido""!, if it's busy)"".  Not here. 
      A note for those of you who are trying to make sense of the rather wide range of ratings from the Yelpers here, the prices are a bargain for sushi if you're from out of town, but by Madison grad student standards, this is an expensive dinner; compared to sushi prices for Madison area Japanese and pseudo-Japanese restaurants, this place is about average.  Yes, the staff is Asian, but no, they are most certainly NOT Japanese.  There are various hints, like, for instance, they don't speak Japanese, and the menu has odd mistakes. For example, instead of tonkatsu, they have ""katsu dipping sauce,"" and they provide spoons with the soups (Japanese soup should be eaten by bringing the bowl up to your face with the fingers of both hands), the food isn't always served in the appropriate (according to Japanese manners) bowls or dishes. So, if you're looking for authentic Japanese, you might be a little disappointed, there's this silly ""Hibachi"" open grill set up for entertainment-cum-Japanese-stereotype dinner, that should be avoided.  
     The sushi on the other hand, is pretty good.  They have a good but not great selection of the standard sushi choices, they also have some original and inventive rolls, I liked my ""samurai roll,"" though it was cut in an odd way.  Japanese sushi should be eaten in one bite, so that the beautifully presented piece isn't aesthetically marred on the way in, but the roll I ordered was cut into pieces too large to get into even my big mouth in one bite.  The unagi, tomago, and toro were quite good, the uni was slightly off (I wonder if it was microwave defrosted).  The edamame was fresh and generous in portion size.  You don't automatically get a bowl of miso first, you have to order it separately, although minor, I didn't like that, on a cold day, it's just good Japanese manners to warm your customers up with really hot miso, and if you're ordering a lot of sushi, the cost of ""complimentary"" miso is really negligible.  
     The tempura and katsu were tasty, but not quite right (the batter and frying oil weren't exactly right).  Tempura is a challenge, the texture has to be just so, it needs to taste light and crispy, very hot, not greasy in spite of the fact that it's fried.  If you've had a lot of Japanese food, you'll know what I mean, the tempura and katsu will be a tad disappointing, if you're not so familiar with authentic Japanese, it's not like the Takara versions are not palatable, they're just not exactly correct.  When tempura is done right, the batter is made with icy water, prepared from scratch just before frying in sesame oil.  If shortcuts are taken, a mixture of cheaper oils, batter made up before hand, lukewarm water is used, then the characteristic texture and taste is slightly off even if the rest of the recipe and cooking process is loyal to tradition.  They're taking some sort of similar shortcut with the katsu, as the breading isn't quite Japanese panko, and they don't serve it cut lengthwise the way the Japanese like it, they've invented a kind of nugget variation. 
      The location is very convenient for either the capitol or the UW-Madison campus."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"If Takara was a person I would marry them.  

3 words: Spicy Tuna Roll.  You will never have a better spicy tuna roll than you will get at Takara.  It is like this nugget of pure deliciosity that explodes in your mouth and you are left wondering how you can relive that moment again and again...then you realize you have 5 more little beautiful tastelets sitting on your plate.  Then you realize you have to share them.  And that kids, is how murder happens.  

For real though, this place is great.  It has kind of ruined me for sushi restaurants forever because I love it so much.  Good prices too, I've never spent more than $50 bucks and I order a ridiculous amount of sushi every time I go.  It's a really good place to ease people into trying sushi.  

One side note, the waitresses all wear their kimonos with the obi tied on the front, which is what Japanese prostitutes used to do...so I've always found that really funny while I'm there.  It doesn't have anything to do with the food, but there ya go.  

The downside of the state street one is all the sororities and frats gather there for sake-bombs on the weekends, which is incredibly annoying.  There's another location off Whitney Way if you want to avoid that crap, and the food is just as good."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,My boyfriend and I were in Madison for the day and we had heard good things about Takara. We ordered the sushi for two. The prices were very reasonable and the sushi was absolutely delicious. The service was very good as well. Highly recommended.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara is pretty good, but the sushi is too darn expensive unless you get the lunch special.  The vegetarian teriyaki was OK, but not spectacular."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,The sushi was good. The service was okay. The udon was okay. The server was nice but spilled my miso soup. 3 stars
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"safe place for sushi.  great service.  

I saw the sushi chef making this cool boat platter with lots of sushi on it.  I want that next time!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"This is the best sushi I have ever had.
Unfortunately, not the best customer service. It wasn't horrible, but after dinner my bf and I agreed that if the service had been a bit better we would have been over the moon happy with Takara. 

That being said....we will still go back time and time again because the sushi was seriously that amazing."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Miso soup was ok, sushi was good, bubble tea was ok . Four stars for the food but two stars only for the  service.
Sushi & rolls presentation - five stars."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I don't have very high standards when it comes to Asian food, but Takara's price and quality just don't match...For a $15 Sukiyaki, I got a bowl of overly sweet chunky beef pieces and some vegetables that shouldn't belong to this dish.My friend ordered a chicken teriyaki for $14 and it was some hard-boiled tasteless chicken strips with raw bean sprouts on the side -- this strange adaptation from Vietnamese-Laotian cuisine just doesn't work. 
For the amount they charge, one is better off with nearby restaurants such as Fugu or Wasabi."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,This is my favorite sushi place in Madison. The sushi is fresh and the atmosphere is nice. My favorites are the spicy tuna and the seared tuna appetizer-- it's really unique and has an interesting sauce that it's served with. They have a nice lunch special too where you can choose a salad or soup and several sushi roll choices for a good price!
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara is the best Japanese/Sushi restaurant in Madison easily! If your looking for great sushi at a reasonable price go for the Takara Lunch Special. For two rolls and either soup/salad it is only $9.50 and for three rolls and either soup/salad it is only $12.25, you can not get a whole lot better than that. 

The spicy California roll is by far the best roll available. I have tried getting spicy California rolls at other restaurants since trying theirs and I have never found something that comes even close to Takaras. 

Takara is also a great place to go for Hibachi. I love sitting around the table while the food is cooked in front of us. It is great for special occasions whether you are on a date or with a group of friends for a birthday."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Been once, and only for the sushi.  The sushi and veg. tempura are good and reasonably priced.  The only reason I'm reviewing Takara is for their spicy tuna roll.  I've been to a lot of different sushi places with a lot of people who love this roll and I want to like it but it always ends up tasting like whatever spicy sauce they use and nothing else.  I'm a fan of spice, but I'm also a fan of tuna.  I'm also a fan of tasting things other than a questionable sauce for the rest of the meal.  I'm not averse to spice, I just don't want it to overpower my tongue for the next few minutes.  

This is where Takara shines.  Their spicy tuna roll actually tastes both good and like spicy tuna.  It is not overpowering, is a pleasant taste rather than just chili oil, and is a welcome addition to any sushi platter.

As others have noted, the crowds are a turn-off and you would probably be better off at wasabi or edo.  Based on food alone though, Takara is just as enjoyable."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. After reading so many reviews, I was  having a  high hope to find another good Japanese restaurant in Madison. Sadly the food is very bland, the sushi is not fresh at all. We ordered sushi for two and you can see some of the meat are cooked due to microwave defrosting."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Good sushi, but a little overpriced in my opinion. Also, they don't do brown rice which is kind of annoying. Overall pretty solid sushi joint. Gets busy around 7."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara has a great lunch special with 3 rolls for around 12 dollars. Sushi isnt great in Madison, but Takara has provided a consistent sushi roll and great lunch special."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I booked a table for 10 last saturday for my mom's b-day. I tried to book for 2:00 but they close for lunch at 2:30 and I changed the rezzo to 1:30. We were all driving in from different places so that's as early as our group could go. 

The staff was extremely attentive and the sushi was really good. And. wow. coming from Chicago...what a steal! All 10 of us ate a hearty lunch (my mom and I got a boat...yes a boat-o-sushi between us) and lots of saki and supporo and the bill was only $245!! 

We also brought cakes for my mom which the staff kept and even decorated with cherries and oranges before bringing them out at around 3:00 with smiles on their faces and a happy, gong accompanied, happy birthday song!

The one star deduction is for the lack of dish clearing throughout the meal. The edaname appetizer remains were sitting there for almost the entire meal. It's a peeve. When I'm done with something please clear it so there is plenty of elbow room especially with a table of 10.

Thank you Takara, for staying late and being great.
The lunch was delish and you helped make my mom's b-day such a lovely day!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"How have I not reviewed this place yet!?  I love sushi...I usually crave it every couple weeks and this is the place to come for satisfaction.  I am never disappointed and there is a lot to watch as everything is made right in front of you.  Takara is also known for its saki bombs, which everyone needs to experience once.  My only complaint is that every time I go in there there seems to be a group of greeks (the fraternity/sorority kind) and they can be a little obnoxious.  It would take more than that to ruin this place though.  Expect to pay about $15-18 a person, but well worth it.  5 stars."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I was pleasantly surprised with the sushi here. I came here at lunchtime and took advantage of the lunch special. I though the tempura was good and fresh. I also thought the rolls were good. Nicely prepared, and good quality fish. The soup was good too. If I have a sushi craving while in Madison, I'd be happy to come here again. It's a good deal at lunch, though I think it was weird this place didn't have tea at lunchtime."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I moved to Madtown from LA a year ago, and I don't know what I'd do without Takara.  In LA, I lived in Little Tokyo, and ate Japanese food at least one meal a day.  So, I would safely say, I'm pretty obsessed w sushi!
This place is better than the other sushi restaurants I've tried in Madison.  (I like Muramoto's restaurants a lot, but they are more like fusion food, and the menus seem kinda limited, and very pricey.)
Anyway, these are my faves from Takara:
Naruto roll:  this is so great because it's rolled in cucumber, and is spicy tuna w no rice.  It's delicious and seems extra healthy, which I appreciate.
Tataki (tuna or beef): seared tuna or steak sliced very thin and served w ponzu (citrus soy sauce).  We always order one of each.  The portion is small but the taste is delicious!  I would eat ten orders of this if I could do so without feeling humiliated!
Special king crab roll:  this is real crab w different colors of caviar (masago, tobiko, etc) on the outside.  How can you go wrong w crab & caviar?!
spinach: I forget what Takara calls it, but it's goma-ai (spinach w sesame sauce)
I've not tried the teppanyaki side of the restaurant, but the chefs over there do the cute entertaining stuff, so that might be a fun place to take a family for a birthday dinner.
It's a good restaurant!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Went for lunch and had the Sushi Lunch where you get four rolls, chef's choice and those blasted California rolls. Overall, incredibly average. I've had better, I've had worse. The chef's sushi selection was decent for the usual suspects, tuna, salmon, mackerel sort of thing. As in, he didn't go out of his way to thrill me. The rice was okay. Consistency was off, little mushy as if it had been formed for 30 seconds too long. Otherwise, I had a pretty good lunch for a very reasonable price. The sushi isn't good enough to eat alone , so bring some good company along and you won't notice."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I love visiting this sushi bar when I'm in the Madison area. The staff is really nice, the sushi chefs are friendly and funny, and the food is delicious. Try the Badger roll - you won't be disappointed! :D"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,Takara has lots of menu options to try. Hibachi grill is a great way to introduce the family to a sushi house. I love to sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare the rolls myself. Some entertain while you drink saki and eat sashimi.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara and Ginza are my favorite sushi places in Madison. I can't speak for Takara's other dishes, just the sushi. They have a spicy tuna roll that's wrapped in cucumber instead of rice - fantastic. I've also gotten the ""love boat"" before, which is a huge boat filled with chefs choice. All very delicious."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Madison and has been for years.  Yes, I've tried Sushi Box.  No, I don't care that the sushi is more 'authentic,' and therefore, 'better.'  I love my Americanized maki!  Put some more avocado and cream cheese on that shit!  ;)

Seriously, though, I am a big fan of their sushi rolls.  I particularly like the Shogun Roll and Spicy Tuna.  I love that their menu says ""Special Roll for Special Customer.""  :D  They have an excellent lunch special, if I'm remembering correctly.  Their entrees are good, too.

I really enjoy the atmosphere (usually quiet, even if there are lots of people), and the service (friendly, attentive and polite).  

One day, out of nowhere (and much to my chagrin), a roach crawled up on my table!  Nothing could've blown my mind more, because this place just looks so clean!  I alerted a waitress, who FREAKED out.  She and several other waitresses had a small shit fit and managed to capture the roach and get rid of it.  They apologized profusely and were so embarrassed.  I am *positive* that the roach mosied on over from the ultra-scuzzy Pizza Di Roma next door.  Still, it's worth mentioning, just in case they really do have roaches.  :)  I'd still go back, though!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"California Roll and Spicy Spider sushi was very good! Also ordered Yaki udon, the WORST udon noodles I've ever had!! They were completely mushy and the vegetables had an acrid taste. Told the waiter immediately to take it away that I did not like it--STILL CHARGED ME FULL PRICE!!! They get 2 stars for sushi, I do NOT recommend."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Outstanding service, nice interior, disappointing food. The tempura was greasy and tasted as though the oil in the fryer hadn't been changed in a while. The sushi was ice cold, a dead giveaway that it wasn't freshly prepared. Prices are reasonable given the amount of food, but don't expect great quality, at least not at lunch."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Appetizers were good and at a fair price. Those of us that had hibachi for dinner found that the quality was fine but it was way overpriced!

For a starter of dumplings and a main dish of chicken and shrimp hibachi, my tab was $40. 

I might return to this place if it was half that price."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Sushi was good, not great. The location is great and the hibachi grills are always fun for groups."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,We've been coming to Takara for years - best sushi in town with a friendly staff.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"My favourite sushi/ sashimi place in town. They definitely have the best selection of sushi, which regularly serving rare treats like mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) and toro. I won't say their cooked food and sometimes the sushi are really top notch, but considering we are in madison and faraway from any japanese settlement, I consider they do a pretty good job"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING!!  Udon, sushi, and HIBACHI!  Seating at sushi bar, regular tables, habachi bar, and on the floor Japanese cushioned seated tables.  All quite good.  And chefs of all ethnicities... so multicultural, this place has it all.

Pros: cheaper and better tasting that Muramoto, also more Asian people, the lunch special
Cons: stains on plating, sticky tables, a lot of oil in hibachi"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I really like their sushi. The rice is of the right consistency and flavour, the fish is tasty and fresh, and it is the only place where I have had conch and sea urchin."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I came to give this place a second chance, and I shouldn't have done so. The service was terrible! I made reservations to sit at the hibachi grill and upon being seated, my boyfriend and I were seated at the back of the grill that was filled by a group of 10. (We basically looked at the backside of the chef). That being said, we didn't get to see anything the chef was doing while cooking our food. Furthermore, our waitress asked our order at the beginning of the night, yet never returned to ask for refills on drinks etc.  The appetizer sushi roll or ordered came right as dinner was being served. I'm very upset with the lack of service that we received at this establishment. I will not be returning and hope that those that brace this place don't experience the poor service that o received."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Took my good friend Sara here on a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area. 

I couldn't be happier with the experience we had. The edamame was excellent, the vegetable tempura was amazing and the hibachi was very good. 

We walked in hungry and left full and very pleased. 

The service was excellent as well.

Can't wait to come back to mad-town and try some of their sushi!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"The lunch sets are a good deal and habachi display is cool.  I find this place too expensive,especially after another Japanese restaurant called Osaka opened a few blocks away which offers a variety of sushi and bento box for a more reasonable price,quality is a little inferior of course but well worth your money."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Had a terrific dinner here while visiting Madison.  I really enjoyed my sushi, and my wife had a great Bento Box."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Vegetable tempura was enjoyable, and the rolls that came with vegetable sushi entree that contained fried vegetables were very tasty. Otherwise, I thought the food was just ok. I ordered a salad and it was dressing with a little bit of lettuce. Good service and it was fun to watch the sushi chefs perform their art."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 

Shame on me. I went here twice. Big big mistake. Well, not that big, since it's reasonably priced, but damn, I could have gotten better sushi from the grocery store. 

I went here three years ago. I don't at all recall what I got. It was likely something on the sushi spectrum. I recall a vague mental note-to-self saying ""don't go to that place again"". 

I went here earlier this week and kept it simple: a California roll and a spicy tuna. C'mon, who could make these things unpleasant? They're usually so good, so dependable. While they were certainly edible, they weren't *good*. The spicy tuna maki was a gelatinous blob surrounded by rice and the California roll did was much too heavy on the mayonnaise and much too light on the avocado. I really did not find either to be worthwhile. I did, however, try some of my friend's tempura bento box, which had some nicely done tempura-ed vegetables. 

Overall, it wasn't all bad. The service was a little too eager, but very polite and attentive, which is refreshing."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Was it the best sushi I've ever had? No. Will I be back anyways? Yes. 

Came here with a friend last night (Thursday) after failing to get a table at Red. The ambiance is what you'd expect at a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant. A little tacky but it works. Our service was fine and pretty quick. A little less than half of the restaurant was full so that was probably part of the reason. 

Their house wine was not very good. I know I should expect that when paying $4 for a glass of wine, but I've had better for the same price. However our rolls were delicious. Between the two of us we had the spicy tuna roll, shogun roll and salmon and avocado roll. Everything was fresh and tasted very good. We finished it all within about 15 minutes!

I noticed they also do hibachi, I'll be anxious to try that next time I'm in.

Overall, a fine place to go for some reasonably priced sushi and/or Japanese food. I will be back!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"If you're a sushi enthusiast like myself, then this is the place for you.

The sushi is extremely fresh and well made. The prices are reasonable, ranging anywhere from ~$4 for basic rolls to ~$12 for fancier ones. 2 orders will definitely fill you up, so I recommend bringing a few friends and ordering a couple to share amongst yourselves. 

You can't really go wrong with any of the sushi, but I personally liked the Naruto, Philadelphia Roll and Fashion Maki.

If you're not in the mood for sushi, they also offer a wide selection of hibachi. Now keep in mind that the hibachi comes with salad, soup and rice, so only order it if you're really, really hungry. Also, it's doused in soy sauce, so if that's not your jam, request less sauce. 

The service is a bit slow (roughly 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the party), but the food is definitely worth it.

I will definitely be frequenting this place quite often. 

PS: They also offer sake bombs!!111shiftone!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I really should give up on sushi in Madison. I really miss the interesting things people came up with for GOOD vegetarian rolls. Takara only offered the very basic rolls (vegetable tempura, avocado, kampyo, nato, cucumber) and my whole meal was just boring.

And stale.

Derek ordered the Fancy Salmon roll and I ordered the vegetable tempura. It seems like a sushi roll that has been deep fried in tempura batter couldn't mess up, but both of ours were stale. I bit into mine and could barely chomp through. HOW ROMANTIC. We just went there last night and I don't remember anything else we got.

Our waiter and waitress were pretty awkward and shy, and obviously not interested in us at all. No smiles, all business. I did see them smile when the 4 girls there to begin their friend's 21st birthday party got crazy during the Happy Birthday song. They actually were the only thing making me smile (besides my fiance across from me) because they did seem so happy to be sake bombing.  It made me want to re-celebrate my 21st birthday!

So, yeah, I wouldn't bother again. I think if we want sushi here, we'll go to Wasabi next time."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,Good sushi with a reasonable price. Takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Ordered some rolls to go for lunch. Per my online order receipt, I ordered tekka and sake, but ended up a sake and alaskan roll instead. Didn't notice it until I was already back at the office. I'm not a fan of wasabi being in a regular sake roll, either. Even if it is more ""authentic,"" I'd rather it be an option on the side. Overall, wasn't terrible sushi, but the cheaper, more ""express"" places around campus seem to offer the same taste/quality, so I'll probably choose them for a quick sushi fix in the future."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Sushi here was really good, go for the crunchy shrimp. The Katsu Don was average, not anything special. Restaurant is owned chinese people, not authentic Japanese."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"This place was good, and I enjoyed my meal here. I had the edamame, ginger salad, and a sushi combo of spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy california rolls. 

The rolls were pretty good; I like to dip my sushi into more spicy mayo, and I think I'd come back for this combo again. It wasn't anything spectacular or special that I would die to try again, but I enjoyed it. The salad was just a little off to me. The greens were drowned in a thick garlic sauce, and I saw myself digging to find lettuce that wasn't covered in it. I did not enjoy the salad, so I think I'll ask for the soup next time.

The restaurant looked pretty small, but the environment was cute and cozy. I liked hearing the chefs in the background cooking. Overall, I can see myself enjoying this place with a large group of people if we sat in the back with the flat stove top."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"The sushi here is great! It's fresh and compared to the other sushi restaurant on State St they actually make it correctly and worth the money it is on the menu.

The wait are friendly but they seem generally disinterested. Of course they also sat me at the sushi bar were they pick up the sushi orders and I kept having to lean out of the way for them to get food. Also, of the three people on staff for the wait staff were taking turns sitting in the far corner rolling utensils while the third answered the phones and generally ignored the patrons in the restaurant. However, I do appreciate the not overly attentive staff compared to some other sushi restaurants I've been to. 

Overall I think I'll be going here more often to see if it's any different the second time, but I wasn't overly impress with my first visit."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I can always count on Takara to deliver good, quick, and affordable sushi!

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a california roll, and the calamari appetizer. My husband and I both agreed that we should have skipped the calamari and got another roll. Our friends got spicy salmon & a rainbow roll & they loved their selections as well.

Surprisingly good: the old fashioned. My husband ordered it as a bit of a joke (not expecting a great old fashioned at a Japanese restaurant), but he was happy with it. We've definitely had worse!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Visited my sister this weekend and we were really looking forward to getting sushi at Red. We walked in and there was a 1 1/2 hour wait and we were starving so we decided to go to Takara instead. Bad idea, first off, we were sat next to the fountain and it smelled so bad, like a dirty fish tank. The edamame was decent, some of it had gone brown, but tasted alright. We got a spicy tuna roll and some specialty roll, the tuna roll had some ""brownage""going on which kinda worried us, but we were starving so we ate it, definitely not great sushi by any means. All we cared about was not getting food poisoning. We lucked out, felt fine the rest of the evening, but our clothes wreaked of a cheap China Buffett the rest of the night out, barf! So overall, never would I go to this place again!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I've eaten at a few hibachi spots and I have to say this one just might have topped them all. Go figure! In Madison, of all places.

The man and I were the only two sitting at the grill and we were surprised to find that the chef still went above and beyond despite only having us as an audience. He was definitely determined to get that onion volcano going even though we didn't really care if he did or not since we've seen it a million times. But after 4 or 5 times, he finally got it. He was very entertaining and his jokes were cheesy but made us laugh. Spinning an egg on the grill and calling it an ""egg roll?"" Ha-ha!

The portion of the food was ginormous for the both of us. The vegetables themselves seemed like it could've been split to more than 2 portions. We ordered the filet mignon, shrimp, salmon, and chicken....all of which we dipped in the amaaaaaaazing seafood sauce. And the chef even gave us extra before he left.

The only thing we didn't like was that it was $2.95 for fried rice. Eh? I guess I'm used to it being included back home in L.A. Oh well.

Love the hibachi experience here. Haven't tried the sushi yet. One day!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"Takara was my introduction to sushi. I never ate in the restaurant, but my roommate** and I ordered take-out quite a lot. My favorite thing was to bring sushi up to Concerts on the Square in the summer. 

For those who are also getting their sushi education at Takara, I highly recommend their veggie tempura roll. I would still order that today, even now that I will eat practically any fish, raw or cooked (my education was expedited when I worked at a sushi bar after college).

Hibachi will cost you, but Takara is really cheap for sushi. It didn't seem like it on a student's budget, I know. To put it in perspective, In Minneapolis (which isn't even an expensive city), a big specialty roll can run close to $20 -- at Takara, nothing is over $14. Their two- or three-roll lunch specials... I don't even wanna talk about it. Be thankful, Madison. Damned thankful.

**My college roommate could eat wasabi by the handful."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"I took my girlfriend here for lunch and I found hair in my salad and our sushi was bland.. we got five different rolls to split and none of them had very much flavor... even the two spicy rolls we got weren't spicy at all.. It was really disappointing.. It wasn't worth paying 40 dollars for, I've had better sushi from the grocery store"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,31. sushi appetizers 4 pieces,"My wife and I went here tonight after previously going to Takara's other location on the west side of town. Both times, I have walked away pretty impressed with the sushi there.

Full disclosure: I am by NO means a sushi connoisseur, or even someone who knows much about sushi. When we go out for sushi, my wife usually just orders a variety of rolls and I sample everything.

However, I have eaten at a handful of different sushi joints, and Takara has consistently been one of the better ones I've sampled. The service was blisteringly quick, the drinks were pretty good, and the sushi was excellent. 

We will definitely be back!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"When in the Madison area, one can never go wrong dining at Takara. It is hard to find decent sushi restaurants in the state of WI yet Takara is truly an exception. The fish and sushi preparation has shown consistent quality and preparation the 4+ years I have been frequenting. The appetizers are all delicious and appealing , the sushi is fresh and rolled tight, and the fried rice is perfectly prepared with vegetables meat of choice and that delicious hibachi smokey flavor. Whether I order as take out or dine in the quality is always consistent. The only complaint is that the service is very slow, even if you are one of two tables in the restaurant, in which case you will have to politely remind the server to remember your drinks etc. When I do dine at Takara I always order from their online menu ( I use my smart phone to look it up ) as the variety of rolls is greater than the printed menus."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"We stopped by as a party of 6 for a birthday dinner. The experience was interesting and sub-par. 

The Food - Out of everything the food was probably the only thing that went right. Salmon was fresh, avocado was fresh, fish to rice ratio was good. Although there weren't too many signature rolls to chose from. Rolls had different names, but everything was pretty much the same, nothing special. 

Rolls ordered

Rainbow Roll - Average 
Salmon Avocado - Generous with their salmon, avocado was fresh
House Special Roll (forgot the name) - Wrapped in white seaweed, first time trying that. The roll had 3 types of fish on the inside hamachi, salmon, and tuna. Interesting roll, tasted great. 

Pricing - Average pricing 8-13 per roll, again just wish they had more rolls to chose from. 

Service - Service was interesting, our first waiter was clueless about our menu. Our second waiter forgot about a cup of tea we ordered with our entrees and appetizers. Along with that he even forgot about an order of appetizers. When the bill came we asked for split bills, that came back immediately. But then we were left in the corner we sat in, no one ever came to take our bills. After 10 minutes of attempting to get the attention of our server we just decided to go up to the cashier and pay ourselves. The cashier took about 10 minutes to finalize 5 bills. In total, we waited 20 minutes to pay and leave; horrible service. 

In all 
Service was horrible.
Sushi was fresh. 
Reasonable pricing. 
Not enough variety of rolls

Probably won't be back again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I ordered delivery from here and we were very happy with the meal!  The sushi was very tasty and my 10-yr-old sister gobbled up her adult-portion of noodles.  We also ordered edamame and seaweed salad, both of which were served just the way we liked it.

A note about the delivery:  First, they were fast!  (I hate waiting for food and appreciate this!)  Second, they separated the hot and the cold food.  How great is that??  One bag for the sushi and seaweed salad and another for the noodles and edamame.  Super helpful since we weren't eating it right away.  We will order from here again!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I've been to Takara many times in the past, and ordered takeout recently only to be disappointed.  As far as I'm concerned, their entrees and cooked dishes are far better than their sushi.  The soba noodles are delicious, the sushi, not so much.  I ordered a Naruto and an Iso fantastic roll, both of which were gigantic.  I don't think you should have to cut a piece of sushi into pieces just to be able to eat it, but with the rolls at Takara, you do.  The fish seemed semi fresh, and the rice was well cooked, but both the rolls I ordered at least 3 inches in diameter and had an inch layer thick of rice, which made them hard to eat.  One positive thing I will say is that their house ginger dressing is amazing, and I'd recommend the house salad.  Overall, I really used to like this place, but my most recent experience was a bit sub par.  Skip the sushi and go for the entrees."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,I'm from L.A. and know what a great sushi is.  I went here while on a business trip from the reviews on Yelp. Takara far exceeded my expectations.  I had I had the Unagi bowl and some sushi.  Taste was excellent and presentation is exceptional!  I will be coming here every time I come to Madison.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,Went there for the first time in a few years and had a wonderful lunch. Great sushi and fast service.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Sushi in Madison, WI.? Really. Color me skeptical.
OK, perhaps I'm a bit of a Minneapolis snob. Minneapolis,  you know, the birthplace of sushi, the home of sushi, where sushi was invented, where sushi is prepared with fish caught from our very own ocean.
But Madison? Well, color me impressed.
Tasty, fresh sushi beautifully presented.
The server-by-committee left a few holes at times, but had its own charm at the same time. 
All in all, a nice meal. If my daughter chooses the school with the red and white badger, I look forward to eating here again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,Three and a half--Perfectly good sushi and rolls for a reasonable price.  My faves are the spicy tuna and eel and avocado rolls.  Takara is a frequent lunch destination for me and buddies from work--we prefer the State Street location because it seems to be a bit quieter than the one on Whitney Way.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara is very uneven.  Sometimes the food is very good.  Other times the service is surly and unpleasant.  At times, late in the evening, it is noisy with lots of loud drinking games.  The last time we were there we were so disappointed we have not been back.  Better sushi in other places in Madison.  And better treatment of customers (in my view)"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"WORST SUSHI EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!  I have been to Takara 3 times.  The first two were average.  This last time was horrific.  I ordered the Crab roll, 2 spicy tuna rolls, and the eastern roll and the rice was extremely dry and hard in ALL of my rolls.  It was so hard that I could hear crunching sounds in my head as I chewed my sushi.  I told the waiter and the manager and they just said ""that's how sushi is supposed to be.""  They did not make any adjustments to my bill nor did they offer a replacement.  POOR FOOD AND POOR SERVICE!!!  I'm never coming back again.  Go to Sushi Muramoto instead!!  Their service never disappoints."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,Second best sushi in Madison.  Best lunch and best sushi downtown.  The bento boxes are such a great deal I take anyone visiting Madison to lunch there.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I love sushi and tar tar, so raw is not a problem.  The delivery from this place took and hour, which could be improved, but not my primary concern.  The three rolls that I had with crunch, were a bit soggy and certainly not crunchy.  More importantly the philly roll I ordered was horrible.  It was inedible.  The salmon was so tough it felt more like I was chewing on a carrot and my gag reflexes started to kick in.  I would advise against ordering here if you enjoy well made fresh sushi."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I found this place on Yelp. I was meeting up with a group of friends, all our first time in Madison. Their reviews look reasonably pleasant. I have to say that I am disappointed. 

Their menu choices are very limited with only about 10 special rolls, some of which have way too similar style. We ordered their sashimi appetizer and 4 special rolls. The sashimi was decent, with one of the sashimi being artificial crab sticks. Really? You call that sashimi? 

The rolls turned out to be pretty reasonable but if you have lots of artificial crab meat, you cannot really go wrong can you? There are definitely way better sushi places out there. There were also very few people in the restaurant for the entire hour we were there, which was regular dinner time on a Thursday. It clearly did not reflect their 4 star rating on Yelp. Their service was also just so-so as we did not get a water refill until we were mostly done with our meal. Nope, don't think I will be visiting this place again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I came here for my birthday. I chose this spot because they have sushi boats. Overall great environment, decent sushi, good service, and fair prices."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,This place gets 3 stars for having so-so entrees and sushi that is pricier than more up-scale sushi restaurants downtown.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Of all the places in Jersey who would think that Madison has excellent sushi?  But low and behold Takara really does have excellent sushi.  I have tried numerous specialty rolls and have been pleased again and again.  The fish is fresh, the rolls are creative, and the staff aims to please here.  It's definitely pricier than other sushi joints in the area, but you get what you pay for."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I  have been going here for years.. YEARS!!  It was the only place I go, but something has changed.  No more friendly staff, you get people who will try to push you off the phone or just flat out lie to you about their store hours.  Oh and I am only talking about the downtown location.   This is after I had to complain about the Chirashi, because they were adding more decorative veggies, than actual fish.  I ended up going to the west side location for that, but now I think I will make the full transfer.  Maybe it's just time to look for a new Sushi place.."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I have never actually had one of the meals at Takara because when I go here I'm interested in sushi and that's it.  Takara never disappoints.  They have fabulous service and well crafted sushi rolls.  My favorites include the Fancy Salmon Roll, Naruto, and Fashion Maki.  You definitely have options for sushi in Madison and going here is a good choice"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara is the reason I love sushi and crave it on a weekly basis.

I used to be skeptical of sushi and didn't think I could ever love raw fish...but now, I'm one of the biggest fans. Whenever I am in Madison, it is imperative that my boyfriend and I have at least one meal at Takara. Their edamame is steamed and salted perfectly and their Spicy Tuna and Spice Salmon rolls always leave me wanting to order more - the rolls are the perfect size... I just never want the bites to end! I have tried 4-5 of their specialty rolls but none of them are as memorable as the Spicy Tuna and Salmon -- but are still great! 

My boyfriend loooves Nigiri and always orders this when we come here. I too like Nigiri but I prefer the rolls. But seeing the satisfaction on his face as he eats each piece will make anyone want to order ""what that guys having"". 

The service can be slow when its swamped on a Friday or Saturday night at the peak times...but thats expected of any restaurant in Madison at that time. However, when we have gone during the week or a Sunday night, the service is great and the servers are extremely nice. 

The only reason I did not give Takara 5 stars is because I have not found any of the specialty rolls to be memorable and crave worthy, but the Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon fill that void - for now! I have not given up on finding that roll....  

I love Takara and definitely would recommend it to everyone who wants a good, affordable sushi meal. Can't wait to try the Love Boat!!!  (which yes... my boyfriend and i have considered ordering to ourselves because Takara is that great)."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Food - Quality of food is so much better here than at the Whitney Way location, special sushi rolls were almost as good as ones I've had in LA or NY, hibachi came with 2 delicious sauces and the shrimp/steak/chicken were full of flavor

Price - 2 of us spent about 90$ for 2 hibachi and 2 special sushi rolls, tips included, for dinner. Can be pricey if you're into steak or seafood hibachi

Service - Great hibachi cook, put on a knife and fire show for us and had us leaning backwards to avoid getting burnt from the nice surprise he had for us. Waiters were generally pretty responsive to our needs

Pros - Quality of sushi rolls, especially the special rolls, are definitely above average. What made me give this 4 stars instead of 3 though is the hibachi grill and the chef that prepared it for us. Very entertaining and the food that came out of it was delish

Cons - Almost none, a bit pricey for dinners.

Overall - Definitely try the hibachi if you have a chance, I've had it elsewhere but the chef who prepares it here at Takara is one of a kind"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"This place was super tasty! I'm originally from California, so it's hard to find good sushi in Wisconsin. Found this place on Yelp when I had a sushi craving, and I was not disappointed! Dropped by around dinner time on a Saturday and was served quite quickly. We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer (was so-so), but the real treat was the sushi boat I ordered. I wasn't a fan of much of the rolls on the original Sushi ""Love"" Boat on the menu, so I asked if I can order a bunch of rolls and hand rolls I like and put it on a sushi boat. They did it. A+ service. Would recommend. Would return."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I am giving this restaurant 4 stars rather than 5 solely because I have never actually stepped foot inside the building - I have just ordered sushi from them on the regular for about 3 months now! Their delivery is fast, their sushi is well made and fresh.  You can get fancy rolls and they are good, but the stand bys (salmon chirashi! yuuuuum) are great and fresh.  Also it is really easy to order online for delivery.  As a true sushi fan who would eat sushi everyday if I could,  I appreciate these things!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Had lunch there yesterday.  We ordered the salmon sushi and salmon roll.  Both were excellent, but the sushi was a little pricey at $2.50 a piece.
We also had the chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura bento box.
the chicken was a disappointment.  Not much teriyaki sauce and was accompanied by wilted sprouts.  Shrimp tempura was very good but only got 2 pieces of shrimp.  there was lots of veggie tempura to go along with it though.  
Bento box also comes with california roll (pretty good) and an excellent mashed potato breaded katsu.  this was the highlight of the bento box.  The miso soup was average.  I personally don't like seaweed in my soup but others may disagree.  
The service was ok.  It took a while to remove plates and the staff all seemed a bit disgruntled.  After only one visit, the highlight seems to be the sushi.  We will go back, but won't be ordering the teriyaki."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"The first Japanese restaurant I visited in Madison, and I sticked to only Takara until now. Their service is just fine, but two of their sushi rolls are my favorite! Try Romantic Roll and Fancy Salmon Roll. Yummmmmmmm. And their dessert: Fried Cheesecake, this I cannot find elsewhere! Crispy on the outside, filled with half-frozen cheese inside. Nyum.

,Also, do not sit on the chairs, but take off your shoes and sit down on the upper floor, it's fun!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,Best sushi in Madison for a very reasonable price. Great for sitting in or taking out.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"We ate here last weekend.  We were definitely jonesing for sushi.  Unfortunately, we found it to be only mediocre here.  After  a couple ""okay"" pieces of salmon, I tried the tuna and it was stringy/chewy.  It actually took about 20 seconds to  get it to the point where I could swallow it.  A second piece was similar.  A couple more and I started to lose interest.  Atmosphere and staff were nice, but wouldn't go again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I started living in Madison in 2004 and at that point had NEVER had sushi before.  I would watch others eat and just say that it wasn't appealing to me.  It was at Takara that I converted.  

In the height of my Takara days, I would go here 2 or 3 times a week.  The food is always consistent and tasty.  Never had a bad bite.  I was told by my Japanese roommate that Wasabi (down the street a few blocks) is a bit more authentic as to what one would get in Japan, but that there was nothing awry with Takara either.

It continues to be THAT place for me that I go when I crave sushi.  The ambience is classy and I especially like the trickling waterfall in the front.  The staff has worked there for many years and they are always professional and quick.  It is a favorite for birthdays and special dinners!!!  I especially like the orange flavored chocolate dessert option."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I LOVE Takara! For being in the Midwest their fish is incredibly fresh. I have never had a bad meal here. I always get their spicy tuna roll, by far the best in Madison! Bento boxes for lunch are great, as is their hibachi."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,We went here for sushi. The waiter was pretty unfriendly and inattentive. Sushi was okay- not rolled well. Shrimp tempura had little flavor to it. Also the rolls are pretty small for the price. I think we'll go elsewhere for sushi next time.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I write this review with the full disclosure that I am not very sushi-savvy.  I was visiting Madison for business recently and was encouraged to check out Takara, so I figured I'd take this colleague up on the recommendation.  I went on a Saturday evening with a group of 7 -- note: for groups of this size, reservations are not a bad idea.  We were able to be seated within about 10 minutes for sushi, but especially if you want a hibachi table, there might be a wait.  My group ordered a variety of rolls, ranging from around $4-8 each.  I ordered the spicy tempura roll, and my inner-wannabe-sushi-eater was pleased.  Super tasty and simple enough to understand as a sushi novice.  Beyond that, the environment was fun and definitely busy, which reflects good quality food. Service was so-so -- our waiter was friendly, but we definitely had empty drink glasses for long periods of time; now that I think of it, I never did get the water refill I requested -- which can be uncomfortable when you accidentally eat way more wasabi than intended.  All in all, A-OK and worth checking out on future visits."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"First, Takara is definitely worth a second visit, but the sushi just wasn't incredible. I mean they do have some cool plates, but the rolls weren't as clean tasting as I would have liked them to be.

If you are looking for good sushi in Madison, I hope that this isn't the best it has to offer but it very well may be. If that is the case you should stick to the standard tuna and salmon first and venture off of those with a critical eye. The unagi just doesn't seem right also, but it is decent."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Nothing like a record breaking protest for democracy in Wisconsin to test the relative abilities of the restaurants near the capitol to handle big crowds.  Takara did much better than most, they managed to squeeze us in within a couple of minutes, and overall, the service was polite, quick, attentive, and competent, by American standards.  By Japanese standards, they were a little rude, no welcome (""irasshaimase""), or oshibori (hot towel to wash up with), or hot tea (ocha). On the way out, polite Japanese waitstaff always thank you (maido arigato!"", or at least just, maido""!, if it's busy)"".  Not here. 
      A note for those of you who are trying to make sense of the rather wide range of ratings from the Yelpers here, the prices are a bargain for sushi if you're from out of town, but by Madison grad student standards, this is an expensive dinner; compared to sushi prices for Madison area Japanese and pseudo-Japanese restaurants, this place is about average.  Yes, the staff is Asian, but no, they are most certainly NOT Japanese.  There are various hints, like, for instance, they don't speak Japanese, and the menu has odd mistakes. For example, instead of tonkatsu, they have ""katsu dipping sauce,"" and they provide spoons with the soups (Japanese soup should be eaten by bringing the bowl up to your face with the fingers of both hands), the food isn't always served in the appropriate (according to Japanese manners) bowls or dishes. So, if you're looking for authentic Japanese, you might be a little disappointed, there's this silly ""Hibachi"" open grill set up for entertainment-cum-Japanese-stereotype dinner, that should be avoided.  
     The sushi on the other hand, is pretty good.  They have a good but not great selection of the standard sushi choices, they also have some original and inventive rolls, I liked my ""samurai roll,"" though it was cut in an odd way.  Japanese sushi should be eaten in one bite, so that the beautifully presented piece isn't aesthetically marred on the way in, but the roll I ordered was cut into pieces too large to get into even my big mouth in one bite.  The unagi, tomago, and toro were quite good, the uni was slightly off (I wonder if it was microwave defrosted).  The edamame was fresh and generous in portion size.  You don't automatically get a bowl of miso first, you have to order it separately, although minor, I didn't like that, on a cold day, it's just good Japanese manners to warm your customers up with really hot miso, and if you're ordering a lot of sushi, the cost of ""complimentary"" miso is really negligible.  
     The tempura and katsu were tasty, but not quite right (the batter and frying oil weren't exactly right).  Tempura is a challenge, the texture has to be just so, it needs to taste light and crispy, very hot, not greasy in spite of the fact that it's fried.  If you've had a lot of Japanese food, you'll know what I mean, the tempura and katsu will be a tad disappointing, if you're not so familiar with authentic Japanese, it's not like the Takara versions are not palatable, they're just not exactly correct.  When tempura is done right, the batter is made with icy water, prepared from scratch just before frying in sesame oil.  If shortcuts are taken, a mixture of cheaper oils, batter made up before hand, lukewarm water is used, then the characteristic texture and taste is slightly off even if the rest of the recipe and cooking process is loyal to tradition.  They're taking some sort of similar shortcut with the katsu, as the breading isn't quite Japanese panko, and they don't serve it cut lengthwise the way the Japanese like it, they've invented a kind of nugget variation. 
      The location is very convenient for either the capitol or the UW-Madison campus."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"If Takara was a person I would marry them.  

3 words: Spicy Tuna Roll.  You will never have a better spicy tuna roll than you will get at Takara.  It is like this nugget of pure deliciosity that explodes in your mouth and you are left wondering how you can relive that moment again and again...then you realize you have 5 more little beautiful tastelets sitting on your plate.  Then you realize you have to share them.  And that kids, is how murder happens.  

For real though, this place is great.  It has kind of ruined me for sushi restaurants forever because I love it so much.  Good prices too, I've never spent more than $50 bucks and I order a ridiculous amount of sushi every time I go.  It's a really good place to ease people into trying sushi.  

One side note, the waitresses all wear their kimonos with the obi tied on the front, which is what Japanese prostitutes used to do...so I've always found that really funny while I'm there.  It doesn't have anything to do with the food, but there ya go.  

The downside of the state street one is all the sororities and frats gather there for sake-bombs on the weekends, which is incredibly annoying.  There's another location off Whitney Way if you want to avoid that crap, and the food is just as good."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,My boyfriend and I were in Madison for the day and we had heard good things about Takara. We ordered the sushi for two. The prices were very reasonable and the sushi was absolutely delicious. The service was very good as well. Highly recommended.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara is pretty good, but the sushi is too darn expensive unless you get the lunch special.  The vegetarian teriyaki was OK, but not spectacular."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,Excellent lunch specials. Love the Bento Box lunches.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,The sushi was good. The service was okay. The udon was okay. The server was nice but spilled my miso soup. 3 stars
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"safe place for sushi.  great service.  

I saw the sushi chef making this cool boat platter with lots of sushi on it.  I want that next time!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"This is the best sushi I have ever had.
Unfortunately, not the best customer service. It wasn't horrible, but after dinner my bf and I agreed that if the service had been a bit better we would have been over the moon happy with Takara. 

That being said....we will still go back time and time again because the sushi was seriously that amazing."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Miso soup was ok, sushi was good, bubble tea was ok . Four stars for the food but two stars only for the  service.
Sushi & rolls presentation - five stars."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,This is my favorite sushi place in Madison. The sushi is fresh and the atmosphere is nice. My favorites are the spicy tuna and the seared tuna appetizer-- it's really unique and has an interesting sauce that it's served with. They have a nice lunch special too where you can choose a salad or soup and several sushi roll choices for a good price!
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara is the best Japanese/Sushi restaurant in Madison easily! If your looking for great sushi at a reasonable price go for the Takara Lunch Special. For two rolls and either soup/salad it is only $9.50 and for three rolls and either soup/salad it is only $12.25, you can not get a whole lot better than that. 

The spicy California roll is by far the best roll available. I have tried getting spicy California rolls at other restaurants since trying theirs and I have never found something that comes even close to Takaras. 

Takara is also a great place to go for Hibachi. I love sitting around the table while the food is cooked in front of us. It is great for special occasions whether you are on a date or with a group of friends for a birthday."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Been once, and only for the sushi.  The sushi and veg. tempura are good and reasonably priced.  The only reason I'm reviewing Takara is for their spicy tuna roll.  I've been to a lot of different sushi places with a lot of people who love this roll and I want to like it but it always ends up tasting like whatever spicy sauce they use and nothing else.  I'm a fan of spice, but I'm also a fan of tuna.  I'm also a fan of tasting things other than a questionable sauce for the rest of the meal.  I'm not averse to spice, I just don't want it to overpower my tongue for the next few minutes.  

This is where Takara shines.  Their spicy tuna roll actually tastes both good and like spicy tuna.  It is not overpowering, is a pleasant taste rather than just chili oil, and is a welcome addition to any sushi platter.

As others have noted, the crowds are a turn-off and you would probably be better off at wasabi or edo.  Based on food alone though, Takara is just as enjoyable."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. After reading so many reviews, I was  having a  high hope to find another good Japanese restaurant in Madison. Sadly the food is very bland, the sushi is not fresh at all. We ordered sushi for two and you can see some of the meat are cooked due to microwave defrosting."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Good sushi, but a little overpriced in my opinion. Also, they don't do brown rice which is kind of annoying. Overall pretty solid sushi joint. Gets busy around 7."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara has a great lunch special with 3 rolls for around 12 dollars. Sushi isnt great in Madison, but Takara has provided a consistent sushi roll and great lunch special."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I probably eat lunch here 2-3 times a month.  Their spicy tuna roll, which I admit is my central criterion for judging Japanese restaurants, is AMAZING--spicy but not killer, not too much mayo, and a generally nice texture with some crunch from tempura bits.  I also really like their vegetable tempura roll with asparagus and sweet potato.

The lunch special is $9.50 for two rolls with soup or salad; $12.50 for three rolls with soup or salad.  They also have very nicely priced bento box meals.  The shrimp tempura seems a little bland to me, but I really like the veggie version.  Shumai and gyoza are also very good here.

I don't do the hibachi thing, but did once sit at the hibachi table when I came in with a large group.  They were very accommodating to us, which didn't surprise me, as service is generally good.

Highly recommended: hot sake with dinner in the winter; green tea with lunch."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I booked a table for 10 last saturday for my mom's b-day. I tried to book for 2:00 but they close for lunch at 2:30 and I changed the rezzo to 1:30. We were all driving in from different places so that's as early as our group could go. 

The staff was extremely attentive and the sushi was really good. And. wow. coming from Chicago...what a steal! All 10 of us ate a hearty lunch (my mom and I got a boat...yes a boat-o-sushi between us) and lots of saki and supporo and the bill was only $245!! 

We also brought cakes for my mom which the staff kept and even decorated with cherries and oranges before bringing them out at around 3:00 with smiles on their faces and a happy, gong accompanied, happy birthday song!

The one star deduction is for the lack of dish clearing throughout the meal. The edaname appetizer remains were sitting there for almost the entire meal. It's a peeve. When I'm done with something please clear it so there is plenty of elbow room especially with a table of 10.

Thank you Takara, for staying late and being great.
The lunch was delish and you helped make my mom's b-day such a lovely day!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"How have I not reviewed this place yet!?  I love sushi...I usually crave it every couple weeks and this is the place to come for satisfaction.  I am never disappointed and there is a lot to watch as everything is made right in front of you.  Takara is also known for its saki bombs, which everyone needs to experience once.  My only complaint is that every time I go in there there seems to be a group of greeks (the fraternity/sorority kind) and they can be a little obnoxious.  It would take more than that to ruin this place though.  Expect to pay about $15-18 a person, but well worth it.  5 stars."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I was pleasantly surprised with the sushi here. I came here at lunchtime and took advantage of the lunch special. I though the tempura was good and fresh. I also thought the rolls were good. Nicely prepared, and good quality fish. The soup was good too. If I have a sushi craving while in Madison, I'd be happy to come here again. It's a good deal at lunch, though I think it was weird this place didn't have tea at lunchtime."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"eh- location is good and the lunch special is cheap ($8 for two rolls and soup or salad), but you could probably do just as well with grocery store rolls. It's usually busy and can be fun for groups for this reason, but don't expect to be impressed- the unique rolls are expensive and the rest are boring and average."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I moved to Madtown from LA a year ago, and I don't know what I'd do without Takara.  In LA, I lived in Little Tokyo, and ate Japanese food at least one meal a day.  So, I would safely say, I'm pretty obsessed w sushi!
This place is better than the other sushi restaurants I've tried in Madison.  (I like Muramoto's restaurants a lot, but they are more like fusion food, and the menus seem kinda limited, and very pricey.)
Anyway, these are my faves from Takara:
Naruto roll:  this is so great because it's rolled in cucumber, and is spicy tuna w no rice.  It's delicious and seems extra healthy, which I appreciate.
Tataki (tuna or beef): seared tuna or steak sliced very thin and served w ponzu (citrus soy sauce).  We always order one of each.  The portion is small but the taste is delicious!  I would eat ten orders of this if I could do so without feeling humiliated!
Special king crab roll:  this is real crab w different colors of caviar (masago, tobiko, etc) on the outside.  How can you go wrong w crab & caviar?!
spinach: I forget what Takara calls it, but it's goma-ai (spinach w sesame sauce)
I've not tried the teppanyaki side of the restaurant, but the chefs over there do the cute entertaining stuff, so that might be a fun place to take a family for a birthday dinner.
It's a good restaurant!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Went for lunch and had the Sushi Lunch where you get four rolls, chef's choice and those blasted California rolls. Overall, incredibly average. I've had better, I've had worse. The chef's sushi selection was decent for the usual suspects, tuna, salmon, mackerel sort of thing. As in, he didn't go out of his way to thrill me. The rice was okay. Consistency was off, little mushy as if it had been formed for 30 seconds too long. Otherwise, I had a pretty good lunch for a very reasonable price. The sushi isn't good enough to eat alone , so bring some good company along and you won't notice."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I love visiting this sushi bar when I'm in the Madison area. The staff is really nice, the sushi chefs are friendly and funny, and the food is delicious. Try the Badger roll - you won't be disappointed! :D"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,Takara has lots of menu options to try. Hibachi grill is a great way to introduce the family to a sushi house. I love to sit at the counter and watch the chefs prepare the rolls myself. Some entertain while you drink saki and eat sashimi.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara and Ginza are my favorite sushi places in Madison. I can't speak for Takara's other dishes, just the sushi. They have a spicy tuna roll that's wrapped in cucumber instead of rice - fantastic. I've also gotten the ""love boat"" before, which is a huge boat filled with chefs choice. All very delicious."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Madison and has been for years.  Yes, I've tried Sushi Box.  No, I don't care that the sushi is more 'authentic,' and therefore, 'better.'  I love my Americanized maki!  Put some more avocado and cream cheese on that shit!  ;)

Seriously, though, I am a big fan of their sushi rolls.  I particularly like the Shogun Roll and Spicy Tuna.  I love that their menu says ""Special Roll for Special Customer.""  :D  They have an excellent lunch special, if I'm remembering correctly.  Their entrees are good, too.

I really enjoy the atmosphere (usually quiet, even if there are lots of people), and the service (friendly, attentive and polite).  

One day, out of nowhere (and much to my chagrin), a roach crawled up on my table!  Nothing could've blown my mind more, because this place just looks so clean!  I alerted a waitress, who FREAKED out.  She and several other waitresses had a small shit fit and managed to capture the roach and get rid of it.  They apologized profusely and were so embarrassed.  I am *positive* that the roach mosied on over from the ultra-scuzzy Pizza Di Roma next door.  Still, it's worth mentioning, just in case they really do have roaches.  :)  I'd still go back, though!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"California Roll and Spicy Spider sushi was very good! Also ordered Yaki udon, the WORST udon noodles I've ever had!! They were completely mushy and the vegetables had an acrid taste. Told the waiter immediately to take it away that I did not like it--STILL CHARGED ME FULL PRICE!!! They get 2 stars for sushi, I do NOT recommend."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Outstanding service, nice interior, disappointing food. The tempura was greasy and tasted as though the oil in the fryer hadn't been changed in a while. The sushi was ice cold, a dead giveaway that it wasn't freshly prepared. Prices are reasonable given the amount of food, but don't expect great quality, at least not at lunch."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Sushi was good, not great. The location is great and the hibachi grills are always fun for groups."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,We've been coming to Takara for years - best sushi in town with a friendly staff.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"My favourite sushi/ sashimi place in town. They definitely have the best selection of sushi, which regularly serving rare treats like mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) and toro. I won't say their cooked food and sometimes the sushi are really top notch, but considering we are in madison and faraway from any japanese settlement, I consider they do a pretty good job"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"THIS PLACE HAS EVERYTHING!!  Udon, sushi, and HIBACHI!  Seating at sushi bar, regular tables, habachi bar, and on the floor Japanese cushioned seated tables.  All quite good.  And chefs of all ethnicities... so multicultural, this place has it all.

Pros: cheaper and better tasting that Muramoto, also more Asian people, the lunch special
Cons: stains on plating, sticky tables, a lot of oil in hibachi"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I really like their sushi. The rice is of the right consistency and flavour, the fish is tasty and fresh, and it is the only place where I have had conch and sea urchin."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I came to give this place a second chance, and I shouldn't have done so. The service was terrible! I made reservations to sit at the hibachi grill and upon being seated, my boyfriend and I were seated at the back of the grill that was filled by a group of 10. (We basically looked at the backside of the chef). That being said, we didn't get to see anything the chef was doing while cooking our food. Furthermore, our waitress asked our order at the beginning of the night, yet never returned to ask for refills on drinks etc.  The appetizer sushi roll or ordered came right as dinner was being served. I'm very upset with the lack of service that we received at this establishment. I will not be returning and hope that those that brace this place don't experience the poor service that o received."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Took my good friend Sara here on a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area. 

I couldn't be happier with the experience we had. The edamame was excellent, the vegetable tempura was amazing and the hibachi was very good. 

We walked in hungry and left full and very pleased. 

The service was excellent as well.

Can't wait to come back to mad-town and try some of their sushi!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"The lunch sets are a good deal and habachi display is cool.  I find this place too expensive,especially after another Japanese restaurant called Osaka opened a few blocks away which offers a variety of sushi and bento box for a more reasonable price,quality is a little inferior of course but well worth your money."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Had a terrific dinner here while visiting Madison.  I really enjoyed my sushi, and my wife had a great Bento Box."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Vegetable tempura was enjoyable, and the rolls that came with vegetable sushi entree that contained fried vegetables were very tasty. Otherwise, I thought the food was just ok. I ordered a salad and it was dressing with a little bit of lettuce. Good service and it was fun to watch the sushi chefs perform their art."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 

Shame on me. I went here twice. Big big mistake. Well, not that big, since it's reasonably priced, but damn, I could have gotten better sushi from the grocery store. 

I went here three years ago. I don't at all recall what I got. It was likely something on the sushi spectrum. I recall a vague mental note-to-self saying ""don't go to that place again"". 

I went here earlier this week and kept it simple: a California roll and a spicy tuna. C'mon, who could make these things unpleasant? They're usually so good, so dependable. While they were certainly edible, they weren't *good*. The spicy tuna maki was a gelatinous blob surrounded by rice and the California roll did was much too heavy on the mayonnaise and much too light on the avocado. I really did not find either to be worthwhile. I did, however, try some of my friend's tempura bento box, which had some nicely done tempura-ed vegetables. 

Overall, it wasn't all bad. The service was a little too eager, but very polite and attentive, which is refreshing."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Was it the best sushi I've ever had? No. Will I be back anyways? Yes. 

Came here with a friend last night (Thursday) after failing to get a table at Red. The ambiance is what you'd expect at a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant. A little tacky but it works. Our service was fine and pretty quick. A little less than half of the restaurant was full so that was probably part of the reason. 

Their house wine was not very good. I know I should expect that when paying $4 for a glass of wine, but I've had better for the same price. However our rolls were delicious. Between the two of us we had the spicy tuna roll, shogun roll and salmon and avocado roll. Everything was fresh and tasted very good. We finished it all within about 15 minutes!

I noticed they also do hibachi, I'll be anxious to try that next time I'm in.

Overall, a fine place to go for some reasonably priced sushi and/or Japanese food. I will be back!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"If you're a sushi enthusiast like myself, then this is the place for you.

The sushi is extremely fresh and well made. The prices are reasonable, ranging anywhere from ~$4 for basic rolls to ~$12 for fancier ones. 2 orders will definitely fill you up, so I recommend bringing a few friends and ordering a couple to share amongst yourselves. 

You can't really go wrong with any of the sushi, but I personally liked the Naruto, Philadelphia Roll and Fashion Maki.

If you're not in the mood for sushi, they also offer a wide selection of hibachi. Now keep in mind that the hibachi comes with salad, soup and rice, so only order it if you're really, really hungry. Also, it's doused in soy sauce, so if that's not your jam, request less sauce. 

The service is a bit slow (roughly 30-40 minutes, depending on the size of the party), but the food is definitely worth it.

I will definitely be frequenting this place quite often. 

PS: They also offer sake bombs!!111shiftone!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I've eaten here for lunch before and the service was reasonable. For some reason, arriving close to 6pm on a Friday night yielded really subpar service - and the food took over 40 minutes to arrive.   

The salmon bento box was nicely grilled.  Shumai dumplings that go with the bento could be much improved.  The tempura was nicely done."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I really should give up on sushi in Madison. I really miss the interesting things people came up with for GOOD vegetarian rolls. Takara only offered the very basic rolls (vegetable tempura, avocado, kampyo, nato, cucumber) and my whole meal was just boring.

And stale.

Derek ordered the Fancy Salmon roll and I ordered the vegetable tempura. It seems like a sushi roll that has been deep fried in tempura batter couldn't mess up, but both of ours were stale. I bit into mine and could barely chomp through. HOW ROMANTIC. We just went there last night and I don't remember anything else we got.

Our waiter and waitress were pretty awkward and shy, and obviously not interested in us at all. No smiles, all business. I did see them smile when the 4 girls there to begin their friend's 21st birthday party got crazy during the Happy Birthday song. They actually were the only thing making me smile (besides my fiance across from me) because they did seem so happy to be sake bombing.  It made me want to re-celebrate my 21st birthday!

So, yeah, I wouldn't bother again. I think if we want sushi here, we'll go to Wasabi next time."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,Good sushi with a reasonable price. Takara is extremely generous with their food and their staff are always very friendly.
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Ordered some rolls to go for lunch. Per my online order receipt, I ordered tekka and sake, but ended up a sake and alaskan roll instead. Didn't notice it until I was already back at the office. I'm not a fan of wasabi being in a regular sake roll, either. Even if it is more ""authentic,"" I'd rather it be an option on the side. Overall, wasn't terrible sushi, but the cheaper, more ""express"" places around campus seem to offer the same taste/quality, so I'll probably choose them for a quick sushi fix in the future."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Sushi here was really good, go for the crunchy shrimp. The Katsu Don was average, not anything special. Restaurant is owned chinese people, not authentic Japanese."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"This place was good, and I enjoyed my meal here. I had the edamame, ginger salad, and a sushi combo of spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy california rolls. 

The rolls were pretty good; I like to dip my sushi into more spicy mayo, and I think I'd come back for this combo again. It wasn't anything spectacular or special that I would die to try again, but I enjoyed it. The salad was just a little off to me. The greens were drowned in a thick garlic sauce, and I saw myself digging to find lettuce that wasn't covered in it. I did not enjoy the salad, so I think I'll ask for the soup next time.

The restaurant looked pretty small, but the environment was cute and cozy. I liked hearing the chefs in the background cooking. Overall, I can see myself enjoying this place with a large group of people if we sat in the back with the flat stove top."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"The sushi here is great! It's fresh and compared to the other sushi restaurant on State St they actually make it correctly and worth the money it is on the menu.

The wait are friendly but they seem generally disinterested. Of course they also sat me at the sushi bar were they pick up the sushi orders and I kept having to lean out of the way for them to get food. Also, of the three people on staff for the wait staff were taking turns sitting in the far corner rolling utensils while the third answered the phones and generally ignored the patrons in the restaurant. However, I do appreciate the not overly attentive staff compared to some other sushi restaurants I've been to. 

Overall I think I'll be going here more often to see if it's any different the second time, but I wasn't overly impress with my first visit."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I can always count on Takara to deliver good, quick, and affordable sushi!

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a california roll, and the calamari appetizer. My husband and I both agreed that we should have skipped the calamari and got another roll. Our friends got spicy salmon & a rainbow roll & they loved their selections as well.

Surprisingly good: the old fashioned. My husband ordered it as a bit of a joke (not expecting a great old fashioned at a Japanese restaurant), but he was happy with it. We've definitely had worse!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Visited my sister this weekend and we were really looking forward to getting sushi at Red. We walked in and there was a 1 1/2 hour wait and we were starving so we decided to go to Takara instead. Bad idea, first off, we were sat next to the fountain and it smelled so bad, like a dirty fish tank. The edamame was decent, some of it had gone brown, but tasted alright. We got a spicy tuna roll and some specialty roll, the tuna roll had some ""brownage""going on which kinda worried us, but we were starving so we ate it, definitely not great sushi by any means. All we cared about was not getting food poisoning. We lucked out, felt fine the rest of the evening, but our clothes wreaked of a cheap China Buffett the rest of the night out, barf! So overall, never would I go to this place again!!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I've eaten at a few hibachi spots and I have to say this one just might have topped them all. Go figure! In Madison, of all places.

The man and I were the only two sitting at the grill and we were surprised to find that the chef still went above and beyond despite only having us as an audience. He was definitely determined to get that onion volcano going even though we didn't really care if he did or not since we've seen it a million times. But after 4 or 5 times, he finally got it. He was very entertaining and his jokes were cheesy but made us laugh. Spinning an egg on the grill and calling it an ""egg roll?"" Ha-ha!

The portion of the food was ginormous for the both of us. The vegetables themselves seemed like it could've been split to more than 2 portions. We ordered the filet mignon, shrimp, salmon, and chicken....all of which we dipped in the amaaaaaaazing seafood sauce. And the chef even gave us extra before he left.

The only thing we didn't like was that it was $2.95 for fried rice. Eh? I guess I'm used to it being included back home in L.A. Oh well.

Love the hibachi experience here. Haven't tried the sushi yet. One day!"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Takara was my introduction to sushi. I never ate in the restaurant, but my roommate** and I ordered take-out quite a lot. My favorite thing was to bring sushi up to Concerts on the Square in the summer. 

For those who are also getting their sushi education at Takara, I highly recommend their veggie tempura roll. I would still order that today, even now that I will eat practically any fish, raw or cooked (my education was expedited when I worked at a sushi bar after college).

Hibachi will cost you, but Takara is really cheap for sushi. It didn't seem like it on a student's budget, I know. To put it in perspective, In Minneapolis (which isn't even an expensive city), a big specialty roll can run close to $20 -- at Takara, nothing is over $14. Their two- or three-roll lunch specials... I don't even wanna talk about it. Be thankful, Madison. Damned thankful.

**My college roommate could eat wasabi by the handful."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"Just had lunch at Takara and I was thoroughly impressed. I'm from out of town and needed a great sushi place close to campus. Slim chance, right?  WRONG!  

Starts with great ambiance. Traditional Japanese art and design concepts. Very soothing. Excellent lunch specials too. 3 delicious rolls for under $15!  Try the Alaska, spicy tuna, and tuna & salmon rolls. Very fresh, good presentation. 

Highly recommend for anyone on the UW campus or in Madison."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"I took my girlfriend here for lunch and I found hair in my salad and our sushi was bland.. we got five different rolls to split and none of them had very much flavor... even the two spicy rolls we got weren't spicy at all.. It was really disappointing.. It wasn't worth paying 40 dollars for, I've had better sushi from the grocery store"
Takara Japanese Restaurant,sushi lunch,"My wife and I went here tonight after previously going to Takara's other location on the west side of town. Both times, I have walked away pretty impressed with the sushi there.

Full disclosure: I am by NO means a sushi connoisseur, or even someone who knows much about sushi. When we go out for sushi, my wife usually just orders a variety of rolls and I sample everything.

However, I have eaten at a handful of different sushi joints, and Takara has consistently been one of the better ones I've sampled. The service was blisteringly quick, the drinks were pretty good, and the sushi was excellent. 

We will definitely be back!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"Fish tacos during lunch here a couple months ago. I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from it. The fish tasted a little funky and against my better judgement, consumed it. Knocked out for 2 days solid. To boot, I think I paid 12 dollars for it."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"I usually go to Francisco's during my late night food binges. I have to say I really love their steak sopes! The sopes come topped with tomato, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. They are like little boats of fried goodness topped with juicy, tender meat and toppings. Make sure to ask for their spicy homemade salsa that they have in squirt bottles. It has a real nice kick to it. Everything else on the menu is pretty decent. My favorites are mostly the ala carte items: tostadas, tacos, and sopes. I don't really care for the rice and beans that most of the entrees come with. If you do stop in for a weekend late night snack, then be ready to expect a busy restaurant!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"I heard this is a shoot off of Guadelajara, my favorite place ever.... They need to up their game at Francisco's. The tacos were tough and really just not the same. The food seems like there's an overdose of sour cream everywhere. Even though they are open until 3am and serving lots of drunk people, they are slipping."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"Good. It's a nice cheery and spacious interior, and the food is extremely affordable. They have possibly the cheapest tacos in town and they do it right (2 corn tortillas, cilantro, onion). The steak was of decent quality, pastor was largely fat and grizzle, very disappointing, but sometimes you just get the unlucky serving. They could really sear the meat more, as the best taco happens when protein is charred and then dowsed in vinegar, citrus, and peppers. Salsa was OK. Overall worth a visit, especially after a few drinks, but there are better taquerias in town."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"Stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon after the farmer's market.  My wife had fish tacos and I had a chimichanga.  Food was delicious, loved the bit of spicy sausage in mine.  Chips and salsa was great, service was fast and friendly, we will check this place out again when we are in town."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"Some of the best Mexican food in the city, and they serve proper mole. Their tortilla soup is wonderful, their tacos are phenomenal, their enchiladas top notch. Great, authentic Mexican."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"The tacos, while having good flavor, were seriously lacking on quantity of meat. Ordered 3 and the meat in all of them could have fit easily in 1 small tortilla.  For $2 each you can get much better tacos at Tex Tubb's. Margarita was standard. Would have been 2 stars but the service was really good."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"My tacos were authentic and delicious! The margaritas were SUPER strong and affordable. They even let me drink for free since it was my bachelorette party. I didn't realize how small the restaurant was, but that didn't change the quality of my experience at all. I would definitely come back. You probably would want to make a reservation for Friday and Saturday nights, though."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"This place definitely has a mantra: quick, delicious, and inexpensive. 

The steak tacos were perfect and less than $2 each, margaritas were made with fresh lime juice, sides were solid, and their house hot sauce was also very good. The salsa was a little watery but tasty. The location is convenient as well."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"First, let me say this: so, so much more convenient than venturing down S. Park St. to Tacqueria Guadelajara. It's owned by the owner's (of TG) nephew, but the location is so much more convenient! Prices are pretty cheap ($1.70/taco) and the food is excellent. If you go at lunch, you may be lucky enough to see Francisco, who came out and chatted with us last time we were there. Delicious chips and salsa, and they came with free tortilla soup!

Oh, but the food...the tacos were excellent. Personally, my favorite was the pastor, but the chorizo/chicken/steak were all superb. I've had just about everything on the menu, and it's all great. Highly recommended!

UPDATE: Docking Francisco's a star. The food is good, but after going to La Guanajuatance? Francisco's is simply mediocre."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"The current plethora of restaurants in this category makes for a competitive field here in Madison.  While the menu selection rings of authenticity and the location allows for convenience as a destination for the inebriated college demographic in the late hours, the food itself is selectively pedestrian.   On a positive note, certain items like the burrito suizo give the patron a nice composite taste which is tied to this popular genre.  At the end of the day however,  a restaurant must go the extra mile to distinguish itself from it's competition, and that is something this place needs to consider.  On a recent late night visit, I ordered the enchilada, which, for $6.49 came across as a meager version of what I have had at other competitive restaurants.  Another time, I picked up some tacos to go-although they met the bar with regard to taste and quality, there was nothing about them that stood out above the competition (with the exception of the hot sauce which accompanied the order).
While I haven't written the place off, on my next visit, I will make it a point to add accessory items such as avocado and cilantro."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"I've eaten here a few times recently, mostly because of some deals via an iPhone app. It's been really delicious!

I've had their tacos several times, and they really do hit the spot. The chicken and chorizo tacos are probably  my favorite, but the steak is fine too. The chips that are placed on your table are good, as is the salsa.

Their patio is very nice, with a good amount of seating available. A nice spot to sit and eat tacos, maybe have a couple beers. Even without any sort of promotion, the prices are decent. 

Also, the staff at Francisco's is great! Very friendly folks, who are attentive and simply do a great job."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"I'm from Madison and I have a home there, but I have lived in the Mission District in San Francisco (where the burrito as we know it was invented) since 1997. I live a block from La Taqueria on Mission Street which, according to many people, is one of the top taquerias on the West Coast. I'm not boasting - I'm just establishing my Mexican food eater cred. Brothers and sisters, I know tacos.

I met a buddy there from lunch. He recommended we meet there. I'd never heard of Francisco's before then. My buddy grew up in Mexico City, then moved to Madison for college - and stayed. He's a helluva good judge of Mexican food.

Anyway, I've eaten at Francisco's  Mexican Cantina twice now in two days and I can totally couch for their tacos. Very good, authentic, delicious tacos. They feature generous meat portions - I recommend the Carne Asada, the Pastor, and Beef Tongue, cilantro and onions on two thick, tender tortillas. Their salsa verde has a little heat, but not at all too much, and I recommend it.

The chips and salsa are the real deal. I've even had the Flan and it was also very good.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the platos and more specialty items, but I have been jonesing for tacos.

Great food.

Excellent service.

Great value for money.

Highly recommended!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"Their fish tacos were a solid B+, meat was under seasoned but the avocado and tortillas were divine. The service was slow and standoffish, which as far as I'm concerned make it a great lunch hideaway on a busy day. Sit at the bar and contemplate the tile as you enjoy the chunky salsa and really good chips. Will return!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month.
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,Chips and Salsa was acceptable.  Service was good. But I came for the tacos and they sucked. The hunt continues to find badass tacos in Madison
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,tacos dorados,"My go to for tacos! Super nice staff, they remember my order, keep me well stocked with chips and drink! Everything I've has here is above average and fresh !!!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,"I've only gotten delivery from Francisco's, but it's been a great experience all three times. Great chicken enchiladas. I'd definitely recommend this place!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,"Great food, good prices.  Nothing not to like.

I had their enchiladas and it was definitely enough food.  They also have different daily specials and they deliver."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,"Food is okay . Basic Mexican food not bad Francisco cooks Mexico City type cuisine.

I had a business lunch and ordered the shrimp enchiladas.  Shrimp was grainy, either they weren't cleaned correctly or were poor quality.  Other than that the enchiladas were okay.  I wouldn't order them again.

His aunt owns Guadalajara on Park St. That food there has always been delicious.  They cook northern Mexican style cuisine and they use El  Milagro tortillas from Chicago, the best!  Unfortunately for me, there was a fire a couple of weeks ago.  When they rebuild Check them out and compare,  you will be glad you did."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,"This is a pretty solid Mexican option. It is close to the Capitol Building, so it's pretty centrally located. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The chips and salsa are great, but they are even better if you order queso sauce as well! Margaritas were good. I tried the seafood enchiladas, which were very good. My friends liked their food too. I would definitely go back for some good Mexican."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,"I really don't understand the hype. Or maybe I just picked a bad day.  I ordered the traditional enchiladas and a tamale. My food was cold and part of the order was wrong. I love mole sauce but theirs tasted awful - too sweet, cold and no genuine spices. The chicken tamale was dry and hard.  I also ordered a side of beans - they were bland and coming out of the styrofoam box (they have to know that they would spill out-why not use something with a lid???) The place was almost empty yet the food seemed rushed and the staff were not very welcoming.  I stopped here because it was close but next time I'll travel. Usually I'm into second chances...not so much for this place. I won't be back."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,"Spiffy (anytime I use a word that ends with a ""y"", as in ""nifty"" or ""flashy"" I feel it is a man-card violation.  Not a red card, probably just a yellow card...but a violation nontheless) little (arguably another minor man-card violation...things must be bold and brawny, not little...too cutsie) Mexican joint that offered a heckuva (now that word definitely connotes manliness) deal on a plate of tasty (damn did it again) enchiladas.  Margheritas (now I did it...I should be drinking bourbon) were solid as well.  I mean, they were liquid, but solid."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,The food here is amazing!  It has a very comfortable atmosphere and the staff is very friendly.  I'm a pain in the butt and prefer flour tortillas with my enchiladas and they are always more than willing to accommodate!  Very authentic.
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas vallarta,"I've been here a lot for the lunch specials. This is not the top Mexican joint in Madison by any means, but they have a nice straightforward menu, good food and prompt servers. Food is always hot, and while the portions are a little small, they will still fill you up. Can personally recommend the chimichangas, enchiladas and the margaritas. Corona with a lime to top it off, and reasonably priced."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Coming from California, I've been suffering from carne asada fries withdrawals. I honestly had no idea this was a west coast thing, correct me if I'm wrong. After sifting through Yelp, we found out that this place served Carne Asada Fries. I was on a mission to try these, of course!! The first time we went, they didn't have any potatoes so I just got a chimichanga, which was good! The second time my SO and I came here, it was on another Sunday afternoon and we ordered right away. 

The chips and salsa they served us was quite good, and it had the right amount of heat for a spicy/hot food sensitive gal like me. We got sopes as an appetizer and our server was extremely awesome and got us two even though I had only ordered one. The sopes tasted so good that we were contemplating getting two more, until our fries came! They use freshly made crinkle fries and top it off with carne asada, melted cheese, pico de gallo, guac, and I had them add shredded cheese and sour cream on mine. It wasn't mind blowing but it was still pretty darn good! 

I'm officially a regular because of this lone menu item. If any Yelpers know of any other place that serves Carne Asada Fries, do let me know! :)"

Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Many of my prayers for the Madison restaurant scene - finally answered

There will probably be some confusion at first as The Isthmus recently mentioned this restaurant, calling it Juquila.  However after chatting with Francisco himself last night, it's going to be called Francisco's Cantina for time being, as that's the name on the liquor license.  Asi es la vida.  

What's not confusing is the food and liquor.  It's a god send.  It's got the freaking trifecta:  (1) delicious (2) cheap (3) likely open after bar time (or your shift if you work in the industry).  Item (3) will become a reality soon when the man gets some more help in the kitchen.

I shared drinks and dinner with a good friend around 10pm last night.  We had the requisite chips and salsa.  A massive (had to weigh 5lbs) steak burrito with house-made mole negro and a plate with assorted, chicken filled, verde/rojo tamales.  We washed down said food with half a dozen shots of Camarena Blanco and cuatro Bohemias.

Total bill:  $41.  Seriously!  Why go anywhere else?  

Now it's time we all thank Francisco and our respective deities for gifting us an amazing restaurant that doesn't close at 9pm.  Go support this guy and his food else I'm gonna be mad at you Madison."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Amazing.  Hands down. 

Hits: every food item, tight knit family joint, personable service

Misses: Upcharge for extra chips 

Hints: go with the house margarita.  It's cheap and tasty."

Starting with the salsa, to guac, to tacos, to chile rillenos- this place is good. I also love the cheese dip they offer- omg the cheese dip. So yummy. It is also in a great location and is open late night which is a huge plus! Highly recommend this place!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Yum! Very similar to other Mexican places around, except with a little more flavor. (Pretty sure there's lard in those beans.) and so cheap! We almost felt bad using our Bucky Book coupon. The one down side - SO LOUD. Tall space, brick walls, open door, and full of people. We could barely hear each other talk."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"This is THE place to go if you're on the East side of the square at bar time and you're hungry. The food is very good, it's cheap, and they're open very late.

Don't go here if you've only got 20 minutes--you'll be waiting a while for the food.  But the staff are great, and as I said, the food's even better.  So far, I haven't found a better spot for mole in Madison.  Also?  The portions are pretty huge.

Sometimes it can get pretty loud (well duh--it's a restaurant that caters to the late-night crowd).  Someday I'll have to try it during regular hours..."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"I've been there two times, both times I've had about a 7/10 experience. Their food is really good, I've always enjoyed what I've gotten. Their grande burrito is humongous & pretty cheap for what you get. They ran out of chimichangas  last time so I got the sobres I think it's called-which were really good.

The complimentary chips were cold last time I went there (granted they were busy) & they won't give you refills on chips unless you pay- so if you have a large group or a few hungry friends expect to pay more.

The margarita my sister & I split tasted like strawberry soda with a cup of sugar added in. So pretty darn sweet. 

All in all, good place to try near the Capitol & relatively affordable. I recommend."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"My first Blah review while in Madison

This place was recommended by the mixologist at Merchant. I wanted faijatas  and they said this was the place to go. We walk in and sit at the bar. For a place that's supposed to be real good there wasn't a lot of people inside. Maybe 2 tables and a couple at the bar. Mind you this was a Saturday Night around 6ish. Even my wife mentioned something about hardly anyone being here. My wife gets a lime Margarita and I get a Sol Beer. They pour her margarita from a pitcher that was inside a small refrigerator behind the bar. Now maybe I've been spoiled while visiting your town with all these made from scratch drinks but to see this was disappointing. To be fair, my wife said she liked it. 

 I order the chicken and shrimp fajitas with extra shrimp and extra tortillas. All to go. My order comes up and I double check it. It's missing the extra tortillas, which I was not happy about, and the sour cream and guacamole looks a little small so I want another one.  I tell the server and he brings me both items and says the guacamole etc was on the house for the mixup. That was cool. We call our hotel and they come pick us up. 

Service

I want to back up here and mention this. This was the first place we went to that the servers were not friendly. The one bigger guy looked like he didn't want to be there and didn't crack a smile once. The other one was eating behind the bar when we walked in and wasn't friendly either. Now if you two servers are reading this I want you to pay attention. I'm not asking you to walk around the restaurant like the joker with a smile permanently fixed on your face. But you should greet your customers with a smile and introduce yourself. It wasn't busy. It's called being a professional.  Make a damn effort is all I say. 

Food

The was nothing outstanding about these fajitas . It came with corn tortillas which I hate. I like the flour ones. Also it came with no cheese. The horror! Never had a fajita that didn't come with cheese on the side. Isn't NO cheese a crime in Wisconsin?  These were no different than Applebee's or Chilis. Honestly Chilis make a better fajitas than this joint. 

Verdict 

Go somewhere else. I think that about sums it up LOL Stay Hungry!"

Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"I'd give 3.5 but my 3stars are usually just another way of saying average eyyy.

It's been said. CHEAP, QUICK, & Good. 
I won't order the Seafood Chimmy again. The other Yelper got a lot of shrimp & no crab. I got the whole pkg of crab & 3 shrimps. But my former boss plate looked superb. 

Seat yourself. Chips & salsa upon sitting * all (soft)drinks come from the bar wand - I get water but noticed 12pk of Mt. Dew under the cabinet* LUNCH fills up quick * We were served some spaghetti/noodle dish after chips & salsa but before ordering. I tried it & it's nothing I'd make a priority for but it's a sweet gesture. 

MADISON SHOULD GET READY FOR  A STAND IN LINE PLACE AND WAIT TO BE SEATED. I'm glad we've got a place downtown now I don't have to trek over to Guadalajara on Park but I still had to walk my lunch off. I didn't bring home anything (e.g. as in I ate it all right there, lol sad but true)."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Don't let the mexican music and decor fool you. Place has no passion in its food.  Waitress was nice just doing her job. But food and presentation sub-par.

Food I ordered:

Salsa and chips: salsa was good but chips were a little stale. Use to getting warm fresh chips.

Shrimp Ceviche: Wow. Nothing close to what i grew up eating. I know people make it differently. I'm use to eating it with like a tomato juice and have a sweet tangy taste to it. This was more like a pico de gallo with shrimp, and avocados didn't look to fresh. Overall alright just because I like pico de gallo. But I did not order pico de gallo it was to be ceviche.

Torta with carne asada: Tried ordering the milanese meat(breaded steak). They did not have it and it was on the menu. How do you not have milanese at mex restaurant and it looked really slow that night. So I ordered it with carne asada. It was good just not up there on the top list of best tortas I've ever had. Lol. Not alot of savor(flavor) or passion. I will try other hispanic joints. Gracias."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Easily my favorite Mexican spot in Madison. 
I know that's a controversial opinion, but allow me to explain.

First of all, the prices are fantastic. They may not be the cheapest in Madison, but they must be close.
Also, my boyfriend and I have become regulars (almost every other Friday night). The servers/owners are such sweet people and we really like supporting their business.

The salsa is homemade and pretty delicious. The only downside is they charge for a refill.
Their margarita pitchers can't be beat - for $13, they fill 4 full glasses, and they're definitely not weak.
I always order the Quesadilla Supreme. It's the only thing I've tried on their menu, but man is it tasty! Cooked perfectly with generous filling. The sour cream/guac portions look small, but I never end up wishing I had more.
My boyfriend orders a Burrito, plus a Gordita when he's really hungry, and it always fills him up (and he's a huge dude).

With chips & salsa, our meals, plus a pitcher of margarita, our total (including tax & tip) is usually about $38. Super reasonable!

For me, what separates this place from other Mexican restaurants in Madison is the ambiance & location. It's right by the capital and has a chill, non-pretentious atmosphere. Also, It's usually very easy to get a table.
Give this place a shot!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"This Mexican restaurant is pretty awesome for the Madison scene. My boyfriend and I frequent this place, and we have never been disappointed. The prices are great, and the food is tasty and filling. I usually get the burrito suizo, and the cheese sauce is amazing!! My boyfriend gets the quesadilla with a side of guac and always leaves happy. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great inexpensive Mexican!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,Only thing I would add as a negative no one ever came back to refill my drink or the chips kinda disappointed in that
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"This is a pretty solid Mexican option. It is close to the Capitol Building, so it's pretty centrally located. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The chips and salsa are great, but they are even better if you order queso sauce as well! Margaritas were good. I tried the seafood enchiladas, which were very good. My friends liked their food too. I would definitely go back for some good Mexican."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. An inexpensive, no frills Mexican restaurant near the square. Margaritas come in a pint glass and are not overly sweet. Plus, mine had real lemon pieces in it, so it's better than your average made-from-concentrate restaurant margarita. The food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either - especially for the price. One standout was the salsa. It was clearly fresh and you could taste the cilantro. It's definitely worth a visit if you are looking for Mexican food downtown and the food carts aren't out!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"We wanted chips, salsa, and margaritas. It was a small request for a dining experience, but one we have had a hard time finding in Madison. Diving right into our basics.

Chips - Meh
Salsa - Okay
Margaritas - Made whenever and just okay

The margaritas actually were poured from a pitched behind the bar like kool-aid instead of being made fresh. Better than a mix, but not a promising start. The fajitas were just okay with the steak being more jerky than meat and the burrito mostly lettuce with a side of chicken. We won't be back unless the other mexican places in town are just as bad."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"I've eaten here a few times recently, mostly because of some deals via an iPhone app. It's been really delicious!

I've had their tacos several times, and they really do hit the spot. The chicken and chorizo tacos are probably  my favorite, but the steak is fine too. The chips that are placed on your table are good, as is the salsa.

Their patio is very nice, with a good amount of seating available. A nice spot to sit and eat tacos, maybe have a couple beers. Even without any sort of promotion, the prices are decent. 

Also, the staff at Francisco's is great! Very friendly folks, who are attentive and simply do a great job."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"We tried Franciso's Cantina on a recent Friday night. It's not a large space and it was only about 50% full. The restrooms are actually in a hallway out the backdoor and are shared by the restaurants/bars on either side. The space was clean although we did notice some cleaning supplies hanging out on some high-shelves that looked like someone forgot to put them away.

We were seated immediately and a server came by to bring us menus and take our drink orders. It's not a huge menu, but has most of the traditional Tex-Mex items we expect. Our server brought chips and salsa and took our food order. The salsa was fresh and light. The chips were dense and crunchy. There were noticeably fewer chips than at many Mexican restaurants, but still plenty to satisfy.

For dinner we had the tamales and the Carne Asada. The Carne Asada had great flavors. The meat was a little tough to bite through. Beans and rice were all fine. Lettuce, pico, and guacamole were all fresh. The tamales had a delicious sauce and didn't suffer from too much masa. The portion sizes again seemed a mite small by American standards but considering the reasonable prices I have no complaints.

It did take an unusually long time for our server to bring our bill. Especially since she came by and said ""I'll bring you your check."", but then it took quite awhile after that to actually get it.

All in all, I would not hesitate to return if someone wanted to eat here or I happened to be walking by. I wouldn't make a specific effort to back though either. The food was tasty, the portions were small, the prices were reasonable, the service was mixed."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"I really don't understand the hype. Or maybe I just picked a bad day.  I ordered the traditional enchiladas and a tamale. My food was cold and part of the order was wrong. I love mole sauce but theirs tasted awful - too sweet, cold and no genuine spices. The chicken tamale was dry and hard.  I also ordered a side of beans - they were bland and coming out of the styrofoam box (they have to know that they would spill out-why not use something with a lid???) The place was almost empty yet the food seemed rushed and the staff were not very welcoming.  I stopped here because it was close but next time I'll travel. Usually I'm into second chances...not so much for this place. I won't be back."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"I'm from Madison and I have a home there, but I have lived in the Mission District in San Francisco (where the burrito as we know it was invented) since 1997. I live a block from La Taqueria on Mission Street which, according to many people, is one of the top taquerias on the West Coast. I'm not boasting - I'm just establishing my Mexican food eater cred. Brothers and sisters, I know tacos.

I met a buddy there from lunch. He recommended we meet there. I'd never heard of Francisco's before then. My buddy grew up in Mexico City, then moved to Madison for college - and stayed. He's a helluva good judge of Mexican food.

Anyway, I've eaten at Francisco's  Mexican Cantina twice now in two days and I can totally couch for their tacos. Very good, authentic, delicious tacos. They feature generous meat portions - I recommend the Carne Asada, the Pastor, and Beef Tongue, cilantro and onions on two thick, tender tortillas. Their salsa verde has a little heat, but not at all too much, and I recommend it.

The chips and salsa are the real deal. I've even had the Flan and it was also very good.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the platos and more specialty items, but I have been jonesing for tacos.

Great food.

Excellent service.

Great value for money.

Highly recommended!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"We decided to check this place out due to the yelp stars. We got a table for 4 inside by the window right away. The server was rushing around. Well we soon realized she was the only server for inside, outside and was also the bartender. It was soooo crazy. We started with ordering guacamole and the bean dip. She brought us the chips and dips, no salsa. The dips were just ok. The bean dip not impressive at all. The chips lacked flavor and needed salt. We all enjoyed our meals but the service was literally 1 star. Why do they only have one server to run the entire restaurant on a Thursday night??? We felt like we could not ask for anything...all we wanted was some chips and salsa and she gave a look like she could not believe we were asking her. Oh and when the meal came we asked for napkins and when she delivered them she threw them in the middle on top of our chips. Service this horrible makes for a bad night out. It really ruined our experience and it is a bummer too because we were really looking forward to this place. The main meals were good but just not enjoyable with the overall experience. Very disappointed."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Why anyone would go to Pasqual's while this place exists is beyond me. This typical Mexican place is priced affordably. The food is not anything that will blow your mind, but it's good. Really good. I had the burrito suizo, and found it to hit about every Mexican craving I get twice a week. Meat, beans and rice? Check. A rich and gooey cheese sauce layered over everything? Check. I ordered a side of pico de gallo and layered that on every bite to have as delicious of am Mexican experience as I've had anywhere in Madison.

If you're in the downtown area, it's hard to find better Mexican than this."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Went to grab a quick lunch here with a friend last Friday.  We were luckily seated right away as it was pretty busy.  The first basket of chips and salsa is free, but any past that is extra.  I feel like it's pretty rare to find Mexican restaurants that charge for chips and salsa these days.  For drinks, I asked what they had (as the menu did not specify), and when I asked if they had horchata, the guy nodded and said ""horchata, ok.""  
When our food came out 20-30 minutes later, I still had not received my horchata.  When I asked the waitress who delivered our food about it, she checked with the guy who took my order and then said that they didn't have horchata.  Fine, but you could have told me that when I first ordered, or checked on it and come back to let me know so I could potentially order something else. 
When they checked on our food, I asked for extra sour cream.  I waited a couple minutes for it to arrive, but then kept eating cause I was hungry.  I never received that sour cream.

On the plus side, the food was well portioned for the price and pretty tasty.  But the service could really stand to improve.  You're a restaurant on the square, you know you're busy weekday lunches, add more staff!  
I'm disappointed and probably won't be back.  There are other inexpensive Mexican joints that have much better service."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,"Their fish tacos were a solid B+, meat was under seasoned but the avocado and tortillas were divine. The service was slow and standoffish, which as far as I'm concerned make it a great lunch hideaway on a busy day. Sit at the bar and contemplate the tile as you enjoy the chunky salsa and really good chips. Will return!"
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month.
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,side of chips and salsa,Chips and Salsa was acceptable.  Service was good. But I came for the tacos and they sucked. The hunt continues to find badass tacos in Madison

Francisco's Mexican Cantina,enchiladas verdes,"Food is okay . Basic Mexican food not bad Francisco cooks Mexico City type cuisine.

His aunt owns Guadalajara on Park St. That food there has always been delicious.  They cook northern Mexican style cuisine and they use El  Milagro tortillas from Chicago, the best!

People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,Yummy delicious perfect gyros. They're meaty and spiced wonderfully. The sauce is not too tangy and there are veggies in there as well. $4-something each.  Inside of the store smells delicious and owners are sweet and helpful.
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Want donuts in Madison?  This is where you ought to be.  The people's bakery is a small donut shop on Madison's east side and the place represents this town perfectly.  They also serve food like Gyros, which are delicious, but probably not Madison best gyro.  

A husband and wife team run this place and they do an outstanding job.  Super nice too.  If you want an outstanding box of donuts, like top-notch stuff, this place is worth your time.  And if you want to buy local and support an outstanding company than THIS IS IT!"
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Ok, let's just be honest here. The ""decor"" leaves much to be desired. But really, this is not why I stop at People's Bakery. It's those damn doughnuts (the French crullers to be specific). These guys make the most amazing doughnuts, the French cruller as you've now learned are my favorite. I can easily inhale 3 or 4 of these buggers at a time. They are perfectly light and airy, and the glaze hugs the outside so perfectly, they just melt in your mouth. God I love 'em. I've also had the kibbe, which I think is wonderful. My son will accompany me on a trip to People's Bakery if I promise to buy him a couple doughnuts. The two of us sit in the scanty boothed table as he unenthusiastically watches me savor every last tidbit of the kibbe dipped in the yogurt sauce. Mmmmm... considering how labor intensive it is to make kibbe at home, these are a god-send. I'm admittedly no connoisseur when it comes to Lebanese foods, but their kibbe wins my vote for quick and tasty. On a side note: my son who is a teenager, still remembers when he was 2 yrs old, how the owner was so nice to him and greeted him every time we entered the store. It may not be a palace, but the food and pride in ownership makes a mark on one's memory and taste buds."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Delicious donuts, very good falafel. I had a potato dish that seemed a little on the old side. They shouldn't have served it if it was past due. Gyros is good quality. My advice is come here and order high-turnover foods. Very nice people and the food is well-priced, definitely worth supporting over all of the awful chains that line this stretch of East Washington."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"What do you get when you combine Lebanese cuisine, baked goods, gyros, funky interior design and second hand talk of bed bugs?  

The perfect #yelpnewvember storm, that's what.

Over the summer, there was a spirited debate about where to find the best gyros in town after the unfortunate demise of Dmitri's.  After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.

If you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. 

I ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  

On the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:
* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.
* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.
* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.

Now the positives:
* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.
* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.
* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.

So, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"After moving from Chicago to Madison, I thought that I would be safely tucking my Lebanese palate into the furthest recesses of my tongue, saving it only for the occasional trips back to Kedzie Avenue.  That was, until my wife and I discovered People's bakery.  

Upon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful restaurants as Salam and Semiramis...but with Donuts!  We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store.  

We ordered a lunch ""to-go.""  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  

Nonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?  They looked stunningly good, but we both left that for another day.  Lebanese food and donuts....a winning combination, in my book."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  

Start with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.

This was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    

Quick review:
- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint

- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.

- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.

- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  

Sarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful

All in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"OK Mediterranean food.  Not the best, but not the worst.  My falafel sandwich was decent.  The cucumber sauce had a nice, refreshing flavor.  The falafels themselves were very herb-y but didn't have a whole lot of crunch.  Some people don't care, but I like mine crunchy.  My husband wasn't too happy with his gyro--meat a little tough and the flavors were a little bland.

The doughnut we had, though, was very good.  We had a chocolate cake doughnut.  Very good chocolate flavor and delicious cake.  The doughnut and pastry selection is impressive, as is the drink selection (although everything is in bottles and cans--didn't see any fountain drinks, but they do make coffee drinks, too).

Nice, small, family-run restaurant.  The owners were very nice to us, especially my son, who was running around all over the place.  Although there's a lot better Mediterranean in Madison, this might be the best one on the East Side that is open during dinner time.  This might be the best doughnut place on this side of town, though, so if you're on the East Side and are having a doughnut hankering, check out People's Bakery."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"I am a really fussy eater (being from India does not help). Having tasted most Middle-eastern food in town, I would say, this is at par (if not better than) Lulu's, at a fraction of the price. I have absolutely fallen in love with this place. I tried something called the Chicken Tan Tan (sp?) - half a chicken nicely marinated and then baked with a side order of rice. It was out of this world. I also tried a couple of salads - both were outstanding. The vegetarian options are also great. Like I said earlier, no other place in Madison (other than Lulu's) comes close to their quality. If you dont mind their decor (or lack thereof), you have to go there !"
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"This place was very disappointing. I primarily came here because I had a taste for some kibbeh. I've been in some dives that have had amazing food; this place is not one of them. I ordered kibbeh, yanlangi (Sarma/stuffed grape leaves), and baba ganoush. Beginning with the kibbeh; it was on the bland side and the texture was off. It was as though they had fried the earlier that day or week, placed it in the refrigerator for several hours/days, then microwaved them. There was no crispieness to them, in fact they were slightly soggy and lukewarm at best. As for the grape leaves, let me begin by saying that these have only ever been served to me room temperature or just below, they were very cold like there were sitting in the coldest part of the refrigerator. As a result of the low temperature, the flavors of the yanlangi were lost. It wasn't until they warmed up slightly that the grape leaves started to taste normal. Finally, the only complaint I have about the baba ganoush is that they gave me only a half a pita that was very thin (more of a Turkish style).

I don't normally complain about the appearance of a restaurant because the food is usually good, well that's not the case here. The place was cluttered; the layout is not the best thereby furthering the cluttered feeling. The place was also dirty; I don't know what I leaned on or touched but I went in the restaurant with clean short and left with a black soot like substance on the front of my leg. Finally, the customer service was awful; I wasn't greeted by anyone and it felt like my walking in the building was a burden to them. The only words spoken to me was the price of my food. The entire experience was off putting. To their credit, taxes are built into the price which is nice to see. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Kind of tucked away and hard to notice, especially being next to the really glammed out Ella's Deli. But worth a visit if you're looking for a good gyro or kebab. :]

The donuts are alright too. They have a wide variety! Myself, I really rather like their cookies. They also offer homemade baklava.

Really though I can reccomend their sandwiches with a side of the seasoned fries. Quite yummy! Vegetarian options also available such as potato kahbi or falafel sandwiches. And they had a lot of beverages to choose from too.

Although the location is not ideal, it's worth a stop if you're in that part of town. :]"
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Updated review,
I have to give them more stars. For one they have pretty tasty food once I tried more dishes.  The cucumber sauce on the side also really good.  It has also become my stop for mousaka! Mmmm"
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Since moving to the east side I have started to go here almost every Saturday morning to pick up a couple of donuts and a coffee. I had absolutely no idea that it existed until a cabbie friend of mine told me it was one of his favorite places to stop between fares.

(Can I just say that cabbies are amazing? They know where everything is, and they know about all the cool hidden spots that most of us pass up every day. If you know a cabbie, pick their brain sometime. You will probably discover at least one awesome place because of them.)

So, back to People's. The donuts are really top notch. Chewy, moist, iced just enough, and they have a ton of options. I really think that their plain glazed and their boston cream donuts are the best. Their glazed donuts have this bit of crispiness to them that is amazing. The fritters aren't as good as Greenbush, but still tasty. There are also some specialty desserts that I am unsure of, but will have to try some day. 

As far as the food goes - the gyros are among the best I have had in town (right up there with Gyro House) but that is all I have tried there so far.

So, to sum it all up: good gyros, great donuts, fair prices, and great (but sort of slow) service. This place is definitely worth checking out."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Delicious donuts! I thought the vanilla frosted long john was on par with Greenbush's similar donuts. This should be your donut stop on the East Side. They also serve hot middle eastern food, which I plan to come back to try. 

Just make sure you have some time, even if you're just picking up donuts to go. There was just one person working the counter and cooking customers' meals so the whole process took awhile."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"The donuts are amazing and super-fattening of course, but then I guess you shouldn't be eating donuts if you are concerned with your weight.

I agree it is by far the best gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on. Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don't waste your money and calories elsewhere.

Falafel is good, has it's own unique recipe, works for me.

Tan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...

Anyway, People's Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner. And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!

P.S. I also liked a bunch of other stuff there, the hummus, side dishes, veggie mezza, etc. Probably can't go wrong with anything there."
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"We will drive from Dudgeon Monroe to the East side for good falafel and gyros. The quality and service at People's Bakery are a great reminder why the (much closer) Biryani doesn't deserve our business. Skip the babaganoush, but make sure to grab a sweet treat for dessert instead!"
People's Bakery,side of hot sauce,"Went there today with my fiance.  We had the hummus and lamb and the felafel.  The lamb was amazing.  Little pieces cut up and placed on a bed of hummus.  The hummus was very smooth and great texture.  The hummus was good, but Bunky's is still my favorite in town. 

The felafel was good, not too heavy.  Serve in pita bread with a sauce and veggies.  They have a good selection of beverages, they had my favorite Nantucket Nectar and some good bottled lemonade.

After our main course we decided to try some pastries.  The baklava was amazing.  It was light and flavorful.  We also had a french glazed doughnut which was better then Greenbush.  

The lady that works the counter is very friendly.  When we went back to purchase the pastries we only had credit cards, and they have a $5 minimum.  She let us just add it to the tip of our original bill!"
People's Bakery,falafel,"We decided to stop at a local food joint on our road trip back to Minneapolis. It was okay. The place is a bit dirty and falling apart. We ordered two falafel pitas which were just 'okay' as well. The falafel was soft, so don't expect the fried, crispy variety. Everyone raves about the baklava, which we had to try, only to be disappointed. We must've gotten an old batch because is was both dry and soggy. It should have some crisp to it.  Would not stop here again on future road trips."
People's Bakery,falafel,"In addition to sweet treats like donuts and bear claws, they also have lunch and dinner options for cheap. Falafel is not the best in town, but try the gyro, which comes as a sandwich or entree sized plate. They have other standard Mediterranean options such as hummus and kebobs. Seating is limited and would not be good for large groups. Definitely more of a take-out place. I would definitely go back to explore their menu."
People's Bakery,falafel,"Delicious donuts, very good falafel. I had a potato dish that seemed a little on the old side. They shouldn't have served it if it was past due. Gyros is good quality. My advice is come here and order high-turnover foods. Very nice people and the food is well-priced, definitely worth supporting over all of the awful chains that line this stretch of East Washington."
People's Bakery,falafel,"I haven't had any of the falafel or gyros here.........yet.  I have had the opportunity to fatten myself up that much more by eating some of their delicious doughnuts.  They are really cheap AND really good.  

The owners are a friendly, older couple who look like they are workin' hard.  I asked if they would be my new parents, and they just laughed, but I was serious.  Will you be my new mom and dad?  Or how about my new granny and papa?  I won't ask for money..............just doughnuts!

I'm toilet trained........

*knocking on glass window*

Please???"
People's Bakery,falafel,"The doughnuts are good (and pretty cheap!), but I really love this place for a quick, cheap lunch.  They make their falafel and gyros fresh, so be prepared to wait a few minutes for them to put 'em together.  There's a small dining area, or you can take your food to go.  The owners are friendly and efficient.

The only thing I really wish this place would do is make fresh bread and rolls, but it's strictly doughnuts and sweet pastries here."
People's Bakery,falafel,"Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  

Start with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.

This was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    

Quick review:
- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint

- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.

- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.

- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  

Sarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful

All in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj."
People's Bakery,falafel,"Who says donuts and Lebanese food don't go together?!  People's Bakery has made me a believer of this magical combination! This place is great for some affordable, delicious Lebanese food, and some of the best donuts in town. The outside (and inside) is unassuming, but the food is authentic (as far as I know) and yummy. 

Pros
- VERY affordable
- friendly and helpful staff
- Did I mention it is scrumptious?

Cons
- service is a little slow
- inconsistent drink options

I highly recommend trying their falafel with a fritter for dessert."
People's Bakery,falafel,Living 1 block away is dangerous! This is a hidden treasure for sure. The owners are a sweet older couple who knock out some amazing food. Can't speak for the donuts but I promise you will enjoy the food. The falafel with fries is a bargain--5 bucks or so--and it will be made totally fresh for you. My go to I don't feel like cooking spot.
People's Bakery,falafel,"Kind of tucked away and hard to notice, especially being next to the really glammed out Ella's Deli. But worth a visit if you're looking for a good gyro or kebab. :]

People's Bakery,falafel,"Best falafel in the midwest, and I've tried dozens."
People's Bakery,falafel,"You don't want to come here if you are looking for a fantastic dining atmosphere, but you can't beat it for great take-out.  The falafel is amazing!  Their hummus doesn't come close to competing with Banzo, but the prices are quite a bit cheaper.  You can walk out with two falafel pita sandwiches for under ten dollars."
People's Bakery,falafel,"I love this place. 

Excellent donuts, you must try one even if you go in for ""regular"" food. My favorite are the blueberry. 

Super yummy gyros piled high with meat. Kickass falafel. I've also had the steak and rice and thought it was great. 

Nice owners, sometimes the service is a little slow, but they are a small business with usually only the owner and maybe his wife working. Take a book or magazine along, it may take a few minutes to get your order."

People's Bakery,falafel,"Herein lie the finest falafel sandwiches in the area, and that's all that's needed to justify my continuing patronage.

The donuts fill the display cases with colors, and fill the air with intoxicating scents. So many different shapes and sizes, but the freshness and delicacy are consistent throughout. The ""Rapid Dozen"" is a good value, providing a diverse sampling of donut types to take to work, provided they make it that far.

Still, my main inspiration behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel. You will find plenty of tasty dishes, from hummus and babaganoush, to kebabs and gyros, but the incomparable falafel stands above. There aren't, truth be told, more than a few real competitors for Madison's top falafel (Banzo is also great, then it drops off), but those found at People's are really top notch, competitive with any I've had throughout the country.

The prices and the falafels simply cannot be beat, and the owners are incredibly warm and friendly people who have been crafting joy through delicious food for many moons now. There is nothing to keep me from recommending People's Bakery with the full five stars."
People's Bakery,falafel,"Great place to go for gyros, falafel, and lots of other delicious Mediterranean / Lebanese food that's worth trying. Also, the food is really cheap - you can get a whole huge bag of great food for under 20 bucks. An older Lebanese couple run this place - they are very nice and do a good job. As far as the bakery items, go with twisty donut things w/ the red strip down the middle or the baklava."

Please???"
People's Bakery,gyros sandwich,"great donuts. great gyros.
and the most adorable owners ever.
just make sure you aren't in any rush, if you think about ordering food here. still worth visiting."
People's Bakery,gyros sandwich,"What do you get when you combine Lebanese cuisine, baked goods, gyros, funky interior design and second hand talk of bed bugs?  

The perfect #yelpnewvember storm, that's what.

Over the summer, there was a spirited debate about where to find the best gyros in town after the unfortunate demise of Dmitri's.  After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.

If you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. 

I ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  

On the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:
* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.
* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.
* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.

Now the positives:
* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.
* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.
* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.

So, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering."

People's Bakery,gyros sandwich,"I've been lamenting the lack of Mediterranean establishments on the Eastside for a while. We have arguably the best Thai, Indian, Nepali, Jamaican, Japanese, Chinese and American restaurants in town. But Downtown and the Westside both hold the Mediterranean trump card.

Then I discovered People's Bakery. How can you go wrong? Fresh pastry AND gyros? Wait. Did I say gyros? Yes, I did. No longer do you have to venture downtown to get said sandwich. And the one I had wasn't a ticking grease bomb!

Do yourself a favor when you go and try the red lentil soup. The flavor is excellent and there's plenty of cumin to spare. Delicious! My gyro and bowl of soup plus coffee was under $10, so it's a great choice when you're low on cash and need a filling lunch.

(Oh, and it's right next to El Pescador, across from the Madison East Shopping Center. Pretty easy to miss when driving.)"
People's Bakery,gyros sandwich,"Excelent food.  Many times I've ordered something on the menu that was described in a way that painted a more plain, bland and uneventful picture, and have always been plesantly surprised !  After this happened once, I dont assume that shicken pita sandwich means only that !   Delicious fresh food.  Great prices, homemade.
Like many non upscale, true small ethnic restaurants, it is sparcely decorated.   In a world where restaurants hire interior designers, it can take some getting used to eating in a restaurant where the focus really is on the food.  Oh, yea fortions are really good too !
and the only focus is really on the food."

People's Bakery,gyros sandwich,"I've been here a couple times for the donuts, which are awesome. But I didn't feel compelled to write a review until coming here for dinner a few days ago - the food is absolutely delicious! It's a shame it's not more obvious from the outside, but the lunch/dinner menu is extensive, the prices are excellent, the people are friendly, and the food is phenomenal. I got a gyro sandwich and it was enormous, delicious, and only $4.50. 

I love Banzo, which is the obvious point of comparison for People's Bakery, but I'd probably choose PB given that the food is just as good an a whole lot cheaper. I'll definitely be coming back!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Yaba Dahba Dooooo! Wow! I had the vegetarian special on Sunday which gives you three vegetarian curries, rice, an order of naan, yogurt sauce, rice pudding, and soup/salad to start for $8.95!!! In Madison, that's a bargain; at any price with food this good, it's awesome. The staff was great and it was nice and cool; clean space."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"My favorite Indian food in Madison. I've tried many dishes here, chicken and vegetarian, as well as many of the appetizers, breads, and chutneys. Everything is excellent. Some favorites include the chicken shahi korma, muttar paneer, vegetable samosa, and garlic naan. I enjoy the professionalism of staff and owners. A really nice dining experience whether at lunch or dinner."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I have had nothing but amazing food and fabulous service here. My favorites include the Tandori Mixed Grill, Chicken Madras, and Chicken Tika Masala. Be sure to try the peshwari naan-a sweet kick to the traditional naan. You will quickly become a regular. :)"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Honestly, not very experienced when it comes to Indian food, but this was really good in taste and serving size. More of a 3.5 star experience, but no option for that, so no wrong in showing a little extra love. 
We had the lamb curry, goat curry, two types of naan bread, along with a chutney and a yogurt sauce. All were perfectly spiced for the level we ordered (mild & medium), and the bread was excellent. 
Ordered online through a delivery service, so I imagine it's even better going straight from kitchen to table. Definitely will be eating here again."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I think I could eat here every day and not get bored.
The staff is informative and helpful. The samosas are brought with a sampler of sauces, each one is fantastic. It is mouth watering good! The garlic naan is very tasty.
My husband's co-worker ate here everyday for 3 months while she was here for business. I can see why, the items on the menu are delicious. 
This place is a MUST for anyone wanting to experience the best Indian food in town!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Ordered delivery, and it took an hour and a half on a Tuesday night.  Delivery driver blamed it on having to wait on the restaurant - but I'm not completely certain where the disconnect was since my hotel is within walking distance.  Chicken Korma was the blandest I have ever eaten - but the Chicken Tikki Masala was very redeeming.  I ordered both at medium heat, so it was really surprising to have one be so flavorful and the other so bland.  Naan was very cold by the time my order arrived.  May try dining in next time - difficult to discern quality when I'm not sure how long the food sat prior to delivery.  I would NOT recommend ordering delivery to anyone else."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I really like this place because the food is really that good and it's very close to my house. The restaurant seems very clean, the decor and music are pleasant. They use white linen on the tables which I think gives a good touch. I always get the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. My mom gets the lamb curry with soup. Super delicious!  I like it better than swagat in middleton. The employees are very nice. One time I had to wait extra long for take out and they gave me complimentary glass of wine."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Get ready for some real good Indian food. It would be unrealistic of me to expect 100% authentic Indian taste that you can only find in India, but this place is pretty close to being authentic, which is great because even this level of similarity is hard to find.
What stood out, was their keema naan, malai kofta and butter chicken. Best thing about Indian restaurants are that they have excellent variety of vegetarian dishes. Paneer makhni here was out of the box. Naan/breads were very very fresh, seemed like straight outa oven. We ordered keema naan, garlic naan, spinach naan, butter naan and regular naan and all were good.
Good service too, we ordered their veggie vindaloo and found it to be very tangy letting them know about it, their manager replaced it with another dish. 
Good ambience, great food, good service, clean bathroom, Overall a great experience."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Tried dinner here after an Epic XGM day and was extremely blown away with the great flavors of all the food, low key ambience, and amiable service.  I opted for level 3 heat for my Chicken Shahi Korma based upon another Yelp review.  If I have the pleasure of being back in the area, I will return to Dhaba and go with a level 4 (or 5!) heat next time!  We ordered 3 different kinds of naan--- garlic, cheese and peshawari naan--- and they were all so tasty that I had no room for the basmati rice that came with the korma.  The peshawari was a slightly sweeter naan with hints of cashews, raisins and coconut--- nom nom nom! We closed the food flavor experience with gulab jamun for dessert--- 3 tiny fried balls soaked in a sweet sugar syrup with a subtle hint of rose!  I only regret not taking pictures of it all to post with this review."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"The quality of the service here deserves 5 stars, especially considering the price of the meals.  The linen tablecloths and napkins are almost absurd considering the prices, too.  Really nice plates and utensils.  The decor...well, this is more in line with what you pay.  Think Chipotle: concrete floor, exposed ducts under corrugated roof...industrial casual.  Kind of weird.

The food: samosas were good.  Meal comes with a little cup of soup, which was tasty.  Garlic naan is fine, nothing special.  Curry was not apparently traditionally made; the sauce was mediocre, tasting only of tomato and (too much) chili pepper, with no simmered meat richness.  Rice smelled distinctly of used ashtray (seriously).

Great service, good prices, kind of jarring atmosphere, and just OK food."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"This Place is so close to my office that it was inevitable to try. so glad i did, the best, most flavorful dishes are served here. the cheese naan, although not too traditional-Indian, is the best I've ever had. their chicken Masala is also incredible. The price is right for on the go lunches with generous portions. a bit overpriced for dinner with same menu/portions as lunch, and that's why they get 4 stars!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"This was our first time visiting and it definitely won't be our last. Very nice dining area, modern and clean. Our waiter was very attentive and took good care of us. We appreciate the hospitality. 

Great selection of drinks and the food menu was extensive. Everything looked good, so it was hard to decide. We started with the lamb samosas. Really delicious. I think next time we'll get the traditional and lamb together. Ordered some cheese naan, which came along with our meals. The shrimp curry and lamb masala were absolutely amazing. The flavor of all the sauces were so complex and tasty. We decided on a ""3"" level for heat. The basmati rice was so light and perfect. 

Everything was perfect. I have no complaints what so ever. Thank you."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,We ordered from here this past Wednesday and the Chicken Tiki Masala was tender and juicy. The naan was still warm and soft. The rice topped off our meal. I eat Indian in several cities I travel too and this was one of the better places. A nice surprise!
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Excellent food, attentive staff. I really enjoyed all the vegetarian options, the vegetables masala was flavorful without being too greasy. The vegetarian appetizer platter was perfect for 2 people, lots of food and variety and everything was super tasty. I felt very lucky to eat on the patio there, today as well. The garlic naan was great. I didn't feel like we overpaid."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Another delicious meal, this time with Tariq by my side. He really enjoyed his food but will never stop measuring the food against the incredible delights at Anmol in Milwaukee. That said, Dhaba did just fine. 
We were both over-hungry after spending a couple hours at Shoe Box. We had the Allo Tikki Chat to start. Chana Masala and a yummy potato mash together with some sauce. For entrees we had Lamb Bhartha and Paneer Masala. There was loads of tender lamb in a wonderful sauce. The paneer are squares of homemade cheese in a creamy masala sauce. Both were perfectly seasoned to the medium spicy we requested. We also had the naan that was soft and tasty.
Tariq had chai which was excellent, not too sweet and I had a Mud Puppy, dark beer. The beer was a good compliment to the spicy food. 
The service was excellent. I would have liked a little time to finish my appetizer before the entree arrived. Final bill $47 with a full meal of leftovers to go. 10% discount for cash.
We shall return. Get the to the Dhaba. No excuse not to."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"We visited here on Friday November 4 on a trip to Middleton. We were staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, which is so super close to this restaurant. Mistakenly, we drove to the restaurant when it would have been very easy and pleasant to walk. There is plenty of parking for the restaurant which is also really convenient for people who drive.

The restaurant was really busy when we got there around seven but we were seated immediately. The menu is really expansive and wonderful for vegetarians. We ordered garlic naan, gobi manchurian, vegetable vindaloo, and had a salad and lentil vegetable soup. The soup was delicious- a creamy lentil broth with a delicate flavor. The garlic naan was very delicious and had lots of fresh garlic and cilantro on top. We asked for both entrees to be prepared mild but we found them to be more medium spicy. That made it hard to finish my dish. The gobi Manchurian was really delicious and was freshly prepared. The vindaloo had a lovely vinegar flavor which we loved, but it was a bit too spicy. 

Once we were finished, we waited 30 minutes before going up to get someone to bring our check. That was ok since we weren't in a hurry. It was such a treat to have great Indian food on our trip to Middleton and I would definitely recommend visiting!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Dhaba Indian Bistro is so good. I've only ordered take-out so far, but the dining room looks nice.  I love all their choices of naan, the Samosas and their many vegetarian choices.  I'm able to spend about $13 and stretch it to two or three meals!  They let you choose how spicy you want curry dishes, which is nice.  Flavors are vibrant and so good... I might have to order from them for supper tonight just thinking about it!  Definitely worth a try."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Went here for the first time an was overwhelmed by the food and great service! 

Got the Vegetarian Dinner for Two! Was about $40 so was concerned about the price/quality/quantity of the food but was quite happy with what came. Huge generous portions of 3 entrees(which we didn't even finish 1/4 of-took it to go!), soup or salad(healthy lentil soup! Wasn't the best lentil I've had but not bad! Will probably try the salad next time), great naan and rice and a top notch dessert to cap it all off.

Service was great. They had 2-3 helping us throughout the entire meal. No waiting around for a check or a change to your order or, well, ordering your food to begin with. This is very important to me - even more so than the food in many cases so I'm quite happy! 

Will return! I can say this is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison now. I'm tempted to try the buffet sometime also"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"This was my first time I've had Indian food, so I was skeptical... But this place was so good, I took my boyfriend. He also loved it!  My favorite items on the menu are the garlic naan and chicken Curry #5"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Gave Dhaba a try when we were in Middleton and so glad we did. My wife and I shared a veggie pakora appetizer that was very refreshing and tasty. My wife ordered the tikka masala with soup. And I ordered the veggie vindaloo. The vindaloo was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. My wife absolutely loved her masala. We shared some garlic naan that was brought out freshly made. The soup was also very flavorful and enjoyable. Washed it all down with a mango lasi. They also give you a discount if you pay in cash. The lunch prices are a pretty good value, considering you are getting everything made to order. We prefer going here for lunch than many of the other buffet style restaurants that are scattered throughout Madison. The staff are also very attentive and helpful in explaining anything on the menu. There spicy scale is pretty spot on as well."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"All you need to know about this place is that it's wonderful. The tikka masala is the best I've ever had and their garlic naan is second to naan (haha...get it? I had to) Anyway, dinner is a tiny bit pricey, but if you just order an extra rice and 2 orders of naan with one entree, it's PLENTY of food and a great price!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"We came here on a Friday night with a craving for some Indian deliciousness and were not disappointed. The lentil soup that comes with the meal was delicious, and both of our meals were awesome. I had the chicken Tika masala and my husband had the butter chicken. We both had spice level 3 which was perfect for him but a little too hot for me. I had garlic naan (yum!) and my husband had a wheat version which was probably healthier but also tasted kinda like cardboard. Both of our dishes reheated well the next day, and the price was great! Very reasonable for the amount of food provided.

Interior was clean and classy, very nice feel for a dinner date. Only complaint was service was pretty slow. Not a deal breaker, but not as fast as other locations in Middleton."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"This was the first place I ever had Indian food. I GREATLY enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala. I went back quite a few times because I worked across the street. I've since had other Indian places and I can say this is the best I've had yet. The cheese naan was on point. The service was superb. Very friendly always. They even let us know that they have ""off the charts"" spicy. The hottest they have would rate maybe a 2 on the Thai spice level. So if you request off the charts they give you some extra spice to add on your own."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Came for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty busy, but the service was still quite good. The  menu is quite large, with lots of great curry options. Chicken Madras was excellent, but the cheese naan wasn't great."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"A great delicious Indian place in town! I was surprised when I arrived on a Sunday, there was no characteristic aroma nor the classic lunch buffet! Very excited I wouldn't bring the aroma around me after food and sadly feel hungry all the time.... 

We were the first customers at around 11am, the space was wide and you could easily fit large parties of 10 or more. As we went through our lunch, several other tables arrived. We noticed that a couple with a young baby was seated right by the bathroom, placing them further away from other tables; my friends and I thought that was extremely thoughtful of them!

I really enjoyed the food selection, some things are completely new and I have not seen them at other indian restaurants.

Good dishes to try:
Mango lassi - much more yoghurty than other places, actually really refreshing with food!
Meat platter - nice chicken tender-like things, fried fish was nice and flaky. And i love the cracker and sauces to dip on the side
Aloo naan - potato naan sounds weird, but seriously, you'd not go back to regular naan!!
Beef briyani - great flavor, and surprisingly spicy. beef was tender and tasty!
Chicken Makhani - loved the thick tikka masala sauce. very well cooked chicken! love it!

We shared the dishes among 3, and had at least a third of the dishes to bring home as leftovers. Just a note, the dishes were still wonderful after microwaving ;) Finally, be aware of the spiciness level, for Asian tastebuds that eat moderate spicy level, 2 stars is more than enough!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I really enjoyed the lunch special (meat platter), and I'll definitely come back for it again. For the price ($9.95) it is great value - three meats, four slices of naan, awesome yogurt sauce and dessert. After all that food it is pretty much impossible to still be hungry.

My friend ordered the chicken biryani ($8.95) which we both agreed was quite good.

The only thing that was average was the mango lassi - nothing to write home about.

Very friendly staff. Clean and spacious. Ample parking. Right next to Greenway Station to walk off the calories. What's not to like?"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I stopped at Dhaba for the first time this week.  On the good side, the restaurant looks very good and the staff is courteous and efficient.  Also, our naan bread was delicious.  On the bad side, the very bad side, the lamb vindaloo was inedible.  It appeared to be canned tomato soup, slightly spiced and heated with some lamb dropped in.  Terrible!  The chicken tikka masala was barely passable.  I think the sauce also came from a jar, at least it tasted like it.  

I cannot recommend this restaurant for anything other than naan.  If you want Indian, any other Indian restaurant in town would be better."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Perhaps I am being overly critical of Dhaba or perhaps their quality has slipped. My mother and I were craving Indian but didn't want to do the Swagat buffet so we decided to check out Dhaba. Of course every Indian restaurant has their 5 star dishes but I can sadly say that what we ordered wasn't 5 star quality. Was it edible for me yes, however, my mother stated multiple times that her beef masala was inedible. In fact, she stated that she had never tasted meat like that which was in the masala and even compared it to organ meat. After being extremely turned off by this I was reluctant to try it. However, I can tell you that my paneer masala was a solid 3 stars. The panner cubes were exactly as one might expect but the sauce to paneer ratio left much to be desired. That being said, the rice was perfect and the sauce was tasty. Was it the best masala that I have ever had? No, but it was far from the worst either.

In addition to having the entrees, the lunches were also served with a small soup or salad. We both opted for the lentil soup and a side order of cheese naan. Both were solid but nothing special. The lentil soup was bland but edible and the naan was a solid waste of calories.

For the $9 or $10 price tag per entree, Dhaba is definitely at the top of the Madison Indian food spectrum for lunch especially since even plain naan is extra. I happen to love Indian food quite a bit and often have to resist licking the bowl clean. However, Dhaba left much to be desired and I can say that I won't be going back with the better options around the Madison area."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,So glad we found a good Indian restaurant in our area! Woo hoo! We order the fish masala (medium spicy) and the chole with garlic naan and it is soooo delicious. The prices are reasonable and the food is so flavorful! Also they are very quick when we call to order takeout so we have been very pleased.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"The best indian food I have ever had!
Vegetarian appetizer platter- all items had their true uniqueness. All retained crispness after being in a takeout container.
Lamb and spinach was flavorful and tender. Nice dpice balance.
Garlic naan was crisp and chewey even after bring in takeout foil!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"The food was fabulous.  Waiters were very nice and attentive.  The garlic Naan was very tasty as were the two other curries we ordered.  They will serve your food spiced to order.   I'm not fond of super hot food, but we ordered ours at a ""three"" and that was perfect."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I found this place due to it's great Yelp reviews. I had fantastic lamb Tandoori and Naan to go. The Yogurt sauce with carrots and herbs was a great way to cool off the spicy Lamb and rice. The staff was quick, polite and packaged up my meal quickly.

Want to save some money? They offer discounts for paying with cash instead of credit card."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Indian food is one of my absolute favorite cuisines for its flavor, spice, and creativitiy, but the price of it versus my grad student budget makes it a special treat only. After seeing Dhaba's affordable lunch menu online, I had to try this place out. I'm incredibly happy I did.

Surprisingly quiet for noon on a Saturday, but it just meant that my food came to me faster. The $6.95 lamb curry with basmati rice was savory and delicious. Medium spicy was definitely medium, so as a spice enthusiast, I'm getting hot next time. For the price, I certainly didn't expect a choice of soup or salad with my entree, but ta-da! I chose the lentil soup. While it was a very small portion, it was really good, with carrots, vegetables, and lentils in a light broth. 

The strawberry lassi arrived with whipped cream and a cherry on top, like a strawberry shake, but one sip revealed a great blend of strawberry with a yogurt tang. It went really well with my meal.

Last but not least, the naan. Garlic naan. It's my weakness, and this is some of the best I've had. $2.95 got me a basket full of hot naan crammed full of chopped garlic, cilantro, and ghee, and it was wonderful.

So for $13, I got a meat curry, soup, lassi, and naan. There are Indian restaurants that would charge me that for the entree alone, and the quality of the food was the same, if not better. Dhaba is definitely worth a visit."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I didn't think I'd be eating Indian food when I went to Wisconsin for business, let alone quite good Indian food. They make things spicy if you ask for them, and everything was very flavorful. The naan was also very fluffy and great. Recommended if you are staying at one of the hotels in the area and want a good meal, especially compared to all the other places in the area"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Great Indian?  My favorite part of this restaurant is their lunch menu (they don't do buffets) it is so affordable, so you can take multiple items home to try!  For under $30, my hubby and I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Shrimp Vindaloo, Lamb Biryani (rice dish), garlic naan, plan naan, and extra raita.  All meals come with their cumin toasted basmati rice!  We have enough for at least another meal and half!  I am so excited they opened.  Haven't ate in yet, dinning room looks nice and staff is always wonderful during counter service."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"We tried this for lunch on a Saturday. We were the first people to arrive for lunch a little after 11 AM. The server didn't mention the specials...we saw them on the way out. We ordered appetizers that appeared to be reheated a bit, they were not hot or very warm at all. The soup was brought out while we were eating our appetizers, shortly afterward the entrees were brought out while we were still eating our appetizers. The lamb masala had good flavor for left overs. The same for my wife's vegetable vindaloo. Naan is an extra charge, soup  is included. All in all, clueless service as far as normal meal service goes (but polite). Reheated food passed off as made to order. For  a $31 lunch I would rather check out a buffet for $10 less for two people."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Tasty food and courteous helpful staff. 

I had malai Kofta, chicken malai, punjabi Kabab, sweet lassi and naan. My favorite was chicken items. 

Price is slightly higher side. Sunday lunch only there is concessions and you get thali for 10 bucks. If I live in Madison I would go for Sunday lunch."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Let me start by saying I'm Indian and a bratty SNOB when it comes to Indian food. My family is Punjabi like the family that owns the restaurant, so I very much appreciated the mostly North Indian menu. 

Food: YUM! We have the Non-Veg appetizer platter (SO GOOD! Keema Samosa was one of the best I've had). We ordered malai kofta, chicken tikka masala with garlic and chicken naan. We later got some Saag (spinach dish) and kheer. 

Naan - We ended up trying garlic, chicken and plain naan. All kind were great! 

Malai Kofta - Best I've had in Madison. I've tried a few other places and they just don't hit the spot the way this one did. 

Chicken Tikka Masala - It's the only chicken dish I think is ever worth ordering at an Indian restaurant. This dish was literally designed for Indian restaurants, it's not authentic to India rather Great Britain.  So I don't bother with anything else. Dhaba's was reallllllly good!

Saag - My mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it. 

Kheer -  I'm not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and I stole my mom's because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. 

We ordered at a spice level 3 and found it perfect. I'm not someone that loves spicy food (ie. Hyderabi, Goan, Pakistani food.. I can't handle you) However, I do like some heat, so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom, sister and myself. My mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that, but she's been cooking without much spice for the past year. 

Restaurant Decor: I really like how they've decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music playing in the background. Totally like a real 'Dhaba' (dhaba's are the Indian version of fast food joints... you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered/tented area.. at least in Punjab & enjoy the whatever deep friend/sloppy delicacy you are offered... usually some sort of comfort food. Back to the review).

Overall this place is awesome! I'm totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them! 

P.S. If you like Taste of India on Monroe street or Brookfield/Fox Valley, the owners family runs those locations as well. 

TWO THUMBS UP!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"The stellar reviews for this place have to be fake. DO NOT go to this place! Mediocre food, and worst of all, mean/petty owner.

I treated my in laws here to their first Indian food (I am Indian), and to their last dinner in Madison. We ordered a lot of food and were supposed to get 5 salads, but only got 4. Then we were just $5 short of the cash discount and the front girl was so mean/unhelpful; she sent us to walk to an atm so far away that we paid in cash after a failed 10 minute walk/run. We were embarrassed in front of my in laws and I was sad that the service was so bad for a place I've been to many times. No special treatment for a regular here!

Dining out at the end of the day is about people, and these folks don't make you feel welcome. It's all about the last penny, and worst of all, by mean/uncaring staff. I wouldn't have been upset if I had to pay the same amount but to a nice and apologetic staff member.

Also: Food is not good. Lots of creamy curry and very, very little meat.  Could not even order a plain lassi, suggesting everything is premade. Naan was okay but too oily. Soup was way too salty and lukewarm. And place is always almost empty (tonight was Saturday at 7-9pm, only one other family) with no music etc.

I was a regular and even considered making them my businesses' regular caterer but won't be back."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"I was on this side of town for work, heard good things about Dhaba Bistro and thought I should check it out.  I decided to get take out for lunch. The staff there were very friendly. I went with the Vegetarian Masala. It was very tasty. It had peas, potato, sweet potato, carrots, and onions.  The sauce was a creamy tomato based sauce.  I really enjoyed the flavor.  I would say the 2nd best Masala that I've had in the Madison area.  I also got an order of their Naan.  I found it to be overly greasy. Their prices are comparable to other Indian restaurants in the area.
Will get food again here when I'm in the area!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"After several years of ordering takeout, I had the pleasure of dining in at Dhaba on an early Saturday afternoon. The space is beautiful; tons of natural light, warm colors, festively folded napkins, and an ambience that is a step closer to fine dining than casual. 

Service: top notch. Truly. Every need we had (which were few due to their anticipatory and attentive service) were attended to, the staff was so warm and welcoming, and they had touches that I'm not used to like waiting politely to set the menus down until I had removed my coat and taken a seat. 

Food: double top notch. I think it's the best Indian food I've had to date. Now, I have to admit that I order chicken tikka masala every time, but that's what I order from every restaurant. I was only half joking when I told my boyfriend I would probably drink the sauce as a straight shot. The chicken is incidental (white meat, tender, good quality); I honestly would be more than happy just dumping the sauce on rice and on naan and calling it a day. Speaking of the naan, it's warm and so soft and, as it turns out, even more delicious when served in house instead of as takeout. 

Dining in we were also offered soup or salad, and we both went with the soup. I believe it was a vegetable lentil; it reminded me of dal. The soup was served at just the right temperature. My boyfriend tried the chicken makhani; rich and chicken-y and a good kick of spice at medium. 

Each of our meals was $8.95, a steal for how much food you get and the wonderful service. I think I'll skip takeout from now on and treat myself to dining in."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"We have a voting system at our workplace that lets people vote on what they want for lunch that day. We try to keep it fair by not allowing a restaurant to win twice in one week. However, if we forget to start a vote, often times we're forced to ""Default Dhaba."" I'm pretty sure those moments of forgetfulness are freudian slips, because we friggin love this place.

Personally, I've found my vice: chicken tikka masala with cheese naan. This amazing combination of bread, cheese, and curry has everything I've ever wanted in a good meal, and then some. I've found some other indian places that have similarly good masala, but the naan stands apart. No other Indian restaurant I've visited has come close to the wonderous naan found at Dhaba."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Dhaba Indian Bistro is a great choice for an Indian meal, and the quality is consistent whether you are eating in or taking out. The staff is always friendly and happy to make recommendations. The interior is clean and inviting, although there is a strange round table to the right of the welcome desk, and I would avoid that on a windy or rainy day. The portions are ample and delicious. Having tried many of their curries, I'm confident in recommending almost anything here.

Let me recommend the Chicken Makhani. It's naturally quite spicy, and as someone who normally likes spice at a 4 on a 5 star level, I always have the makhani at a 2 Dhaba. The garlic naan are always a hit too.

The only dish I have tried that I didn't care for was a lamb curry. I found the lamb to be fatty and I really didn't enjoy it. I haven't tried it since, so I couldn't tell you if it was a one off. I can confidently say that the chicken is consistently high quality.

Top tip?! 10% discount from the price of your dinner either eat-in or take-out when you pay cash!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"The food is really high quality and tastes great. On the weekend, you can get a vegetarian thali for $7.95. That gets you.soup, three different vegetable dishes, several pieces of naan, delicious rice, desert.
Now, this is not your buffet variety food, the thali is freshly cooked, and you can tell. The spices and flavors are sublime. You are offered mild, medium or hot, as desired.
So, instead of feeling like you have to get your money's worth at a $11.95 buffet, try this place out.
If you pay cash, they give you a 5% discount."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,I have a religious devotion to their lamb masala and cheese naan...has overtaken Swagat as my go-to Indian Food on the west side. The owners are also nice as hell.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"An absolute gem with some of the best Indian food that I've had outside of south-central Asia. Definitely try the lamb naan and the paneer, and the curries are phenomenal. Very friendly waitstaff and a really nice vibe as well - one of my favorite spots!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"For all the people stating that this is the best Indian food in Madison, I can only assume that they have not ever been to Maharaja. Or Swagat. Maharaja is the best Indian restaurant in Madison, and we have been going there for years. But to keep an open mind, we have tried Dhaba twice in the past month. 

First of all, the place itself is nicely decorated, and the service is excellent. The waitstaff are polite and attentive, and there are plenty of them. But the food is just not that good (other than the Naan). 

Every entree comes with either soup or salad. We have gotten their lentil soup both times, which is buttery, thin, and tastes very little like lentils. However, it's not bad, just not very interesting or lentil-y.

For main courses, we have had the Chicken Shahikorma and the Chicken Tikka Masala, as well as the Spinach (ie Palak) Paneer (a combo of spinach and farmer's cheese-like cubes) and Spinach Aloo (spinach with potatoes). 

The first time we tried the Chicken Shahikorma, I was suspicious that the base of it was actually canned tomato soup with a few spices added. Seriously. It was a very thin sauce, with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken breast in it. But the sauce was not like any shahikorma I've ever had, and it was not interesting. The second time we came we had the Chicken Tikka Masala, and strangely enough, it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma. The two dishes should not, repeat not, have the same sauce. And the Chicken Tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the Tandoor oven, but there was no evidence that it had been. We felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce. They should not. 

The spinach dishes were ok, except the potatoes in the Spinach Aloo were undercooked - as in crunchy. I didn't eat them. 

The Naan is great, I admit. But the rest just is not that good. Seriously, if folks want really good Indian, go to Maharaja and get the Chicken Shahikorma or Tikka there."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"We've been coming here for about 2 years, sometimes we drive to Madison just to come here for lunch! We have been known to come 2 times in one week because the food has always been great! I myself always get their beef masala! The beef is always so tender that you can shred it with a fork. The masala sauce it's self has just the right amount of spice and the color is a creamy red. My husband always gets their chicken byriyani and loves it! He said that the chicken is always so tender and you get big chuncks. The sizes of both meals are great for what you pay for. We also get the garlic naan, and it has so much garlic flavor. 

The staff are always friendly and helpful. The owner has talked to us about recipes and just about anything else! They have a running special that if you pay cash for your meal you get 10% off for lunch and 20.% off for dinner."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"What a great little find!! I was pleased to stumble upon this place!!  When I walked in I was greeted immediately.  Service was outstanding... the little things they did that may go unnoticed was amazing for me.  Simply saying please and thank you... excuse me when they came to a table to serve food or ask questions... I was in absolute awe.  The food was outstanding!! I got the extra spicy Tandoori Chicken Spinach and yes... I was sweating!! The garlic naan bread went extremely well with it. I would love to bring my wife here if we are in the area.  And on a nice day, I bet the outdoor seating is amazing."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"On a recent search for a great local indian restaurant we discovered two within a mile of our house...both are great but this one is our new favorite!  Easy to miss from the street, it's worth the search to find.  We have been back twice and service has always been prompt and personable.  The food is equally fantastic!  My husband is a huge fan of their tandori chicken and myself love their mango chicken and chicken tikka masala.  The ""dinner for two"" is a great deal and a fun way to try a few entrees too.  The naan was also great as well as their lentil soup.  We are looking forward to going back!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,"Dhaba is my second favorite Indian restaurant around Madison. The first being Swad and the third being Maharani. They have some really good food. The Dal Makhni (Literally lentils and butter) is a must try. It consists of lentils that have been soaked overnight and cooked with butter and spices. They will adjust the spice level depending on your order.

Garlic naan is my best bread. Their garlic is generous and really comes out. It will definitely ward off any vampires that might have strayed too close :) 

On weekends, for lunch, they do a veg and non veg thali. The thali is an Indian version of a sampler. You get small amounts of different items. These guys offer 3 items along with rice and a bread (Roti / naan). For less than $10 it is a steal. When I first saw the thali I felt that the quantity wouldn't be enough to sate me, but I was so wrong. I had to have the additional item I ordered sent back and packed in a to-go box. 

Take cash! They give a 5% discount on lunch prices and a 10% discount on dinner prices if you pay in cash."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,naan,Great food for a very good price. Went for lunch and got the tikka masala but wasn't super impressed by it. The food was very fresh however and the naan was great. Lunch came with a salad. Near the heart of Middleton and plenty of parking.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"My favorite Indian food in Madison. I've tried many dishes here, chicken and vegetarian, as well as many of the appetizers, breads, and chutneys. Everything is excellent. Some favorites include the chicken shahi korma, muttar paneer, vegetable samosa, and garlic naan. I enjoy the professionalism of staff and owners. A really nice dining experience whether at lunch or dinner."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"We went to Dhaba on a whim and we were blown away by the Malai Kofta! It's a vegetable and paneer dumpling curry with creamy tomato sauce and topped with nuts. The lunch special was only $8.50 and included rice and a side soup/salad. The ambiance was authentic and refreshing, with bright tall windows and plenty of spacing between tables. We also ordered the potato samosas as an app and both thought they were a little dry. The trio of sauces complemented the samosas well. 

All in all, I highly recommend this west side bistro! The staff are responsive and friendly."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"All potential for disappointment gets checked at the door and never makes it inside. The friendly owners, portion-to-price ratio and succulent entrees make this place 5-star awesome, a must for anyone who enjoys Indian food. This time while I waited, the owner told me all about Uttarayan, one of India's many major festivals. 

I brought home the chicken tikka masala (wife's favorite) and the chicken vindaloo, along with the veggie appetizer sampler. The samosas are a personal fav and I get those every time, if for no other reason than the sampler of sauces they serve with them. Nirvana for me would mean being dipped in those sauces. Please don't eat me though. The pakoras (fried veggies in a hummus batter) are also perfectly dippable and probably taste slightly better than I do.  

For entrees, I ordered the masala mild, but would step that up a notch next time. The vindaloo was medium-plus spicy and perfect -- just spicy enough to make my forehead sweat but not so spicy as to dominate the flavor. The chicken in both entrees was tender white meat, expertly cooked. 

Eat here. You won't regret it."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"My boyfriend introduced me to Dhaba Indian Bistro a few months back and I have been a fan ever since. I have yet to have a bad experience with either the food or service. The staff is very friendly and definitely remember regular customers 

I really enjoy the basmati rice. One thing that I do like about Dhaba over my favorite lunch spot Curry in the Box is that they do not use jasmine rice. While I do like jasmine rice, the basmati rice is a better fit for the curry. Long grain rice blends very well with the thickness of the curry. 

They offer a large variety of curries ranges from types of curry's and spice levels. The work on a 1-5 scale of spiciness, with 5 being the hottest. Let me just say that I have gotten a yellow shrimp curry dish on a 2 scale and it was spicy so be warned. A scale of 1 is your safest bet. My boyfriend who loves spicy food can barely withstand a 3.

They offer quite a bit of curries, shrimp, chicken, beef, lamb, goat, etc. I must admit that I am not the biggest fan of their cheese roti bread. I definitely prefer Curry in the Box roti bread over Dhaba, however, Dhaba's bread is more thicker making it easy to dip the bread into the curry and eat. 


Their prices do go up during dinner. Even though I've only gone during their lunch hours, I was told by a regular that their serving sizes aren't any different from lunch to dinner so keep that in mind. 

It's a nice outing for people who really enjoy Indian food and/or curry. I know for some people, the smell of curry really turns them away from eating at places like such but the restaurant does a great job with ""hiding"" the smells. Curry can be very overwhelming but the aroma when you dine ad Dhaba is very inviting."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,Great northern Indian food. Outstanding take out and dine in many options. Authentic and homestyle Indian food like mom would make! Highly recommend the chicken tikka and paneer tikka as well as any of their tandoori dishes and appetizers are good also. Wide variety of meat chicken vegetarian options for all courses.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Get ready for some real good Indian food. It would be unrealistic of me to expect 100% authentic Indian taste that you can only find in India, but this place is pretty close to being authentic, which is great because even this level of similarity is hard to find.
What stood out, was their keema naan, malai kofta and butter chicken. Best thing about Indian restaurants are that they have excellent variety of vegetarian dishes. Paneer makhni here was out of the box. Naan/breads were very very fresh, seemed like straight outa oven. We ordered keema naan, garlic naan, spinach naan, butter naan and regular naan and all were good.
Good service too, we ordered their veggie vindaloo and found it to be very tangy letting them know about it, their manager replaced it with another dish. 
Good ambience, great food, good service, clean bathroom, Overall a great experience."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"This Indian food is great, consistent, and delicious. Jump in and start eating!

When Dhaba opened in Middleton, it became our weekly take-out option. I've never actually been to the restaurant as my co-worker always makes the pickup. 

Over the last six months we have rated each dish to our preferences. Here is our list of the best tasting meals that we've had. Sadly, we have not yet eaten our way through the whole menu. As long as Dhaba makes food, we'll continue eating our way through the menu. We've gone heavy on the lamb and vegetarian dishes and skipped most of the chicken and beef. That said, here is our list of favorite dishes. All dishes with an asterisk are my personal favs*.

Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"The quality of the service here deserves 5 stars, especially considering the price of the meals.  The linen tablecloths and napkins are almost absurd considering the prices, too.  Really nice plates and utensils.  The decor...well, this is more in line with what you pay.  Think Chipotle: concrete floor, exposed ducts under corrugated roof...industrial casual.  Kind of weird.

The food: samosas were good.  Meal comes with a little cup of soup, which was tasty.  Garlic naan is fine, nothing special.  Curry was not apparently traditionally made; the sauce was mediocre, tasting only of tomato and (too much) chili pepper, with no simmered meat richness.  Rice smelled distinctly of used ashtray (seriously).

Great service, good prices, kind of jarring atmosphere, and just OK food."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"First, great atmosphere and service. A great place for a business lunch or date night.  Samosas were large and well executed with potato and peas in the filling and three sauces. The lunch serving had two samosas. I had the chicken curry for my first time here. The basmati rice was delicious. My only complaint is that the curry was faaaaar too salty.  I picked the chicken out and left most of the sauce.   I ordered a level two spiciness and shouldve gone with a three without blinking. Two was to mild for me. $12 for lunch and I had leftovers. I'll give them another shot,  but will skip the basic curry."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Best place for desi food in the Madison area I've tried so far. Delicious, flavorful food and generous portions. The ambiance is chic and modern and the staff is really friendly.

We ordered the vegetarian appetizer platter, chicken kabob and spinach paneer. The samosa wasn't excessively spicy and the pakoras were delicious. The spinach had a nice garlicky flavor and the chicken was super tender. Sadly the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night. More folks should check this place out so it will stick around! :-)"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"This was my first time I've had Indian food, so I was skeptical... But this place was so good, I took my boyfriend. He also loved it!  My favorite items on the menu are the garlic naan and chicken Curry #5"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,Great food. Great service. Butter chicken and chicken tikka masala both were amazing. The staff went above and beyond to serve us. Clean and great atmosphere as well. Highly recommend
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"We came here on a Friday night with a craving for some Indian deliciousness and were not disappointed. The lentil soup that comes with the meal was delicious, and both of our meals were awesome. I had the chicken Tika masala and my husband had the butter chicken. We both had spice level 3 which was perfect for him but a little too hot for me. I had garlic naan (yum!) and my husband had a wheat version which was probably healthier but also tasted kinda like cardboard. Both of our dishes reheated well the next day, and the price was great! Very reasonable for the amount of food provided.

Interior was clean and classy, very nice feel for a dinner date. Only complaint was service was pretty slow. Not a deal breaker, but not as fast as other locations in Middleton."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Came for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty busy, but the service was still quite good. The  menu is quite large, with lots of great curry options. Chicken Madras was excellent, but the cheese naan wasn't great."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"A great delicious Indian place in town! I was surprised when I arrived on a Sunday, there was no characteristic aroma nor the classic lunch buffet! Very excited I wouldn't bring the aroma around me after food and sadly feel hungry all the time.... 

We were the first customers at around 11am, the space was wide and you could easily fit large parties of 10 or more. As we went through our lunch, several other tables arrived. We noticed that a couple with a young baby was seated right by the bathroom, placing them further away from other tables; my friends and I thought that was extremely thoughtful of them!

I really enjoyed the food selection, some things are completely new and I have not seen them at other indian restaurants.

Good dishes to try:
Mango lassi - much more yoghurty than other places, actually really refreshing with food!
Meat platter - nice chicken tender-like things, fried fish was nice and flaky. And i love the cracker and sauces to dip on the side
Aloo naan - potato naan sounds weird, but seriously, you'd not go back to regular naan!!
Beef briyani - great flavor, and surprisingly spicy. beef was tender and tasty!
Chicken Makhani - loved the thick tikka masala sauce. very well cooked chicken! love it!

We shared the dishes among 3, and had at least a third of the dishes to bring home as leftovers. Just a note, the dishes were still wonderful after microwaving ;) Finally, be aware of the spiciness level, for Asian tastebuds that eat moderate spicy level, 2 stars is more than enough!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,Nice pleasant family run Indian place with an excellent butter chicken.  I'm going to assume they are Muslims because they serve a couple of very good beef dishes.  If I'm by myself or with other South Asians they will serve it up nice and spicy but they default to too mild if I arrive with even one gora friend.  Decor and ambiance much nicer than the other Indian places I like with food this good.  Easy parking.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"First time going yesterday for lunch. AMAZING, the flavor the service, the price and again the flavor! We had Chicken Kabob's as appetizer, chicken done perfectly and the chutneys that came with it were delicious. We had Chicken Curry and Paneer Masala. The flavors were amazing. And our final bill was so reasonable! We definitely will be going again and again!."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,The food and service was excellent.  Had the Punjabi chicken kabobs for starters followed by Kadahi Chicken.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"It's a nice location , interiors were pretty with good paintings off the wall. Tried the veg thali, meat thali and a few entree of the menu. The chicken tikka and paneer tikka in the thali were delicious and thali were priced at $9 for veg and $10 for meat. Very disappointed with service. The staff is not very friendly. It took a lot of convincing to replace lamb curry for a daal in the meat thali when a few of us didn't eat lamb. The shrimp curry off the menu was a joke. Shrimps warmed up in tomato sauce. The servers mixed up plates with hot and medium spice levels!!! And some of us had to eat super spicy chicken tandoori. It's an average indian restaurant"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Never buy chicken Briyani & chicken curry. I ordered carry out for a dinner. They put big chunks of frozen chicken which was very hard in both. It was same pieces in both Briyani &the curry. We threw it away completely. Come on, I am paying 30 bucks for this, these guys should realize & make something good."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Very much enjoyed my dinner here and left stuffed and had some to take home.  I did a little research and was looking for something different than old 'merican burgers. And I avoid chains as much as possible.
I arrived shortly after they opened for dinner service. Nearly empty.  Nicely decorated, crisp white table cloths, menus and water were quickly delivered.
I've finally eaten at other Indian restaurants with friends enough to go to one by myself and have a darn good understanding of what is on the menu. And fortunately, there is a good description of the dishes on the menu too.
I love chicken tikka masala, but it is such an easy choice, and British, really. So I got an appetizer of paneer pakora. Uh, yum!   And a ton of them. Lightly breaded in (chick pea flour) cheeses layered with a spice.  Came with 3 dipping sauces... tamarind chutney, onion chutney, and mint cilantro.  I ate them all, yes, I did.  For the dinner I chose chicken Shahi Korma.  The first thing I noticed was how tender and flavorful the chicken was. A good amount of chicken. The gravy was rich and delicious. My only complaint is that I think there was maybe one raisin and a couple cashews in the sauces.   I'm not asking for a lot, maybe six of them?    Served with nice basmati rice. You get to pick the level of heat, I asked for medium, I should have asked for a bit more, maybe they thought I couldn't handle it and didn't make it too hot. My nose was a tad runny when I left though, so there was some heat.
After I read the menu later in the evening I came to the conclusion that the dinners are prepared for two.  I made a valiant effort, walked out stuffed and happy.  Hope I get to come back and try more!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Love this place - the food is amazing, staff is friendly, service is quick, there's never a wait for a table, and did I mention the food is amazing?  I've tried several of the chicken curries and they've all been flavorful and the spice level was right where I requested it (medium).  My husband ordered the chicken chili the first time we came, and he can't bring himself to try anything else because he loves the chicken chili so much!  The food comes out piping hot, too.  Also, I left my purse there last night and two waiters came running out to our car to catch us before we left, which was so kind and evidence of their top notch service."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,Beautiful afternoon sitting outdoors at Dhaba. The lunch specials sounded so good that I had a chicken lunch special and my wife had the vegetarian. Both were made to medium spiciness and were served promptly. Cold Indian Kingfisher beer went well with both. AAA+ service. We sat outside and enjoyed the day.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Ambience was nice - modern and immaculately clean, with pleasant decorations.  Service was friendly and efficient, although not very personable.  Food was amazing.  The Vegetable Masala was perfectly spiced, and had a rich creamy curry sauce. The Baingan Bartha (eggplant) was also great, and had a grilled ""open flame"" flavor. Nan was excellent, a bit thicker than most indian restaurants,  not at all greasy and stayed soft even when it got cold. The mixed vegetarian platter appetizer was very good, although the samosa and aloo tikki could have used a touch of spice. Also enjoyed the Vegetable Mango, although would have liked it better if the mango sauce was thicker. At many indian restaurants mango sauce is sweet, at Dhaba the mango sauce had a rich, savory taste.  Nice. Be cautious though about spice level. Medium at most indian restaurants, would be a 2 at Dhaba."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"This weekend we ventured out to an Indian restaurant that has received lots of love from Yelpers. Though a little bit far from where we live, it was worth a trip. Coming at 1145, the restaurant only had some customers inside. I love the ambience and the decoration. Pretty, neat and clean. When we walked to our table, my eyes are set to the announcement on the wall that says: ' if you pay in cash, you'll have a 5%off for lunch and a 10 % off for dinner. Fair enough.
Once we were seated, the waiter came right away and brought the menu. Four of us chose one different dish so we could try four different meals. We had quite a variety of meals: naan garlic, fish vandaloo, chicken curry, shrimp curry, lamb biryani as the main courses. Samosa and lentil soup for appetizers. For the drinks, we had mango lassie and chai. Was a good experience! The price is reasonable too! We'll be back!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"This restaurant is amazing! The service is impeccable, the staff is friendly and the food.... Oh, the food is a crazy good. If it is your first time, I recommend ordering the Paneer Curry dish from the vegetarian menu. You will not be disappointed.

They now offer a 10% discount for cash. Which just upped the appeal of this restaurant."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Although there are several good Indian restaurants in Madison, there are few to none where I actually want to sit down and enjoy a meal.  So I do take out.

Dhaba is the exception with its wide open windows and floor plan, and overall pleasing ambience.  Plus the food was excellent.

The veg samosa was perfectly cooked, and even reheated beautifully in the oven the next evening.  The crust is the tough part with samosas.  These were flaky with no toughness.

The lamb vindaloo was certainly lively, but not too spicy.  (I ordered it medium hot and it came that way--sort of 7 out of 10 on the heat scale.)  The lamb was sufficiently tender which is the first thing I look for in an Indian lamb dish.  I thought the sauce was a bit one-dimensional, but still satisfying.  Could use a side of raita.

The baingan bharta was the best I've had yet.  It had that beautiful mashed consistency with plenty of zing from the garlic, ginger and eggplant.

The chicken spinach dish featured plenty of skinless chicken thigh, almost too much in that I really love that curried Indian spinach sauce with just about anything.  So the chicken kind of dominated the dish.

I ordered ginger naan which was sprinkled with cilantro and was both tasty and useful for sopping up the delicious sauces.

Caution: Yelp had this place listed with a full bar, now corrected, which was wrong.  WIne and beer only.

We will be back when in that part of town.  The ambience and table settings are comfortable.  I won't have my sights set on a Beefeater martini now that I know.  I look forward to exploring more facets of Dhaba's reliable cuisine."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Let me start by saying I'm Indian and a bratty SNOB when it comes to Indian food. My family is Punjabi like the family that owns the restaurant, so I very much appreciated the mostly North Indian menu. 

Food: YUM! We have the Non-Veg appetizer platter (SO GOOD! Keema Samosa was one of the best I've had). We ordered malai kofta, chicken tikka masala with garlic and chicken naan. We later got some Saag (spinach dish) and kheer. 

Naan - We ended up trying garlic, chicken and plain naan. All kind were great! 

Malai Kofta - Best I've had in Madison. I've tried a few other places and they just don't hit the spot the way this one did. 

Chicken Tikka Masala - It's the only chicken dish I think is ever worth ordering at an Indian restaurant. This dish was literally designed for Indian restaurants, it's not authentic to India rather Great Britain.  So I don't bother with anything else. Dhaba's was reallllllly good!

Saag - My mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it. 

Kheer -  I'm not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and I stole my mom's because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. 

We ordered at a spice level 3 and found it perfect. I'm not someone that loves spicy food (ie. Hyderabi, Goan, Pakistani food.. I can't handle you) However, I do like some heat, so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom, sister and myself. My mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that, but she's been cooking without much spice for the past year. 

Restaurant Decor: I really like how they've decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music playing in the background. Totally like a real 'Dhaba' (dhaba's are the Indian version of fast food joints... you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered/tented area.. at least in Punjab & enjoy the whatever deep friend/sloppy delicacy you are offered... usually some sort of comfort food. Back to the review).

Overall this place is awesome! I'm totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them! 

P.S. If you like Taste of India on Monroe street or Brookfield/Fox Valley, the owners family runs those locations as well. 

TWO THUMBS UP!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"The stellar reviews for this place have to be fake. DO NOT go to this place! Mediocre food, and worst of all, mean/petty owner.

I treated my in laws here to their first Indian food (I am Indian), and to their last dinner in Madison. We ordered a lot of food and were supposed to get 5 salads, but only got 4. Then we were just $5 short of the cash discount and the front girl was so mean/unhelpful; she sent us to walk to an atm so far away that we paid in cash after a failed 10 minute walk/run. We were embarrassed in front of my in laws and I was sad that the service was so bad for a place I've been to many times. No special treatment for a regular here!

Dining out at the end of the day is about people, and these folks don't make you feel welcome. It's all about the last penny, and worst of all, by mean/uncaring staff. I wouldn't have been upset if I had to pay the same amount but to a nice and apologetic staff member.

Also: Food is not good. Lots of creamy curry and very, very little meat.  Could not even order a plain lassi, suggesting everything is premade. Naan was okay but too oily. Soup was way too salty and lukewarm. And place is always almost empty (tonight was Saturday at 7-9pm, only one other family) with no music etc.

I was a regular and even considered making them my businesses' regular caterer but won't be back."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"After several years of ordering takeout, I had the pleasure of dining in at Dhaba on an early Saturday afternoon. The space is beautiful; tons of natural light, warm colors, festively folded napkins, and an ambience that is a step closer to fine dining than casual. 

Service: top notch. Truly. Every need we had (which were few due to their anticipatory and attentive service) were attended to, the staff was so warm and welcoming, and they had touches that I'm not used to like waiting politely to set the menus down until I had removed my coat and taken a seat. 

Food: double top notch. I think it's the best Indian food I've had to date. Now, I have to admit that I order chicken tikka masala every time, but that's what I order from every restaurant. I was only half joking when I told my boyfriend I would probably drink the sauce as a straight shot. The chicken is incidental (white meat, tender, good quality); I honestly would be more than happy just dumping the sauce on rice and on naan and calling it a day. Speaking of the naan, it's warm and so soft and, as it turns out, even more delicious when served in house instead of as takeout. 

Dining in we were also offered soup or salad, and we both went with the soup. I believe it was a vegetable lentil; it reminded me of dal. The soup was served at just the right temperature. My boyfriend tried the chicken makhani; rich and chicken-y and a good kick of spice at medium. 

Each of our meals was $8.95, a steal for how much food you get and the wonderful service. I think I'll skip takeout from now on and treat myself to dining in."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,Good Indian food in the vicinity. We tried their weekend thali which we found the portions to be scanty. Also found an eyelash in my rice pudding but I am ready to put it behind me given I ate there twice and wasn't disappointed. I like their dal makhni which may not be matching my high standards of Delhi style dal makhni but still pretty flavorful. Try their lamb over chicken for it is really well done.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"We have a voting system at our workplace that lets people vote on what they want for lunch that day. We try to keep it fair by not allowing a restaurant to win twice in one week. However, if we forget to start a vote, often times we're forced to ""Default Dhaba."" I'm pretty sure those moments of forgetfulness are freudian slips, because we friggin love this place.

Personally, I've found my vice: chicken tikka masala with cheese naan. This amazing combination of bread, cheese, and curry has everything I've ever wanted in a good meal, and then some. I've found some other indian places that have similarly good masala, but the naan stands apart. No other Indian restaurant I've visited has come close to the wonderous naan found at Dhaba."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Dhaba Indian Bistro is a great choice for an Indian meal, and the quality is consistent whether you are eating in or taking out. The staff is always friendly and happy to make recommendations. The interior is clean and inviting, although there is a strange round table to the right of the welcome desk, and I would avoid that on a windy or rainy day. The portions are ample and delicious. Having tried many of their curries, I'm confident in recommending almost anything here.

Let me recommend the Chicken Makhani. It's naturally quite spicy, and as someone who normally likes spice at a 4 on a 5 star level, I always have the makhani at a 2 Dhaba. The garlic naan are always a hit too.

The only dish I have tried that I didn't care for was a lamb curry. I found the lamb to be fatty and I really didn't enjoy it. I haven't tried it since, so I couldn't tell you if it was a one off. I can confidently say that the chicken is consistently high quality.

Top tip?! 10% discount from the price of your dinner either eat-in or take-out when you pay cash!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"For all the people stating that this is the best Indian food in Madison, I can only assume that they have not ever been to Maharaja. Or Swagat. Maharaja is the best Indian restaurant in Madison, and we have been going there for years. But to keep an open mind, we have tried Dhaba twice in the past month. 

First of all, the place itself is nicely decorated, and the service is excellent. The waitstaff are polite and attentive, and there are plenty of them. But the food is just not that good (other than the Naan). 

Every entree comes with either soup or salad. We have gotten their lentil soup both times, which is buttery, thin, and tastes very little like lentils. However, it's not bad, just not very interesting or lentil-y.

For main courses, we have had the Chicken Shahikorma and the Chicken Tikka Masala, as well as the Spinach (ie Palak) Paneer (a combo of spinach and farmer's cheese-like cubes) and Spinach Aloo (spinach with potatoes). 

The first time we tried the Chicken Shahikorma, I was suspicious that the base of it was actually canned tomato soup with a few spices added. Seriously. It was a very thin sauce, with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken breast in it. But the sauce was not like any shahikorma I've ever had, and it was not interesting. The second time we came we had the Chicken Tikka Masala, and strangely enough, it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma. The two dishes should not, repeat not, have the same sauce. And the Chicken Tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the Tandoor oven, but there was no evidence that it had been. We felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce. They should not. 

The spinach dishes were ok, except the potatoes in the Spinach Aloo were undercooked - as in crunchy. I didn't eat them. 

The Naan is great, I admit. But the rest just is not that good. Seriously, if folks want really good Indian, go to Maharaja and get the Chicken Shahikorma or Tikka there."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"You MUST try this place. Being from NYC I am spoiled by the food and authenticity of Indian food so I am a sceptic when it comes to Indian food when I travel. 

I can't say enough good things about the flavor and food overall. I typically get chicken curry, chicken Tika or chicken marsala but tonight I tried something new....chicken kadahi. Yummmmm! 
I like spicy. I asked for a spice level of 4 out of 5 (just in case they were actually spicy) but I say it was more of a 2 for me. So, if you like spicy....go for it.

BTW, if you pay cash you get 5% off at lunch and 10% at dinner. Nice!!!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"We've been coming here for about 2 years, sometimes we drive to Madison just to come here for lunch! We have been known to come 2 times in one week because the food has always been great! I myself always get their beef masala! The beef is always so tender that you can shred it with a fork. The masala sauce it's self has just the right amount of spice and the color is a creamy red. My husband always gets their chicken byriyani and loves it! He said that the chicken is always so tender and you get big chuncks. The sizes of both meals are great for what you pay for. We also get the garlic naan, and it has so much garlic flavor. 

The staff are always friendly and helpful. The owner has talked to us about recipes and just about anything else! They have a running special that if you pay cash for your meal you get 10% off for lunch and 20.% off for dinner."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"One of the most tastiest and affordable Indian restaurants I've been to in the MidWest. The ambience was fantastic, clean and no-nonsense. The mixed meat thali had generous portions of chicken and goat which surprised me. For 2 entrees with a tip it cost me about $30, which in my opinion a real good deal."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"On a recent search for a great local indian restaurant we discovered two within a mile of our house...both are great but this one is our new favorite!  Easy to miss from the street, it's worth the search to find.  We have been back twice and service has always been prompt and personable.  The food is equally fantastic!  My husband is a huge fan of their tandori chicken and myself love their mango chicken and chicken tikka masala.  The ""dinner for two"" is a great deal and a fun way to try a few entrees too.  The naan was also great as well as their lentil soup.  We are looking forward to going back!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken curry,"Probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to taste. To think it's located in the middle of Wisconsin, really sucks because I really dig this place. Anyhow they do serve alcohol here, which helps for most of you reading this review :).  
Let me get the negative out of here, I felt the service was pretty slow, like I had to flag down the waiter. there seemed to be a language barrier, but the other waiters that came around were hard to get a hold of but there was no barrier in communication.....and heck I speak all the langs they speak here lol Go figure! so when I saw communication barrier, I mean it!

Oh and ummm they could spice up the decor lol

Very Important !! They give you the option of picking the level of spice from 1 to 5. We had the food at level 3 and it was perfect to me, I could have gone up to level 4 but I wanted to share the cuisine with my one of my colleagues, he had level 3 for his dishes..... he was sweating profusely but said it was amazing. So if you dare or are tempted try level 4 or 5 :)!!! Lemme know how it goes!

First time ever I had the Dhaba Biryani that had shrimp, chicken, beef , and Lamb.... and the flavors were on point. Usually when you put those all in a combination they tend to clash and not be to appetizing. You won't regret ordering it......unless you can't handle spice :). Still craving it til this day. 

I miss Dhaba already, if you live in the greater Wisconsin area you gota excuse to go to the middle of no where and give this place a shot.

EnjoY the pics and the Videos !"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"My favorite Indian food in Madison. I've tried many dishes here, chicken and vegetarian, as well as many of the appetizers, breads, and chutneys. Everything is excellent. Some favorites include the chicken shahi korma, muttar paneer, vegetable samosa, and garlic naan. I enjoy the professionalism of staff and owners. A really nice dining experience whether at lunch or dinner."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"This is probably the best Indian restaurant I've been to, i would definitely recommend it.  I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was delicious. Affordable prices and good service as well. They were very helpful for explaining what a lot of the food on the menu was."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"I have had nothing but amazing food and fabulous service here. My favorites include the Tandori Mixed Grill, Chicken Madras, and Chicken Tika Masala. Be sure to try the peshwari naan-a sweet kick to the traditional naan. You will quickly become a regular. :)"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"All potential for disappointment gets checked at the door and never makes it inside. The friendly owners, portion-to-price ratio and succulent entrees make this place 5-star awesome, a must for anyone who enjoys Indian food. This time while I waited, the owner told me all about Uttarayan, one of India's many major festivals. 

I brought home the chicken tikka masala (wife's favorite) and the chicken vindaloo, along with the veggie appetizer sampler. The samosas are a personal fav and I get those every time, if for no other reason than the sampler of sauces they serve with them. Nirvana for me would mean being dipped in those sauces. Please don't eat me though. The pakoras (fried veggies in a hummus batter) are also perfectly dippable and probably taste slightly better than I do.  

For entrees, I ordered the masala mild, but would step that up a notch next time. The vindaloo was medium-plus spicy and perfect -- just spicy enough to make my forehead sweat but not so spicy as to dominate the flavor. The chicken in both entrees was tender white meat, expertly cooked. 

Eat here. You won't regret it."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Ordered delivery, and it took an hour and a half on a Tuesday night.  Delivery driver blamed it on having to wait on the restaurant - but I'm not completely certain where the disconnect was since my hotel is within walking distance.  Chicken Korma was the blandest I have ever eaten - but the Chicken Tikki Masala was very redeeming.  I ordered both at medium heat, so it was really surprising to have one be so flavorful and the other so bland.  Naan was very cold by the time my order arrived.  May try dining in next time - difficult to discern quality when I'm not sure how long the food sat prior to delivery.  I would NOT recommend ordering delivery to anyone else."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"My boyfriend introduced me to Dhaba Indian Bistro a few months back and I have been a fan ever since. I have yet to have a bad experience with either the food or service. The staff is very friendly and definitely remember regular customers 

I really enjoy the basmati rice. One thing that I do like about Dhaba over my favorite lunch spot Curry in the Box is that they do not use jasmine rice. While I do like jasmine rice, the basmati rice is a better fit for the curry. Long grain rice blends very well with the thickness of the curry. 

They offer a large variety of curries ranges from types of curry's and spice levels. The work on a 1-5 scale of spiciness, with 5 being the hottest. Let me just say that I have gotten a yellow shrimp curry dish on a 2 scale and it was spicy so be warned. A scale of 1 is your safest bet. My boyfriend who loves spicy food can barely withstand a 3.

They offer quite a bit of curries, shrimp, chicken, beef, lamb, goat, etc. I must admit that I am not the biggest fan of their cheese roti bread. I definitely prefer Curry in the Box roti bread over Dhaba, however, Dhaba's bread is more thicker making it easy to dip the bread into the curry and eat. 


Their prices do go up during dinner. Even though I've only gone during their lunch hours, I was told by a regular that their serving sizes aren't any different from lunch to dinner so keep that in mind. 

It's a nice outing for people who really enjoy Indian food and/or curry. I know for some people, the smell of curry really turns them away from eating at places like such but the restaurant does a great job with ""hiding"" the smells. Curry can be very overwhelming but the aroma when you dine ad Dhaba is very inviting."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"I really like this place because the food is really that good and it's very close to my house. The restaurant seems very clean, the decor and music are pleasant. They use white linen on the tables which I think gives a good touch. I always get the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. My mom gets the lamb curry with soup. Super delicious!  I like it better than swagat in middleton. The employees are very nice. One time I had to wait extra long for take out and they gave me complimentary glass of wine."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,Great northern Indian food. Outstanding take out and dine in many options. Authentic and homestyle Indian food like mom would make! Highly recommend the chicken tikka and paneer tikka as well as any of their tandoori dishes and appetizers are good also. Wide variety of meat chicken vegetarian options for all courses.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Get ready for some real good Indian food. It would be unrealistic of me to expect 100% authentic Indian taste that you can only find in India, but this place is pretty close to being authentic, which is great because even this level of similarity is hard to find.
What stood out, was their keema naan, malai kofta and butter chicken. Best thing about Indian restaurants are that they have excellent variety of vegetarian dishes. Paneer makhni here was out of the box. Naan/breads were very very fresh, seemed like straight outa oven. We ordered keema naan, garlic naan, spinach naan, butter naan and regular naan and all were good.
Good service too, we ordered their veggie vindaloo and found it to be very tangy letting them know about it, their manager replaced it with another dish. 
Good ambience, great food, good service, clean bathroom, Overall a great experience."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Let me say up front that I'm stingy with the stars. As far as the food is concerned, it was very good. I think a four or five star rating needs to have ""great"" food. The ambience was nice, and the decor was fresh and modern. It's always nice to see white linen tablecloths in a restaurant. 

I usually order Tikki Masala when I eat Indian food, but wanted something different today. The server thoughtfully suggested several options and I settled on the chicken madras. I liked it. It wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped, but it was a good choice. I come away pleased with my choice to eat here. 

Also, they offer a discount to pay in cash."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"This Indian food is great, consistent, and delicious. Jump in and start eating!

When Dhaba opened in Middleton, it became our weekly take-out option. I've never actually been to the restaurant as my co-worker always makes the pickup. 

Over the last six months we have rated each dish to our preferences. Here is our list of the best tasting meals that we've had. Sadly, we have not yet eaten our way through the whole menu. As long as Dhaba makes food, we'll continue eating our way through the menu. We've gone heavy on the lamb and vegetarian dishes and skipped most of the chicken and beef. That said, here is our list of favorite dishes. All dishes with an asterisk are my personal favs*.

Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"This Place is so close to my office that it was inevitable to try. so glad i did, the best, most flavorful dishes are served here. the cheese naan, although not too traditional-Indian, is the best I've ever had. their chicken Masala is also incredible. The price is right for on the go lunches with generous portions. a bit overpriced for dinner with same menu/portions as lunch, and that's why they get 4 stars!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"This was our first time visiting and it definitely won't be our last. Very nice dining area, modern and clean. Our waiter was very attentive and took good care of us. We appreciate the hospitality. 

Great selection of drinks and the food menu was extensive. Everything looked good, so it was hard to decide. We started with the lamb samosas. Really delicious. I think next time we'll get the traditional and lamb together. Ordered some cheese naan, which came along with our meals. The shrimp curry and lamb masala were absolutely amazing. The flavor of all the sauces were so complex and tasty. We decided on a ""3"" level for heat. The basmati rice was so light and perfect. 

Everything was perfect. I have no complaints what so ever. Thank you."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,We ordered from here this past Wednesday and the Chicken Tiki Masala was tender and juicy. The naan was still warm and soft. The rice topped off our meal. I eat Indian in several cities I travel too and this was one of the better places. A nice surprise!
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"First, great atmosphere and service. A great place for a business lunch or date night.  Samosas were large and well executed with potato and peas in the filling and three sauces. The lunch serving had two samosas. I had the chicken curry for my first time here. The basmati rice was delicious. My only complaint is that the curry was faaaaar too salty.  I picked the chicken out and left most of the sauce.   I ordered a level two spiciness and shouldve gone with a three without blinking. Two was to mild for me. $12 for lunch and I had leftovers. I'll give them another shot,  but will skip the basic curry."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Best Indian food in Madison! Haven't had a bad dish on the menu. Very friendly staff! Had many birthday and graduation parties there. Give it a shot. Tikka is very good, Rogan Josh is great too"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Excellent food, attentive staff. I really enjoyed all the vegetarian options, the vegetables masala was flavorful without being too greasy. The vegetarian appetizer platter was perfect for 2 people, lots of food and variety and everything was super tasty. I felt very lucky to eat on the patio there, today as well. The garlic naan was great. I didn't feel like we overpaid."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Another delicious meal, this time with Tariq by my side. He really enjoyed his food but will never stop measuring the food against the incredible delights at Anmol in Milwaukee. That said, Dhaba did just fine. 
We were both over-hungry after spending a couple hours at Shoe Box. We had the Allo Tikki Chat to start. Chana Masala and a yummy potato mash together with some sauce. For entrees we had Lamb Bhartha and Paneer Masala. There was loads of tender lamb in a wonderful sauce. The paneer are squares of homemade cheese in a creamy masala sauce. Both were perfectly seasoned to the medium spicy we requested. We also had the naan that was soft and tasty.
Tariq had chai which was excellent, not too sweet and I had a Mud Puppy, dark beer. The beer was a good compliment to the spicy food. 
The service was excellent. I would have liked a little time to finish my appetizer before the entree arrived. Final bill $47 with a full meal of leftovers to go. 10% discount for cash.
We shall return. Get the to the Dhaba. No excuse not to."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Best place for desi food in the Madison area I've tried so far. Delicious, flavorful food and generous portions. The ambiance is chic and modern and the staff is really friendly.

We ordered the vegetarian appetizer platter, chicken kabob and spinach paneer. The samosa wasn't excessively spicy and the pakoras were delicious. The spinach had a nice garlicky flavor and the chicken was super tender. Sadly the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night. More folks should check this place out so it will stick around! :-)"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"We decided to try it because of the good reviews it's been receiving and we were VERY impressed! I don't pretend to be an expert on Indian food, but this is the best I've ever had. I used to go to Swagat (which is also good), and there were a few Indian places I frequented when I lived in Denver, but this blew them away,

The Garlic Naan bread is a MUST, we're still craving it today. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala on a recommendation and it was awesome and my wife ordered the Beef Mushroom which was also excellent. We ordered take-out and the food was ready very quickly and it's also very reasonably priced. Plus, they give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash.

We have a 1 year old and are always looking for good take-out options, Dhaba might have just jumped to the top of the list!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"The atmosphere, service and food was absolutely amazing. I ordered lamb masala, chicken tikka masala and paneer for an appetizer. All of the food was very flavorful and did not disappoint."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Gave Dhaba a try when we were in Middleton and so glad we did. My wife and I shared a veggie pakora appetizer that was very refreshing and tasty. My wife ordered the tikka masala with soup. And I ordered the veggie vindaloo. The vindaloo was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. My wife absolutely loved her masala. We shared some garlic naan that was brought out freshly made. The soup was also very flavorful and enjoyable. Washed it all down with a mango lasi. They also give you a discount if you pay in cash. The lunch prices are a pretty good value, considering you are getting everything made to order. We prefer going here for lunch than many of the other buffet style restaurants that are scattered throughout Madison. The staff are also very attentive and helpful in explaining anything on the menu. There spicy scale is pretty spot on as well."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"All you need to know about this place is that it's wonderful. The tikka masala is the best I've ever had and their garlic naan is second to naan (haha...get it? I had to) Anyway, dinner is a tiny bit pricey, but if you just order an extra rice and 2 orders of naan with one entree, it's PLENTY of food and a great price!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,Great food. Great service. Butter chicken and chicken tikka masala both were amazing. The staff went above and beyond to serve us. Clean and great atmosphere as well. Highly recommend
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"I just died and went to Indian food heaven. Seriously though, if I were on death row (that would suck but...)this would come a very close second to my family's homemade Cincinnati chili. In the US it's very difficult to find the quality of Indian food you will find in the UK.  Yes, the UK where I believe Chicken Tikka Masala is going to be declared the national dish over fish and chips! You cannot turn a corner without smelling the Indian food bliss slap you in the face. AND finally! I have found an Indian restaurant that has met their match in the US of 'Merica! Dhaba Indian Bistro is ah-mazing! So what was for dinner you ask? Lobster Madras with Garlic Naan. No, Lobster Madras (a little spicier and more flavorful in my mouth) was not on the menu.....but they made it. No questions asked. I knew the Vindaloo was too spicy and the Masala too weak for my buds so...they just smiled and brought out a beautiful dish full of those Indian flavors I have missed so much. Too bad they're not in my hometown; I'd be there once a week...minimum."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"We came here on a Friday night with a craving for some Indian deliciousness and were not disappointed. The lentil soup that comes with the meal was delicious, and both of our meals were awesome. I had the chicken Tika masala and my husband had the butter chicken. We both had spice level 3 which was perfect for him but a little too hot for me. I had garlic naan (yum!) and my husband had a wheat version which was probably healthier but also tasted kinda like cardboard. Both of our dishes reheated well the next day, and the price was great! Very reasonable for the amount of food provided.

Interior was clean and classy, very nice feel for a dinner date. Only complaint was service was pretty slow. Not a deal breaker, but not as fast as other locations in Middleton."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"This was the first place I ever had Indian food. I GREATLY enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala. I went back quite a few times because I worked across the street. I've since had other Indian places and I can say this is the best I've had yet. The cheese naan was on point. The service was superb. Very friendly always. They even let us know that they have ""off the charts"" spicy. The hottest they have would rate maybe a 2 on the Thai spice level. So if you request off the charts they give you some extra spice to add on your own."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"A great delicious Indian place in town! I was surprised when I arrived on a Sunday, there was no characteristic aroma nor the classic lunch buffet! Very excited I wouldn't bring the aroma around me after food and sadly feel hungry all the time.... 

We were the first customers at around 11am, the space was wide and you could easily fit large parties of 10 or more. As we went through our lunch, several other tables arrived. We noticed that a couple with a young baby was seated right by the bathroom, placing them further away from other tables; my friends and I thought that was extremely thoughtful of them!

I really enjoyed the food selection, some things are completely new and I have not seen them at other indian restaurants.

Good dishes to try:
Mango lassi - much more yoghurty than other places, actually really refreshing with food!
Meat platter - nice chicken tender-like things, fried fish was nice and flaky. And i love the cracker and sauces to dip on the side
Aloo naan - potato naan sounds weird, but seriously, you'd not go back to regular naan!!
Beef briyani - great flavor, and surprisingly spicy. beef was tender and tasty!
Chicken Makhani - loved the thick tikka masala sauce. very well cooked chicken! love it!

We shared the dishes among 3, and had at least a third of the dishes to bring home as leftovers. Just a note, the dishes were still wonderful after microwaving ;) Finally, be aware of the spiciness level, for Asian tastebuds that eat moderate spicy level, 2 stars is more than enough!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,Nice pleasant family run Indian place with an excellent butter chicken.  I'm going to assume they are Muslims because they serve a couple of very good beef dishes.  If I'm by myself or with other South Asians they will serve it up nice and spicy but they default to too mild if I arrive with even one gora friend.  Decor and ambiance much nicer than the other Indian places I like with food this good.  Easy parking.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"The chicken tikka masala is a great favorite.  My two kids (ages 4 and 7) eat it like it's ice cream. 
The restaurant was hopping...a great new Indian restaurant on the west side."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"I stopped at Dhaba for the first time this week.  On the good side, the restaurant looks very good and the staff is courteous and efficient.  Also, our naan bread was delicious.  On the bad side, the very bad side, the lamb vindaloo was inedible.  It appeared to be canned tomato soup, slightly spiced and heated with some lamb dropped in.  Terrible!  The chicken tikka masala was barely passable.  I think the sauce also came from a jar, at least it tasted like it.  

I cannot recommend this restaurant for anything other than naan.  If you want Indian, any other Indian restaurant in town would be better."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,The food and service was excellent.  Had the Punjabi chicken kabobs for starters followed by Kadahi Chicken.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Perhaps I am being overly critical of Dhaba or perhaps their quality has slipped. My mother and I were craving Indian but didn't want to do the Swagat buffet so we decided to check out Dhaba. Of course every Indian restaurant has their 5 star dishes but I can sadly say that what we ordered wasn't 5 star quality. Was it edible for me yes, however, my mother stated multiple times that her beef masala was inedible. In fact, she stated that she had never tasted meat like that which was in the masala and even compared it to organ meat. After being extremely turned off by this I was reluctant to try it. However, I can tell you that my paneer masala was a solid 3 stars. The panner cubes were exactly as one might expect but the sauce to paneer ratio left much to be desired. That being said, the rice was perfect and the sauce was tasty. Was it the best masala that I have ever had? No, but it was far from the worst either.

In addition to having the entrees, the lunches were also served with a small soup or salad. We both opted for the lentil soup and a side order of cheese naan. Both were solid but nothing special. The lentil soup was bland but edible and the naan was a solid waste of calories.

For the $9 or $10 price tag per entree, Dhaba is definitely at the top of the Madison Indian food spectrum for lunch especially since even plain naan is extra. I happen to love Indian food quite a bit and often have to resist licking the bowl clean. However, Dhaba left much to be desired and I can say that I won't be going back with the better options around the Madison area."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,So glad we found a good Indian restaurant in our area! Woo hoo! We order the fish masala (medium spicy) and the chole with garlic naan and it is soooo delicious. The prices are reasonable and the food is so flavorful! Also they are very quick when we call to order takeout so we have been very pleased.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,Probably the most expensive Briyani and not worth of the cost. We got chicken and lamb briyani. And all tasted like common (Maggi) masala. Definitely not worth for the price.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,My boyfriend and I absolutely love this restaurant! The service is quick and the wait staff is very friendly and professional. Try the garlic nann - it has cilantro. I usually get the chicken tikka masala. You can order the food from mild to spicy on a scale of 1-5.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"It's a nice location , interiors were pretty with good paintings off the wall. Tried the veg thali, meat thali and a few entree of the menu. The chicken tikka and paneer tikka in the thali were delicious and thali were priced at $9 for veg and $10 for meat. Very disappointed with service. The staff is not very friendly. It took a lot of convincing to replace lamb curry for a daal in the meat thali when a few of us didn't eat lamb. The shrimp curry off the menu was a joke. Shrimps warmed up in tomato sauce. The servers mixed up plates with hot and medium spice levels!!! And some of us had to eat super spicy chicken tandoori. It's an average indian restaurant"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Very much enjoyed my dinner here and left stuffed and had some to take home.  I did a little research and was looking for something different than old 'merican burgers. And I avoid chains as much as possible.
I arrived shortly after they opened for dinner service. Nearly empty.  Nicely decorated, crisp white table cloths, menus and water were quickly delivered.
I've finally eaten at other Indian restaurants with friends enough to go to one by myself and have a darn good understanding of what is on the menu. And fortunately, there is a good description of the dishes on the menu too.
I love chicken tikka masala, but it is such an easy choice, and British, really. So I got an appetizer of paneer pakora. Uh, yum!   And a ton of them. Lightly breaded in (chick pea flour) cheeses layered with a spice.  Came with 3 dipping sauces... tamarind chutney, onion chutney, and mint cilantro.  I ate them all, yes, I did.  For the dinner I chose chicken Shahi Korma.  The first thing I noticed was how tender and flavorful the chicken was. A good amount of chicken. The gravy was rich and delicious. My only complaint is that I think there was maybe one raisin and a couple cashews in the sauces.   I'm not asking for a lot, maybe six of them?    Served with nice basmati rice. You get to pick the level of heat, I asked for medium, I should have asked for a bit more, maybe they thought I couldn't handle it and didn't make it too hot. My nose was a tad runny when I left though, so there was some heat.
After I read the menu later in the evening I came to the conclusion that the dinners are prepared for two.  I made a valiant effort, walked out stuffed and happy.  Hope I get to come back and try more!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Love this place - the food is amazing, staff is friendly, service is quick, there's never a wait for a table, and did I mention the food is amazing?  I've tried several of the chicken curries and they've all been flavorful and the spice level was right where I requested it (medium).  My husband ordered the chicken chili the first time we came, and he can't bring himself to try anything else because he loves the chicken chili so much!  The food comes out piping hot, too.  Also, I left my purse there last night and two waiters came running out to our car to catch us before we left, which was so kind and evidence of their top notch service."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,Beautiful afternoon sitting outdoors at Dhaba. The lunch specials sounded so good that I had a chicken lunch special and my wife had the vegetarian. Both were made to medium spiciness and were served promptly. Cold Indian Kingfisher beer went well with both. AAA+ service. We sat outside and enjoyed the day.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Great Indian?  My favorite part of this restaurant is their lunch menu (they don't do buffets) it is so affordable, so you can take multiple items home to try!  For under $30, my hubby and I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Shrimp Vindaloo, Lamb Biryani (rice dish), garlic naan, plan naan, and extra raita.  All meals come with their cumin toasted basmati rice!  We have enough for at least another meal and half!  I am so excited they opened.  Haven't ate in yet, dinning room looks nice and staff is always wonderful during counter service."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"We are always looking for a good Indian restaurant; Dhaba is okay, but I'm not sure we'd make a special trip to go there again.

We began with samosas this is maybe my favorite appetizer, snack there is. Theirs, however, was not up to par at all. First, they came out way too soon, which means they were made previously and reheated (we were there for an early dinner as we did not have lunch). They were on the greasy side, but the worst part was the taste. They had no spice whatsoever. I've had samosas just about in every major city in the country that has a population of people from southeast Asia--and I expected some spice. They were so bland, it was like eating mash potatoes in a pastry (and very little texture as well). I do want to say that when we sent the back, they were taken off of our bill.

The rest of the meal fared better; my husband and I shared an order of Chicken Tikka Masala, which was flavorful. We also shared the Vegetable Mix Curry, which also was good. The nan was a tad on the greasy side and cooled off very quickly, becoming a cracker. 

I think we're still looking for that amazing Indian restaurant..."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Although there are several good Indian restaurants in Madison, there are few to none where I actually want to sit down and enjoy a meal.  So I do take out.

Dhaba is the exception with its wide open windows and floor plan, and overall pleasing ambience.  Plus the food was excellent.

The veg samosa was perfectly cooked, and even reheated beautifully in the oven the next evening.  The crust is the tough part with samosas.  These were flaky with no toughness.

The lamb vindaloo was certainly lively, but not too spicy.  (I ordered it medium hot and it came that way--sort of 7 out of 10 on the heat scale.)  The lamb was sufficiently tender which is the first thing I look for in an Indian lamb dish.  I thought the sauce was a bit one-dimensional, but still satisfying.  Could use a side of raita.

The baingan bharta was the best I've had yet.  It had that beautiful mashed consistency with plenty of zing from the garlic, ginger and eggplant.

The chicken spinach dish featured plenty of skinless chicken thigh, almost too much in that I really love that curried Indian spinach sauce with just about anything.  So the chicken kind of dominated the dish.

I ordered ginger naan which was sprinkled with cilantro and was both tasty and useful for sopping up the delicious sauces.

Caution: Yelp had this place listed with a full bar, now corrected, which was wrong.  WIne and beer only.

We will be back when in that part of town.  The ambience and table settings are comfortable.  I won't have my sights set on a Beefeater martini now that I know.  I look forward to exploring more facets of Dhaba's reliable cuisine."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Samosas Chat, shrimp vindaloo, garlic naan, spinach chicken, chicken tikka masala and Dahba special were all excellent. Friendly service as well."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Let me start by saying I'm Indian and a bratty SNOB when it comes to Indian food. My family is Punjabi like the family that owns the restaurant, so I very much appreciated the mostly North Indian menu. 

Food: YUM! We have the Non-Veg appetizer platter (SO GOOD! Keema Samosa was one of the best I've had). We ordered malai kofta, chicken tikka masala with garlic and chicken naan. We later got some Saag (spinach dish) and kheer. 

Naan - We ended up trying garlic, chicken and plain naan. All kind were great! 

Malai Kofta - Best I've had in Madison. I've tried a few other places and they just don't hit the spot the way this one did. 

Chicken Tikka Masala - It's the only chicken dish I think is ever worth ordering at an Indian restaurant. This dish was literally designed for Indian restaurants, it's not authentic to India rather Great Britain.  So I don't bother with anything else. Dhaba's was reallllllly good!

Saag - My mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it. 

Kheer -  I'm not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and I stole my mom's because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy. 

We ordered at a spice level 3 and found it perfect. I'm not someone that loves spicy food (ie. Hyderabi, Goan, Pakistani food.. I can't handle you) However, I do like some heat, so the 3 was honestly just perfect for my mom, sister and myself. My mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that, but she's been cooking without much spice for the past year. 

Restaurant Decor: I really like how they've decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music playing in the background. Totally like a real 'Dhaba' (dhaba's are the Indian version of fast food joints... you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered/tented area.. at least in Punjab & enjoy the whatever deep friend/sloppy delicacy you are offered... usually some sort of comfort food. Back to the review).

Overall this place is awesome! I'm totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them! 

P.S. If you like Taste of India on Monroe street or Brookfield/Fox Valley, the owners family runs those locations as well. 

TWO THUMBS UP!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"I've had take out from Dhaba three times and each time the food is absolutely amazing!  In the past I've had their Aloo Naan, Spinach Naan, Lamb Masala, Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Shahi Korma...all perfectly tasty.  Today I ordered Chicken Madras, Garlic Naan,and the Mix Vegeterian Platter to go. After picking up the order and opening the bag at my office, I realized the rice was missing.  I called the restaurant and they offered to deliver the rice immediately, even though I offered to pick it up. The gentleman that delivered the rice also included a delicious dessert, which I think was Kheer.  Talk about amazing service!  The food is very flavorful and of high quality.  The staff is always friendly and I've always received amazing service.  I can't wait to go back!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"I was on this side of town for work, heard good things about Dhaba Bistro and thought I should check it out.  I decided to get take out for lunch. The staff there were very friendly. I went with the Vegetarian Masala. It was very tasty. It had peas, potato, sweet potato, carrots, and onions.  The sauce was a creamy tomato based sauce.  I really enjoyed the flavor.  I would say the 2nd best Masala that I've had in the Madison area.  I also got an order of their Naan.  I found it to be overly greasy. Their prices are comparable to other Indian restaurants in the area.
Will get food again here when I'm in the area!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"After several years of ordering takeout, I had the pleasure of dining in at Dhaba on an early Saturday afternoon. The space is beautiful; tons of natural light, warm colors, festively folded napkins, and an ambience that is a step closer to fine dining than casual. 

Service: top notch. Truly. Every need we had (which were few due to their anticipatory and attentive service) were attended to, the staff was so warm and welcoming, and they had touches that I'm not used to like waiting politely to set the menus down until I had removed my coat and taken a seat. 

Food: double top notch. I think it's the best Indian food I've had to date. Now, I have to admit that I order chicken tikka masala every time, but that's what I order from every restaurant. I was only half joking when I told my boyfriend I would probably drink the sauce as a straight shot. The chicken is incidental (white meat, tender, good quality); I honestly would be more than happy just dumping the sauce on rice and on naan and calling it a day. Speaking of the naan, it's warm and so soft and, as it turns out, even more delicious when served in house instead of as takeout. 

Dining in we were also offered soup or salad, and we both went with the soup. I believe it was a vegetable lentil; it reminded me of dal. The soup was served at just the right temperature. My boyfriend tried the chicken makhani; rich and chicken-y and a good kick of spice at medium. 

Each of our meals was $8.95, a steal for how much food you get and the wonderful service. I think I'll skip takeout from now on and treat myself to dining in."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,Good Indian food in the vicinity. We tried their weekend thali which we found the portions to be scanty. Also found an eyelash in my rice pudding but I am ready to put it behind me given I ate there twice and wasn't disappointed. I like their dal makhni which may not be matching my high standards of Delhi style dal makhni but still pretty flavorful. Try their lamb over chicken for it is really well done.
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"We have a voting system at our workplace that lets people vote on what they want for lunch that day. We try to keep it fair by not allowing a restaurant to win twice in one week. However, if we forget to start a vote, often times we're forced to ""Default Dhaba."" I'm pretty sure those moments of forgetfulness are freudian slips, because we friggin love this place.

Personally, I've found my vice: chicken tikka masala with cheese naan. This amazing combination of bread, cheese, and curry has everything I've ever wanted in a good meal, and then some. I've found some other indian places that have similarly good masala, but the naan stands apart. No other Indian restaurant I've visited has come close to the wonderous naan found at Dhaba."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Dhaba Indian Bistro is a great choice for an Indian meal, and the quality is consistent whether you are eating in or taking out. The staff is always friendly and happy to make recommendations. The interior is clean and inviting, although there is a strange round table to the right of the welcome desk, and I would avoid that on a windy or rainy day. The portions are ample and delicious. Having tried many of their curries, I'm confident in recommending almost anything here.

Let me recommend the Chicken Makhani. It's naturally quite spicy, and as someone who normally likes spice at a 4 on a 5 star level, I always have the makhani at a 2 Dhaba. The garlic naan are always a hit too.

The only dish I have tried that I didn't care for was a lamb curry. I found the lamb to be fatty and I really didn't enjoy it. I haven't tried it since, so I couldn't tell you if it was a one off. I can confidently say that the chicken is consistently high quality.

Top tip?! 10% discount from the price of your dinner either eat-in or take-out when you pay cash!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Delicious food, beautiful decor, and really good service. My wife and I ordered the non-vegetarian dinner for two and everything was fantastic, with the exception of the lamb curry, which was a little too tomato-y for me. I especially loved the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Kheer. Also, phenomenal mango and strawberry lassi. Our new favorite Indian place in the Madison area. Be warned, the dinner for two is more like a dinner for three, it's a lot."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"For all the people stating that this is the best Indian food in Madison, I can only assume that they have not ever been to Maharaja. Or Swagat. Maharaja is the best Indian restaurant in Madison, and we have been going there for years. But to keep an open mind, we have tried Dhaba twice in the past month. 

First of all, the place itself is nicely decorated, and the service is excellent. The waitstaff are polite and attentive, and there are plenty of them. But the food is just not that good (other than the Naan). 

Every entree comes with either soup or salad. We have gotten their lentil soup both times, which is buttery, thin, and tastes very little like lentils. However, it's not bad, just not very interesting or lentil-y.

For main courses, we have had the Chicken Shahikorma and the Chicken Tikka Masala, as well as the Spinach (ie Palak) Paneer (a combo of spinach and farmer's cheese-like cubes) and Spinach Aloo (spinach with potatoes). 

The first time we tried the Chicken Shahikorma, I was suspicious that the base of it was actually canned tomato soup with a few spices added. Seriously. It was a very thin sauce, with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken breast in it. But the sauce was not like any shahikorma I've ever had, and it was not interesting. The second time we came we had the Chicken Tikka Masala, and strangely enough, it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma. The two dishes should not, repeat not, have the same sauce. And the Chicken Tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the Tandoor oven, but there was no evidence that it had been. We felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce. They should not. 

The spinach dishes were ok, except the potatoes in the Spinach Aloo were undercooked - as in crunchy. I didn't eat them. 

The Naan is great, I admit. But the rest just is not that good. Seriously, if folks want really good Indian, go to Maharaja and get the Chicken Shahikorma or Tikka there."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"We've been coming here for about 2 years, sometimes we drive to Madison just to come here for lunch! We have been known to come 2 times in one week because the food has always been great! I myself always get their beef masala! The beef is always so tender that you can shred it with a fork. The masala sauce it's self has just the right amount of spice and the color is a creamy red. My husband always gets their chicken byriyani and loves it! He said that the chicken is always so tender and you get big chuncks. The sizes of both meals are great for what you pay for. We also get the garlic naan, and it has so much garlic flavor. 

The staff are always friendly and helpful. The owner has talked to us about recipes and just about anything else! They have a running special that if you pay cash for your meal you get 10% off for lunch and 20.% off for dinner."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"One of the most tastiest and affordable Indian restaurants I've been to in the MidWest. The ambience was fantastic, clean and no-nonsense. The mixed meat thali had generous portions of chicken and goat which surprised me. For 2 entrees with a tip it cost me about $30, which in my opinion a real good deal."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"On a recent search for a great local indian restaurant we discovered two within a mile of our house...both are great but this one is our new favorite!  Easy to miss from the street, it's worth the search to find.  We have been back twice and service has always been prompt and personable.  The food is equally fantastic!  My husband is a huge fan of their tandori chicken and myself love their mango chicken and chicken tikka masala.  The ""dinner for two"" is a great deal and a fun way to try a few entrees too.  The naan was also great as well as their lentil soup.  We are looking forward to going back!"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,"Probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to taste. To think it's located in the middle of Wisconsin, really sucks because I really dig this place. Anyhow they do serve alcohol here, which helps for most of you reading this review :).  
Let me get the negative out of here, I felt the service was pretty slow, like I had to flag down the waiter. there seemed to be a language barrier, but the other waiters that came around were hard to get a hold of but there was no barrier in communication.....and heck I speak all the langs they speak here lol Go figure! so when I saw communication barrier, I mean it!

Oh and ummm they could spice up the decor lol

Very Important !! They give you the option of picking the level of spice from 1 to 5. We had the food at level 3 and it was perfect to me, I could have gone up to level 4 but I wanted to share the cuisine with my one of my colleagues, he had level 3 for his dishes..... he was sweating profusely but said it was amazing. So if you dare or are tempted try level 4 or 5 :)!!! Lemme know how it goes!

First time ever I had the Dhaba Biryani that had shrimp, chicken, beef , and Lamb.... and the flavors were on point. Usually when you put those all in a combination they tend to clash and not be to appetizing. You won't regret ordering it......unless you can't handle spice :). Still craving it til this day. 

I miss Dhaba already, if you live in the greater Wisconsin area you gota excuse to go to the middle of no where and give this place a shot.

EnjoY the pics and the Videos !"
Dhaba Indian Bistro,chicken tikka masala,Great food for a very good price. Went for lunch and got the tikka masala but wasn't super impressed by it. The food was very fresh however and the naan was great. Lunch came with a salad. Near the heart of Middleton and plenty of parking.
Taste of India,chicken tandoori spinach,"Went for dinner last night.  It had been awhile since I'd ventured over to Taste of India, and I believe the last couple of times I had the lunch buffet.   Dinner was thoroughly great. Their chutneys are fresh (seem to be housemade) and flavorful.  

I had the lamb madras- chunks of lamb in a rich sauce redolent of ginger, curry and coconut.  It was really tasty.  The lamb was a bit tougher than I expected, but still good.  I appreciated the server's suggestion that I order it a notch spicier than usual, as otherwise the sweetness of tamarind overwhelms the other flavors.  We split the spinach naan- very plentiful basket for $2.95.  My boyfriend has a standard order nearly every time we eat Indian food; he loves the Tandoori mixed grill.  Although Taste of India serves theirs with raita, and not masala curry sauce as other establishments in Madison do, he proclaimed theirs the best he's had in Madison.  A steaming mound of tandoori chicken, fish, shrimp, and seekh kabob atop surprisingly flavorful red/green bell peppers and onions- even with a little help from me, we took over half of it home.  At $15.95, that's a steal.  The fish was something one doesn't see nearly enough of on the tandoori mixed grill, and it was a standout.  Well worth the trek from east side to west, right down to clean and festive decor and little touches like silver chutney spoons and antique tureens containing my curry.  mmmm."
Taste of India,chicken tandoori spinach,"I've have enjoyed Indian cuisine for many years. This place is the best. While the buffet here is smaller than most, the quality of food is absolutely second to none. I can't say enough good things about this place. If you like Indian food like I do, you must come eat here. The tandoori chicken is perfect as well as everything they choose to serve you. No way will you be disappointed"
Taste of India,chicken tandoori spinach,"I did the lunch buffet. The food was pretty mediocre. Nothing was bad, necessarily, but nothing was that great, either. The chili chicken was very disappointing - not spicy at all. In fact, nothing was spicy. The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka were so-so. The gulab jamuns were tasty, though. It was nice that this place was open on Christmas, but I'm going to continue my search for a good Indian restaurant in Madison."
Taste of India,chicken tandoori spinach,I like this place quite a bit. The lunch buffet is good and varied with lots of good selections. The tandori chicken and the chai tea and the channa masala are the 3 things we always get. They almost always have a good spinach dish. The naan is usually not that great. Average. Parking is always a little challenging but we usually can find a spot.
Taste of India,chicken tandoori spinach,"My favorite Indian place. Although we eat there often, my husband and I always get the same thing. We share the Vegetarian Platter (mixed appetizers, mmmm) and I get the Paneer Tikka (ahh! the yogurt sauce!), while he has Lamb Pasanda. It's so good we don't want to get anything else. 

Recently, we ordered take out with friends, and we also tried their Chicken Makhani. It was much pinker than other chicken makhani I've had (and made), and tasted a little different. It kind of looked like chicken vindaloo or tandoori chicken, but anyway it was really good. Creamy and flavorful but not too spicy. 

The service at the restaurant is always fantastic, they constantly refill your water glasses and the food comes quickly. No surprise that even though it is off the beaten path, it is almost always crowded. Someday I hope to try their buffet so we can branch out a little..."
Taste of India,chicken tandoori spinach,"Taste of India is a staple in our house.  I can't speak for all dishes because we are too hooked on our favorites, which include the chicken tikka masala, raita, garlic and cheese naan, chicken tandoori appetizer (amazing amount of chicken for an appetizer), and beef vindaloo.  The staff is excellent. The chicken tikka is hands down the best in Madison."
Taste of India,naan,"Ordered for pick-up on a friday night. Pretty standard menu (not exceptionally large but not tiny, either) with typical indian fare. Ordering on grubhub gives you the option of mild, medium or spicy for each entree you add to your basket. One in my party went mild and it wasn't bland or unflavorful - they had dialed everything back without losing the heart of the dish (and a little heat remained to give it a little kick). I requested medium and the heat in mine was definitely amped up. If you want spicy, request spicy. I imagine this goes for sit-down dining as well, although I can't speak to that specifically.

The food was promptly prepared, the host I interacted with was pleasant, professional, and very prompt, and by the time I got home everything was still very warm. Very satisfied. Only major mark is the price: for naan, two entrees, and extra rice we managed to rack up a bill of over 40$. You can find cheaper options elsewhere."
Taste of India,naan,"Taste of Indian has the best naans that I've ever had. I've been to two of their locations and both had the same insanely good naan. My favorite types are the sun dried tomato and the potato. I wasn't too impressed with their buffet, which looked kind of sad. I often get some naan breads to go and make a meal out of them. They're huge, cheap, freshly cooked, and absolutely delicious. Five stars for that!"

Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was very good. Also ordered a side if plain naan which was some of the best I've had. Very fresh and light. 
Overall a good meal, will eat here again to try more of their dishes."
Taste of India,naan,"Went here Friday night. It's a fairly small place, with seating for maybe about 30ish people, and I'd say they were about half full. So, no wait for a table, and we had quick and attentive service. 

We ordered the samosas, goat curry, spinach paneer (both at ""medium"" spiciness), regular naan, and garlic naan (along with a couple of Kingfisher beers). The spinach paneer was really excellent: creamy, thick, and with just the right amount of heat and seasoning. The samosas were pretty standard, though especially good because of how right-out-of-the-fryer crispy they were. The naan was just fine. The goat curry was the only disappointment, with not nearly as much meat as I would have liked/expected, especially at around $13. Next time I might stick to veggie options."
Taste of India,naan,"I honestly can't say what most of the menu is like, because the Chicken Makhani, Lamb Bhartha, and Peshwari Naan are so perfect that the clouds part and little putti sing from on high when I eat them. I really should try something else, but why mess with a good thing? Creamy and probably bad for me, but then why do the putti appear? I love this place."

Taste of India,naan,"Yum. Great Indian food on Monroe st.

My pick up experience was quick and easy. I called in my order outside and my food was ready in about ten minutes. Being somewhat of a rice freak, I asked for an extra portion after I realized they only provided a small togo package of rice. They were nice and gracious enough to provide extra rice at no additional charge.

My roasted eggplant dish was delicious with the right amount of heat. The naan was very soft and tasty. I had enough for dinner and saved leftovers for lunch the next day. I suspect that I might be picking up dinner here more than once, while I am in Madison.

Most definitely a fan!"
Taste of India,chicken tikka masala,"Hands down my favorite chicken tikka masala and mango lassis in Madison. I think their prices or portions could do better, but in terms of flavor, I always pick Taste of India."

Taste of India,chicken tikka masala,"My wife and I were long overdue for a date night.  
We had some coupons to choose from and Kathy decided on Taste of India.
We arrived just before the dinner rush kicked in.
We went with the non-vegetarian dinner for 2:
Rice Pullao and Fresh Onion Chutney, Mint Chutney, 
Tamarind Sauce.
Chicken Pakora, Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Curry, Tandoori Chicken and Nan and Gulab Jamun Dessert.

The food came out in 3 courses:  Chicken Pakora - App, The Entre items, then dessert.

Too much for the 2 of us to finish so we brought the leftovers home to enjoy.

The service was attentive, but not bothersome, and the food was very good.

We will be going back."
Taste of India,chicken tikka masala,"Place was definitely made for white people. I like my Indian food brown people spicy. I recommend avoiding the lunch buffet, it is pretty uninspired and there isn't a huge selection. The chicken tikka is bland but the vindaloo is pretty good"
Taste of India,chicken tikka masala,"This is my wife an my go to Indian joint.  We eat there twice a month.  We love the Veg. and Non-Veg. dinners for two, but be sure to sub out the chicken pakora for the veg. pakora.  My wife and I like spicy Indian, so this place is great for us. They also have a decent AYCE lunch buffet. The only problem is that we usually end up fighting over who gets the last of the Tikka Masla."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"I have never been to this place for the buffet so gave it a shot. It is excellent. Lots of choices including  my favorite lamb curry and lentil soup both very good. Lots of vegetarian dishes as well. The dining room is huge and better looking than most. A little more expensive than some at around eleven dollars I think, but worth it. I just wish the service staff that work here to at least be a little friendly. Even if there is a language barrier it doesn't hurt to make eye contact and SMILE! No one here did. I can live with it and would go back."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"One of my Madison-area friends has been on an Indian food kick ever since I suggested my Milwaukee go-to, Royal India. I'd never had Indian in Madison before, but Yelp has only rarely steered me wrong, so I trusted the judgment of the locals and my friend, my new girlfriend (who was with me on a day-trip to Madtown), and I settled on Maharani, right downtown. 

Indian restaurants seem to either be very formal or extremely casual. I can't speak for the place during their buffet (which, just looking at the size of it as they were cleaning up, looks formidable), but at least during our visit they seemed to err towards the formal side. That was definitely my first impression, so be prepared.

Waitstaff was polite, but distant. No points gained or lost there. Just standard operating procedure.

I ordered the goat curry, served spicy and bone-in. I figured something more basic would give me a gauge to work from if and when I return. I can definitely recommend the dish; it's very flavorful and the goat is tender and despite being covered in a really flavorful sauce, retains a little bit of that rich, slightly gamey flavor that the meat is known for.

My dining partners had the lamb curry (hot, just like mine) and chicken curry (ordered mild), which I sampled. Of the two, I definitely preferred the lamb--although that may have been due to spice level--but the chicken curry would be a good introduction to Indian food.

As I mentioned before, I don't have much to compare Maharani to in terms of Madison's Indian food scene, but I certainly didn't have any major complaints here. I'd love to return for the buffet."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Came here for an IYE! Great time meeting new people!

2014 was the year I became a fan of Indian and Thai curry so when I saw Maharani was on the menu for a IYE, I was all for it. 

Like many have pointed out, wait staff seems to the odd man out. I wouldn't say they were rude but maybe a bit... uninterested?? I am not sure if that is the correct word. Hard to explain. They were very much about getting straight to the business. More like ""hurry up and order"" It was just odd. Some people weigh service more heavily than others. For me, I am very much in the middle unless the staff is just plain rude. Again, the staff wasn't rude but they could work on being more open and inviting to diners. 

Curry and naan was plentiful. So much to choose from. I think I speak for all of those who attended the IYE when I say, it was hard to make an entree choice. There were several curries that peaked my interested. I finally settled on Chicken Vindaloo.

OK. I am extremely picky about chicken. I do not eat dark meat. Only chicken breast. It was my mistake for not asking what part of the chicken is used in their chicken curries. To my discovery, my curry used both dark and white meat. Ehhhhhggg!! I ended up picking out the dark meat. It wasn't that big of a deal but just still sucks. Next time, I will ask questions. The other curry places I frequent uses white meat. I guess I became accustom to this too quickly.

I do prefer Dhaba and Haveli over Maharani. To me, the other two complete the package of what I like about eating curry including atmosphere. I won't rule out ever dining here again however if I am in the area and wanting some curry."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,Sometimes when i go to bed hungry I have dreams about the vegetable curry. It is so good! We've tried many Indian restaurants in Madison and Maharani is the best.
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Lunch buffet was huge and excellent. No lamb dishes when I was there, though, to my disappointment. But I keep having excellent meals there every time I visit Madison."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Maharini is a large menu Indian food restaurant with all the classic vegetarian options. This restaurant is the kind of place that has some vegetarian options under the curries, but then also a vegetarian section, but then also a vegetables section: it's that kind of confusing restaurant. But, my friends and I found the small text that said vegetable dinner for two, and the rest is history.

The dinner came with samosas, palak paneer, mixed vegetable curry, malai kofta, rice, naan, and dessert. It started out with a lentil soup, which was not very good. Imagine buying chicken noodle soup, and instead of getting a broth with chicken and noodles in it, you get kind of a frothy, thicker soup that was the aforementioned soup put through a Ninja blender. That's what the soup was like: no lentils to be seen, a bit thicker, some lentil taste, and not very flavorful. 

The samosas were great. The crispy outside was nicely matched with the soft, potato inside. Out of the main dishes, I'd say only the malai kofta is worth recommending. The malai kofta was very good: the sauce was flavorful, not overwhelming, and it wonderfully seasoned each ball. The palak paneer should be avoided: its texture was quite unpleasant. Google is telling me that the difference between palak paneer and saag paneer is that palak is only spinach. The mixed vegetable curry was fine, but nothing worth writing home about (though, everything is worth telling Yelp about, I guess). I think it's worth noting that the rice was delicious, and I ate too much of it.

The service was okay. The food took a very long time to come out: I believe we waited around 35 minutes, and the restaurant was more than half empty at dinner time on Saturday night.

If I'm ever back in Madison and craving Indian food, I'd return if I couldn't find an alternative!"
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"I had never ever tried Indian cuisine before coming to Maharani a year ago.  I don't know exactly how that happened given that in high school (and to this day) I was obsessed with Red Dwarf, and if chicken vindaloo was good enough for Dave Lister it sure as hell was good enough for me.  Yet throughout all of my years in college I never had the chance to have a proper curry.  Part of the reason had to be at that time there were no Indian restaurants downtown to my knowledge.  I knew about the ones on Odana but I never drove out that way, so they just remained on the long list of places to go someday.  I also spent a good deal of my later college years frequenting mostly Thai restaurants whenever I had enough scratch to get a proper meal.  So it somehow came to be that I entered my late twenties knowing only that I loved Thai curry, with a huge question mark relating to Indian food.

Fortunately I've got a good group of friends that would not let this aberration stand.  One rainy spring night last year we were all arguing about our respective favorites in town, and I let it be known that I'd never tried anything Indian save a curry-flavored ramen one unfortunate time.  We went to Maharani because it was their agreed upon favorite.  I can now say that it is also mine.  It was one of those times when you experience something that in retrospect you don't know how you ever got by without.  I liked everything about Maharani.  My chicken shahikorma, medium spice, was the perfect starting point.  On return trips, and there have been many, I've fallen in love with the chicken shahjahani, the lamb jalfrazie, and the paneer - Oh boy do I like the paneer.  Yet writing this review I realize the one thing that I've not done is the chicken vindaloo.  Next time, for sure.

I'm not usually downtown around lunch, so I've never tried the buffet.  It sounds interesting, but I've been told that the Odana restaurants are superior in this regard.  I can't say one way or another.  I would easily give Maharani five stars except for one drawback: the service can be frustratingly slow.  Sometimes it's exceptional, but more than a few times I've sat at the table, papadams long gone, spooning nibbles of the onion relish, with an empty bottle of Kingfisher, just waiting to order.  I like the place too much to ever stop going, but that kind of thing drives me crazy.  Still, even with the occassional wait I put Maharani at the top of my list of Madison favorites."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Was in Madison for a wedding and was staying at the Hyatt downtown which was across from this restaurant. Reviews were good so decided to try out the lunch buffet and I was not disappointed. They had a bigger than normal selection of items and most importantly it was all fresh. A lot of times indian buffets have food that feels like it is a day or two old but this place each and every item was fresh. The goat curry was da bomb, the meat was tender and the curry had the perfect zing to it. The tandoori chicken was extremely good and fresh and so was the chicken tawa tikka. They even had one indo-chinese item, i.e. chicken manchurian which most indian restaurants screw up really badly but this one was by far one of the best I've had (probably second only to the restaurants on Oak Tree in Edison, NJ). 

 I focused my attention on the non-veg but my wife is veg and she said the veg items were pretty good too. The paneer makhni was the only item she said wasn't all that. 

What else, hmm ... they have outdoor seating which is nice and the decor indoor is nice too. Oh yes, they have a good selection of Indian beers as well as Indian wines (which is rare)."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Recent dinner experience at the Maharani was somewhat disappointing, It was crowded, but no excuse for the barely courteous service, dishes ordered not being delivered, etc. My mixed vegetable curry was hot, but lacked the subtle mix of spices that goes into good Indian cuisine. The vegetables were overcooked,lacked flavor. My dining companion was similarly underwhelmed by his lamb dish. Perhaps best to stick with the lunch buffet here. If they continue to offer dinner, they should ramp up the quality of the cooking and the service."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Delicious food! We came here for dinner in a Saturday. Panneer was tasty and had a great texture, naan was perfectly cooked. Lamb was tender. Looking forward to the lunch buffet."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"As a visitor to Madison, I was expecting little more than the usual beef potatoes and other carbohydrates that I would normally expect from the late night Wisconsin fare. 

This restaurant was devastatingly good. Not only did they deliver straight to my airbnb, but the food was so satisfying and hearty that I had leftovers for the following day. It was equally, if not even more, delicious.

I ordered a side of rice, a saag specialty item, and the chef's naan. The naan was a meal unto itself. The rice was perfectly done and the curry had the perfect amount of spice. It is also worth noting that this restaurant is very generous with its side-portions.

Say yes to this choice, vegetarian or not."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"I keep realizing that it's really unfair for me to expect amazing ethnic food in Madison--it's especially unfair to compare it to what I can get in NY. Of course, that won't stop me from doing it, so here goes...

Maharani is solid. Their lunch buffet is solid. The food is good, but certainly nothing special...and at $12 for the lunch buffet, it's also overpriced. Whenever yo make food en masse for a lunch buffet, stuff is bound to get dry--that's how I felt with some of the food they had out. 

On the plus side: Good rice pudding (apparently I'm the only one who eats it), good goat curry, nice (but basic) chicken tikka, good baji, and decent paneer. 

Minus side: Fish was dry, we weren't given enough naan (I attribute this to the service), and the lamb they had was way, way overcooked.

So, would I go back? Probably, especially since it's a group favorite of ours--we only go for lunch, though, and every few months at that. Three stars seems appropriate--it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, and it's certainly incomparable to what I can get on Curry Row (6th Street) or Curry (Murray) Hill."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"They get points for having an insane line-up of naan, perhaps 10 if my memory serves me, and my vegetable curry was really rocking, but the place loses major points for it's staff. Inattentive, unkind, and almost abrasive at times. I'm not sure if it was an off night, because few other reviews mention this point, but it really soured my evening. I'll likely head back to try their lunch buffet, where services simply isn't as important, but I find that there's a wealth of Indian restaurants in town, and if I'm doing dinner at one of them, it likely won't be Maharani."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,My boyfriend and I carry-out their vegetable mixed curry at least once a week. A wonderful atmosphere for eating in as well. I'd also recommend the vegetable pakora!
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"This place was very authentic. When you walk in and see the fennel seeds and smell the curry in the air, you know you're in for some savory goodness. I had the Aloo Chole and shared a Mixed Grill. Everything was flavorful and well made. Would definitely go back for the Tandoori Chicken."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Been back.  They had some kind of lamb dish on the buffet.  I love lamb so I fished the meat out and just ate that, the onion chutney (it's a nice moderate spice level), naan, and rice.  I think I put away about 2 lbs of lamb.  So for 9 dollars - that's not a bad deal.  

Only problem - you can't predict when they'll have the lamb and when they won't.  

bah"
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"I used to like it a lot more and frequented Maharani while I live downtown. I love their Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Grilled Fish, and various forms of curries, especially the lamb and beef. Their naan and house made mango ice-cream top my list of favorites too. 

However, on one occasion after a meal I felt super thirsty throughout the entire afternoon, and had to keep drinking water non-stop. Not the greatest feeling after a buffet. Since then I haven't been back for a while.

Recently my lab had a craving for Indian buffet and they talked me into giving it another try. The food was good, but the feeling of addiction in the past didn't kick in. There are many others in the community, my friends included, who love Maharani. Personally I don't see myself going back in a (long) while. I know this is not going to be particularly helpful but I would suggest people to go once and decide for yourself if this is for you. And it will help too to go with an open mind and try the wide spread of food they have on offer. And if you do go I will be happy to hear any thoughts =)"
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,Their chicken Tikka Masala and the lamb byriani were very good and so were the portions.
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"I've only had takeout. No major complaints. I would order for a reliable hot meal, but so far nothing has blown my mind.

The lamb curry was kind of spicy but besides that not as flavorful as I would prefer. Supposedly comes with yogurt but if it's in the sauce I couldn't tell. Next time will ask for it as a side as well. Generous with the lamb; lots of big, delicious pieces in my dish! Would've liked some more veggies or something to break up the broth in addition to the meat.

Chicken 65 was pretty good and the naan was great but I've never seen a restaurant mess up naan.

Gotta go back for the buffet. It's kind of expensive to do takeout from here so that should be a more affordable way to sample the menu."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Three of us showed up at 7:15 PM on Labor Day  (National holiday). We were seated at a booth in what was probably the waiting area; not great, but we were happy to find a place that was open. We ordered 3 entrees (a lamb, a chicken & an eggplant) and some naan  (bread) to share. It took longer than I thought it would. Our food was finally delivered and the first thing we noticed is that they all looked alike and the portions seemed small. The entrees were tasty, but not distinctive. The service was only OK. But again, they get extra points for being open."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"This is really a 3 and a half! I went for the lunch buffet, and I'd say half the dishes were great and half were pretty low quality. Some tasty things worth noting were the Green Beans Poriyal which were incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly and a cauliflower dish I forget the name of. I wouldn't recommend the Dahi Vada (those donut-looking things) unless they're freshly out on the table, cuz they get so soggy so quickly! The paneer dish I had was good, the tikka masala was nice, but the fried fish dish was pretty blah- not fresh, and there's nothing worse than not-fresh fish! Dessert was yummy but the staple Indian buffet mango ice cream just tasted like vanilla grocery store ice cream flavored lightly with mango. Tip-if you're going anywhere important later, be careful, because you'll walk around smelling strongly of delicious curry for the rest of the day! You decide if that's a good or bad thing."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Got chicken and mushroom curry, and two stuffed breads. I'm pretty good with spicy food, raised on schezuan food, but a little surprised by the medium heat on the curry, more like full vindaloo at most Indian places I've had. Still tasty, chicken very tender, all dark meat I believe, which is unusual, but I liked it and definitely not dry. Reason not five stars was the naan was a little soggy and barely had any chicken or veggies in them. I wasn't excpecting a calzone, but usuall stuffed naan a little more generous. Service was good, very nice lady. Will order from again next time I'm in town."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"The biggest mistake I've made this week is leaving my leftover curry at the table. This place is absolutely delicious, and I plan on coming back as soon as possible.

I came here with a lovely group of people for dinner. I made a mental note that this restaurant offered a lunch buffet so I plan on revisiting for this aspect. The restaurant has a calm, Indian decor with an explosion of amazing smells and spices. It's also pretty spacy, so you won't find yourself bumping elbows or weaving around people.

Menu is huge, and it contains everything from lamb to chicken and veggies to dessert. I  ordered the chicken jalfrezie with a side of plain naan. Absolutely heavenly; how did they achieve such a creamy texture without dairy?! I'll never know. Hours later, my stomach is still happy. Chicken was moist, and the naan was fluffy and crunchy. Everything about my dinner experience here was lovely.

Our waters were refilled constantly, which is always a huge plus when eating spicy foods. The restaurant wasn't too busy, so my experience here was pretty positive overall. I love Indian food, and Madison has proven that this city can make some great curry. Yes, yum, yay!"
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,"Avoid the chicken pakora - it tastes like half-assed, microwaved Indian chicken fingers. And unless you're a huge fan of spinach, I would advise that you steer away from the spinach dishes. While I recognize that they would be good to a spinach lover, the flavor (or lack thereof) of the spinach tends to overwhelm everything else in the dish. Also, though my girlfriend swears by the dosa, I find it to be a little bland.

Oh well, turns out there are some occasional bad dishes here. Still, everything else is awesome.

I highly recommend the lamb or beef shahi korma. Definitely one of the best things I ever ate. It's steeped in this delectable orange (the color, not the flavor) cream sauce which contains ground-up cashews that are both impossible to distinguish from the sauce, and impossible to not notice in the taste. And who ever thought that raisins match so well with red meat? 

The chef's special naan is also god damn amazing. Dip it in everything."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb curry,Can't speak to the actual restaurant or service because I get it delivered. the food is excellent vindalo currie is my favorite had it with chicken shrimp & lamb I love spicy ask for it extra spicy and they do try some of the different naan bread like the garlic the best only one in my house that likes Indian food although the kids will eat the chicken pakora generally good delivery did have 1 time were it took awhile and I had to call ended up taking almost 2 hours
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"We LOVED this place! We had the tandoori chicken, tandoori mixed grill and naan. Everything was so flavorful we wanted to keep eating even though the portions are so big you shouldn't clean your plate. We went at dinner on a Wednesday night, so it was pretty empty, but the service was excellent. Maharani just became one of our favorites in Madison!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Do I really have to give them a whole star?  My husband says yes, and that at least the food wasn't moldy.   Lacking was this restaurant's calling card for a one time visit.  The food was solidly mediocre.  The decor was pedestrian.  But the service, oh the service, earned a tails-up penny.  Awful, just awful.  Our Server failed to address an empty soda glass, did not offer additional Naan, and reopened the blinds after we shut them to block the bright sun.  We did not find chewed gum or stones in our food, so at least we can't complain that they were actively trying to kill us.  All that being said, the mold would have added more character."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"It is my second time ordering from Maharani. It is also only my second time eating Indian food. I may not know anything about authentic Indian food, but I do know when food tastes good.  I've never eaten at the actual restaurant, so my review is based solely on the food. The two times I've ordered take-out from here I have gotten the Butter Chicken, medium spice, and the Keema Naan. The keema naan is just naan ""bread"" stuffed with lamb meat. The medium spice on the butter chicken is spicier than ""medium."" However, I really enjoy it! The white rice that the dish comes with helps tame the spiciness. I do find myself taking some breaks in between bites. If you aren't someone that regularly eats spicy food I would recommend mild spice. This dish also contains peanuts, so beware to those that can't consume nuts! I enjoy ordering the naan with this entree because it works like a sponge to soak up all the sauce from the butter chicken and it is like a palate cleanser. Tonight was just one of those nights that I was craving some flavorful, filling take out. I received my order promptly and it satisfied my craving to a T. I'm a happy gal! Thank you Maharani!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Came here for an IYE! Great time meeting new people!

2014 was the year I became a fan of Indian and Thai curry so when I saw Maharani was on the menu for a IYE, I was all for it. 

Like many have pointed out, wait staff seems to the odd man out. I wouldn't say they were rude but maybe a bit... uninterested?? I am not sure if that is the correct word. Hard to explain. They were very much about getting straight to the business. More like ""hurry up and order"" It was just odd. Some people weigh service more heavily than others. For me, I am very much in the middle unless the staff is just plain rude. Again, the staff wasn't rude but they could work on being more open and inviting to diners. 

Curry and naan was plentiful. So much to choose from. I think I speak for all of those who attended the IYE when I say, it was hard to make an entree choice. There were several curries that peaked my interested. I finally settled on Chicken Vindaloo.

OK. I am extremely picky about chicken. I do not eat dark meat. Only chicken breast. It was my mistake for not asking what part of the chicken is used in their chicken curries. To my discovery, my curry used both dark and white meat. Ehhhhhggg!! I ended up picking out the dark meat. It wasn't that big of a deal but just still sucks. Next time, I will ask questions. The other curry places I frequent uses white meat. I guess I became accustom to this too quickly.

I do prefer Dhaba and Haveli over Maharani. To me, the other two complete the package of what I like about eating curry including atmosphere. I won't rule out ever dining here again however if I am in the area and wanting some curry."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Amazing indian lunch buffet with really good indian food. All tables will get a basket of naan, there is also a desert bar with good mango ice cream.
Things I ate at the buffet:
·Briyani rice with chicken: delicious! Easily my favorite dish in the whole buffet. It wasn't too spicy either and the chicken in it was mostly red meat, yum.
·Samosa: big and delicious... It's stuffed with potatoes and was so good.
·Saag (creamy spinach): good
·Paneer: not bad. 
·Chicken tikka masala: this was a disappointment. This is one of the staples I always eat at all indian restaurants. I felt like I was eating defrosted pieces of dry Tyson chicken breast that had been cooked in the sauce. It almost tasted too healthy.
Overall, delicious and cheap food in unlimited quantities. Great deal especially for UW students!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"The food is really great. I can't tell you whether it is authentic, but it doesn't scream fake Americanized indian food. It also doesn't scream obsessively authentic is a way that will be distracting. It is that happy medium - somewhere between exotic and comforting.

Warm, creamy, rich, curries to die for on a winter day (so, six months per year).

The naan is awesome.

The mango lassis...mmm."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"The thing I like about Indian buffets, typically, is that I have to stop eating when I get full, not when I simply get tired of the food.  Unfortunately, I stopped eating the lunch buffet here because it simply didn't really seem to be worth the trouble.  It wasn't exactly bad, it was just not that tasty.  Well, there was a spicy carrot dish that was so overspiced it was inedible.  The naan. for which I had to get up, go across the room to the waiter who was folding napkins, and ask for, was just OK."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! I eat here about once a month. The chicken tikka masala is my go to dish. I also love their lamb shahi korma. All of their naan is delicious, they have lots of choices. I usually go for the cheese stuffed naan. If you order delivery expect about an hour wait. Dinner service is always consistent & very timely. I've never had to wait long to be seated. Be sure to finish your meal with a mango lassi. If you're craving Indian food, this is your place!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"One of my favorite lunches in madison! Great variety of Indian food for all you can eat buffet lunch. Nobody judges me for eating several heaping plates of garlic naan and tandoori chicken, and I like that. Trust me, you will leave full and happily sleepy 100% of the time."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"In previous years, I've had better experience with Maharani. This time we went for Saturday lunch buffet, and I have to say I was disappointed. The food was okay, though the Chicken Tikka Masala had very dry and chewy chicken. The staff was friendly but inattentive at the same time. I had to ask three times for more naan, and by the time we got some more (~20 minutes, and the restaurant was only half-full), my dish was completely cold.
My biggest concern was, however, that they stop refilling dish pans around 1:30pm - despite the fact that they are open until 3pm for lunch. I understand that they don't want too much leftovers, but then remove the empty pans and the name of the dish so the customer doesn't feel like  she's been cheated. It's really disheartening to walk up to the dessert rack only to find that out of originally eight options you have only two left to choose from."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,Best Indian in Madison so far and I have tried 4. Why? They have more selection and it's delicious. You get a basket of fresh toasted buttery naan and get more if you ask.
Maharani Restaurant,naan,Great tikka masala.  Garlic naan wasn't bad.  I was happy/satisfied!
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"I am a small, white girl, but I'd like to think I know my Indian food. Indian is my favorite type of food and I've eaten a fair share (homemade and in restaurants). And I have to say, Maharani made my tummy very happy. 

Atmosphere - nothing fancy. They could improve on it, but it is clean, spacious, comfortable.

Food - Delicious! I had samosa chaat, which was fabulous! It was the prefect combination of cool, spicy, crunchy and creamy. I had the garlic naan and the Malai Kofta, which was delicious as well. The veggie dumplings were good, had a nice consistency and the gravy was very flavorful. 

Service - Wonderful. They were attentive without being pushy. They were very kind and attentive even though we stayed long after we were finished.

Now I just need to go back to try a dosa!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Delicious food! We came here for dinner in a Saturday. Panneer was tasty and had a great texture, naan was perfectly cooked. Lamb was tender. Looking forward to the lunch buffet."

Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Maharani is always at the top of our to-eat list: the food, the service, the location, the FOOD! all make this a really top-notch Indian restaurant.  I know that the dinner menu is great, but we hardly ever make it here for dinner, just because the lunch buffet is so impressive and reasonably-priced (there's a student discount, too). The naan is baked fresh and brought right to your table, the chutneys and sauces complement the food nicely, the samosas are perfectly dense and crispy, and the spices in the main dishes are just right (even though I could probably take it a little spicier).  And the waiters are always so attentive--Preet is especially wonderful! I love Maharani!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Once you get over the fact that you seem to be the only person talking in the restaurant because it's such an expansive place, you get lost in the large, delicious portions and steamy, buttery naan. The place doesn't look fancy enough for the prices on the dinner menu (about $13-16), but the food is good enough to avoid regret. 

If you don't want anything specific, the buffet is well worth it- all of the dishes always look steaming hot and fresh and there are at least 20+ different items (plus dessert) to choose from...all for only $8.95.

in fact, i wish i was there right now."

Maharani Restaurant,naan,"The lunch buffet is awesome! You can get mild, American-friendly dishes like chicken tikka masala and more authentic fares, such as goat meat. The buffet alOfws you to try tastes of everything, and go back and get more of what you love. 

The naan is delicious and the tikka masala is the perfect thing for a cold day. I know it's not something that is typically done, but one of my favorite things to eat at Maharani is a few of the gulab jamun with some mango ice cream in the same dish. Lovely combination of textures, and hot and cold. So tasty, and the perfect way to end a meal!

I would probably visit just for the smells!

Service is good, water glasses are constantly filled and plates are cleared quickly."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"This was my first time here.
We went with friends for the lunch Buffet and it was pretty delicious. The price wasn't too bad with how much food there was.
I really liked the ""buttered chicken"" which I had 2 helpings of. And the naan was great. 
Also the tandoori chicken was very moist and a great  selection of other Indian dishes that I don't know how to pronounce. 

It was nice to see that it was wheelchair accessible. 
The only small complaint that I had was that they didn't come around and refill our drinks and they completely forgot one of soda's. 
It was a little difficult to get someone's attention, but nothing that would keep me from going back. 

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good Indian Buffet  for s great price"

It's on the same block as the Metropolitan Condominiums so parking can be a little tricky. However, the food is worth it. The selection was vast and everything was delicious. Salads, entrees, deserts, and they brought fresh naan to our table. The only thing that was less than perfect was when trying to pay our bill at the end of our meal. The hostess rang up the previous patron and then disappeared for almost 10 minutes. Otherwise this place was outstanding. We will definitely go back!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"I crave Indian food pretty regularly and I'm happy to know that there are a number of Indian restaurants in Madison to satisfy my craving.

The samosa, vegetable pakora, paneer (cheese) pakora are decent.  However, the Aloo Tikki (small spicy potato discs) is very tasty with the right amount of spices.

I LOVE Parantha (layered whole wheat bread made with melted butter) and the Maharani Parantha here are delicious and remind me of when I used to make these with mom.  You have to eat them right when they come out though because that's when they're the best - hot, buttery, crispy and tender.  

The Roti Naan is pretty good too.  Made exactly the way naan is (baked in a tandoor oven) except they use whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  

The Chicken Tikka Masala is delectable.  The sauce is orange colored, rich, creamy and has nice chunks of boneless chicken (could use more chunks of chicken).  This is also spiced really nicely.  You get a choice of mild, medium or hot for the level of spiciness in your dishes.  Medium here is really good - it teeters on medium and hot.

The Palak Paneer (spinach cooked with homemade cheese) is earthy, spicy and buttery.  This is really, really good.  The only thing about the dish is that the ginger pieces were a little overwhelming.

Dessert
Gulab Jamun (it's like a deep fried dounut hole soaked in sugar syrup) has been my favorite Indian dessert since childhood.  Not a lot of places know how to make this dessert right.  It has to be lite and airy not dense and hard.  Maharani makes it just right and hot off of the stove!  It's delicious!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"The best Indian food in Madison! Really fast and friendly service whether you eat in for dinner or lunch buffet or get take out. In a perfect world, I would have their fluffy buttery naan with every meal every day of my life."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"We eat here at least once a week. The food never disappoints and the service is great! Prior to moving to Madison I had never had Indian food and was nervous to try it but upon trying the food here - I can't get enough of it! I highly suggest this place (: I'm a fairly picky eater but my favorite is the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and spring rolls!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,Fantastic selection and  value for lunch buffet.  Service was prompt and friendly at a recent visit.  The naan was hot and delicious--our basket was never empty.  The restaurant is elegant and clean--with one exception.  One important suggestion to management:  PLEASE clean the blinds and window wells--really a health hazard with over half an inch of dust on slats and dust and debris below windows--right next to booths--gross. It was evident these windows and blinds have not been cleaned in at least a year.
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"I love this place - it's my go to for downtown Indian take out, delivery, or buffet. Their spicy is actually spicy. Garlic naan is out of this world."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"I came here on a Tuesday night with a colleague from work (who is Indian) as we were attending a conference.  The Hilton front desk referred us to come here for Indian.

The place had maybe 3-4 other tables with people so it was pretty empty.  When we asked for suggestions, neither the male or female waiters had any suggestions at all.  The waiters seemed disinterested and didn't smile.  They seemed unhappy working there and couldn't care less about the customers.  In conclusion, the service was awful.  

The food was mediocre.  I've had much better Indian food at most other Indian restauarants, but I thought it was okay.  We had the chicken tikki masala and chicken vindaloo.  The mango lassi was soso.  The garlic naan was good.  My colleague said none of the food was authentic or tasted good.  He even told the waiter this at the end of the meal (the waiter didn't seem to care).

As a side note, the waiter made a mistake serving the wrong dish to another table as well as messed up another table's check.  One patron actually started yelling at him in from of the entire restaurant about how poor the service was and the restaurant staff didn't seem to care at all.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  There are better Indian restaurants in town."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Oh god...chicken tikka....NOM NOM NOM.
Their buffet is sooo good. The naan is warm and buttery. All of the dishes are hot and delicious. I recommend the chicken tikka, butter chicken, chicken 65, garlic grilled chicken, and tandoori chicken."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Got chicken and mushroom curry, and two stuffed breads. I'm pretty good with spicy food, raised on schezuan food, but a little surprised by the medium heat on the curry, more like full vindaloo at most Indian places I've had. Still tasty, chicken very tender, all dark meat I believe, which is unusual, but I liked it and definitely not dry. Reason not five stars was the naan was a little soggy and barely had any chicken or veggies in them. I wasn't excpecting a calzone, but usuall stuffed naan a little more generous. Service was good, very nice lady. Will order from again next time I'm in town."
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"I've eaten at Maharani both for their lunch buffet and for dinner.

When it comes to their lunch buffet where Maharani truly excels is selection. They have the widest selection available in the Madison area which allows you to try more things -- half the point of a lunch buffet, in my opinion.

The lunch buffet has had consistently good quality food for the several times I've been there. They also do have some spicy dishes for those who are concerned about the lack of authenticity in the heat at most Indian buffets and fortunately by having more dishes available they keep service accessible to most people.

Lunch can get very crowded and that can impact water and naan basket refills.

Similarly dinner is great but can get expensive (especially if you are a naan fiend). The caliber of service increases dramatically when the lunch rush isn't on and our waiter was very attentive and helpful.

If you are looking to try as many new things as you can for lunch this is a great place to go!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"The biggest mistake I've made this week is leaving my leftover curry at the table. This place is absolutely delicious, and I plan on coming back as soon as possible.

I came here with a lovely group of people for dinner. I made a mental note that this restaurant offered a lunch buffet so I plan on revisiting for this aspect. The restaurant has a calm, Indian decor with an explosion of amazing smells and spices. It's also pretty spacy, so you won't find yourself bumping elbows or weaving around people.

Menu is huge, and it contains everything from lamb to chicken and veggies to dessert. I  ordered the chicken jalfrezie with a side of plain naan. Absolutely heavenly; how did they achieve such a creamy texture without dairy?! I'll never know. Hours later, my stomach is still happy. Chicken was moist, and the naan was fluffy and crunchy. Everything about my dinner experience here was lovely.

Our waters were refilled constantly, which is always a huge plus when eating spicy foods. The restaurant wasn't too busy, so my experience here was pretty positive overall. I love Indian food, and Madison has proven that this city can make some great curry. Yes, yum, yay!"
Maharani Restaurant,naan,"Avoid the chicken pakora - it tastes like half-assed, microwaved Indian chicken fingers. And unless you're a huge fan of spinach, I would advise that you steer away from the spinach dishes. While I recognize that they would be good to a spinach lover, the flavor (or lack thereof) of the spinach tends to overwhelm everything else in the dish. Also, though my girlfriend swears by the dosa, I find it to be a little bland.

Oh well, turns out there are some occasional bad dishes here. Still, everything else is awesome.

I highly recommend the lamb or beef shahi korma. Definitely one of the best things I ever ate. It's steeped in this delectable orange (the color, not the flavor) cream sauce which contains ground-up cashews that are both impossible to distinguish from the sauce, and impossible to not notice in the taste. And who ever thought that raisins match so well with red meat? 

The chef's special naan is also god damn amazing. Dip it in everything."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"One of my Madison-area friends has been on an Indian food kick ever since I suggested my Milwaukee go-to, Royal India. I'd never had Indian in Madison before, but Yelp has only rarely steered me wrong, so I trusted the judgment of the locals and my friend, my new girlfriend (who was with me on a day-trip to Madtown), and I settled on Maharani, right downtown. 

Indian restaurants seem to either be very formal or extremely casual. I can't speak for the place during their buffet (which, just looking at the size of it as they were cleaning up, looks formidable), but at least during our visit they seemed to err towards the formal side. That was definitely my first impression, so be prepared.

Waitstaff was polite, but distant. No points gained or lost there. Just standard operating procedure.

I ordered the goat curry, served spicy and bone-in. I figured something more basic would give me a gauge to work from if and when I return. I can definitely recommend the dish; it's very flavorful and the goat is tender and despite being covered in a really flavorful sauce, retains a little bit of that rich, slightly gamey flavor that the meat is known for.

My dining partners had the lamb curry (hot, just like mine) and chicken curry (ordered mild), which I sampled. Of the two, I definitely preferred the lamb--although that may have been due to spice level--but the chicken curry would be a good introduction to Indian food.

As I mentioned before, I don't have much to compare Maharani to in terms of Madison's Indian food scene, but I certainly didn't have any major complaints here. I'd love to return for the buffet."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Came here for an IYE! Great time meeting new people!

2014 was the year I became a fan of Indian and Thai curry so when I saw Maharani was on the menu for a IYE, I was all for it. 

Like many have pointed out, wait staff seems to the odd man out. I wouldn't say they were rude but maybe a bit... uninterested?? I am not sure if that is the correct word. Hard to explain. They were very much about getting straight to the business. More like ""hurry up and order"" It was just odd. Some people weigh service more heavily than others. For me, I am very much in the middle unless the staff is just plain rude. Again, the staff wasn't rude but they could work on being more open and inviting to diners. 

Curry and naan was plentiful. So much to choose from. I think I speak for all of those who attended the IYE when I say, it was hard to make an entree choice. There were several curries that peaked my interested. I finally settled on Chicken Vindaloo.

OK. I am extremely picky about chicken. I do not eat dark meat. Only chicken breast. It was my mistake for not asking what part of the chicken is used in their chicken curries. To my discovery, my curry used both dark and white meat. Ehhhhhggg!! I ended up picking out the dark meat. It wasn't that big of a deal but just still sucks. Next time, I will ask questions. The other curry places I frequent uses white meat. I guess I became accustom to this too quickly.

I do prefer Dhaba and Haveli over Maharani. To me, the other two complete the package of what I like about eating curry including atmosphere. I won't rule out ever dining here again however if I am in the area and wanting some curry."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,Sometimes when i go to bed hungry I have dreams about the vegetable curry. It is so good! We've tried many Indian restaurants in Madison and Maharani is the best.
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Lunch buffet was huge and excellent. No lamb dishes when I was there, though, to my disappointment. But I keep having excellent meals there every time I visit Madison."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Maharini is a large menu Indian food restaurant with all the classic vegetarian options. This restaurant is the kind of place that has some vegetarian options under the curries, but then also a vegetarian section, but then also a vegetables section: it's that kind of confusing restaurant. But, my friends and I found the small text that said vegetable dinner for two, and the rest is history.

The dinner came with samosas, palak paneer, mixed vegetable curry, malai kofta, rice, naan, and dessert. It started out with a lentil soup, which was not very good. Imagine buying chicken noodle soup, and instead of getting a broth with chicken and noodles in it, you get kind of a frothy, thicker soup that was the aforementioned soup put through a Ninja blender. That's what the soup was like: no lentils to be seen, a bit thicker, some lentil taste, and not very flavorful. 

The samosas were great. The crispy outside was nicely matched with the soft, potato inside. Out of the main dishes, I'd say only the malai kofta is worth recommending. The malai kofta was very good: the sauce was flavorful, not overwhelming, and it wonderfully seasoned each ball. The palak paneer should be avoided: its texture was quite unpleasant. Google is telling me that the difference between palak paneer and saag paneer is that palak is only spinach. The mixed vegetable curry was fine, but nothing worth writing home about (though, everything is worth telling Yelp about, I guess). I think it's worth noting that the rice was delicious, and I ate too much of it.

The service was okay. The food took a very long time to come out: I believe we waited around 35 minutes, and the restaurant was more than half empty at dinner time on Saturday night.

If I'm ever back in Madison and craving Indian food, I'd return if I couldn't find an alternative!"
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"I had never ever tried Indian cuisine before coming to Maharani a year ago.  I don't know exactly how that happened given that in high school (and to this day) I was obsessed with Red Dwarf, and if chicken vindaloo was good enough for Dave Lister it sure as hell was good enough for me.  Yet throughout all of my years in college I never had the chance to have a proper curry.  Part of the reason had to be at that time there were no Indian restaurants downtown to my knowledge.  I knew about the ones on Odana but I never drove out that way, so they just remained on the long list of places to go someday.  I also spent a good deal of my later college years frequenting mostly Thai restaurants whenever I had enough scratch to get a proper meal.  So it somehow came to be that I entered my late twenties knowing only that I loved Thai curry, with a huge question mark relating to Indian food.

Fortunately I've got a good group of friends that would not let this aberration stand.  One rainy spring night last year we were all arguing about our respective favorites in town, and I let it be known that I'd never tried anything Indian save a curry-flavored ramen one unfortunate time.  We went to Maharani because it was their agreed upon favorite.  I can now say that it is also mine.  It was one of those times when you experience something that in retrospect you don't know how you ever got by without.  I liked everything about Maharani.  My chicken shahikorma, medium spice, was the perfect starting point.  On return trips, and there have been many, I've fallen in love with the chicken shahjahani, the lamb jalfrazie, and the paneer - Oh boy do I like the paneer.  Yet writing this review I realize the one thing that I've not done is the chicken vindaloo.  Next time, for sure.

I'm not usually downtown around lunch, so I've never tried the buffet.  It sounds interesting, but I've been told that the Odana restaurants are superior in this regard.  I can't say one way or another.  I would easily give Maharani five stars except for one drawback: the service can be frustratingly slow.  Sometimes it's exceptional, but more than a few times I've sat at the table, papadams long gone, spooning nibbles of the onion relish, with an empty bottle of Kingfisher, just waiting to order.  I like the place too much to ever stop going, but that kind of thing drives me crazy.  Still, even with the occassional wait I put Maharani at the top of my list of Madison favorites."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Was in Madison for a wedding and was staying at the Hyatt downtown which was across from this restaurant. Reviews were good so decided to try out the lunch buffet and I was not disappointed. They had a bigger than normal selection of items and most importantly it was all fresh. A lot of times indian buffets have food that feels like it is a day or two old but this place each and every item was fresh. The goat curry was da bomb, the meat was tender and the curry had the perfect zing to it. The tandoori chicken was extremely good and fresh and so was the chicken tawa tikka. They even had one indo-chinese item, i.e. chicken manchurian which most indian restaurants screw up really badly but this one was by far one of the best I've had (probably second only to the restaurants on Oak Tree in Edison, NJ). 

 I focused my attention on the non-veg but my wife is veg and she said the veg items were pretty good too. The paneer makhni was the only item she said wasn't all that. 

What else, hmm ... they have outdoor seating which is nice and the decor indoor is nice too. Oh yes, they have a good selection of Indian beers as well as Indian wines (which is rare)."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Recent dinner experience at the Maharani was somewhat disappointing, It was crowded, but no excuse for the barely courteous service, dishes ordered not being delivered, etc. My mixed vegetable curry was hot, but lacked the subtle mix of spices that goes into good Indian cuisine. The vegetables were overcooked,lacked flavor. My dining companion was similarly underwhelmed by his lamb dish. Perhaps best to stick with the lunch buffet here. If they continue to offer dinner, they should ramp up the quality of the cooking and the service."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Delicious food! We came here for dinner in a Saturday. Panneer was tasty and had a great texture, naan was perfectly cooked. Lamb was tender. Looking forward to the lunch buffet."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"As a visitor to Madison, I was expecting little more than the usual beef potatoes and other carbohydrates that I would normally expect from the late night Wisconsin fare. 

This restaurant was devastatingly good. Not only did they deliver straight to my airbnb, but the food was so satisfying and hearty that I had leftovers for the following day. It was equally, if not even more, delicious.

I ordered a side of rice, a saag specialty item, and the chef's naan. The naan was a meal unto itself. The rice was perfectly done and the curry had the perfect amount of spice. It is also worth noting that this restaurant is very generous with its side-portions.

Say yes to this choice, vegetarian or not."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"I've only ever had takeout from this restaurant, but so far I've been seriously impressed with the quality of the product. We've ordered the lamb vindaloo and the chicken tikka masala on both occasions, and I have been blown away by the flavor, consistency of the sauces, and high quality rice. I am anxious to go back to visit in the restaurant to see if the service in-house matches up to the takeaway experience. It is evidently a family run business and you can taste the difference in the recipes."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"I keep realizing that it's really unfair for me to expect amazing ethnic food in Madison--it's especially unfair to compare it to what I can get in NY. Of course, that won't stop me from doing it, so here goes...

Maharani is solid. Their lunch buffet is solid. The food is good, but certainly nothing special...and at $12 for the lunch buffet, it's also overpriced. Whenever yo make food en masse for a lunch buffet, stuff is bound to get dry--that's how I felt with some of the food they had out. 

On the plus side: Good rice pudding (apparently I'm the only one who eats it), good goat curry, nice (but basic) chicken tikka, good baji, and decent paneer. 

Minus side: Fish was dry, we weren't given enough naan (I attribute this to the service), and the lamb they had was way, way overcooked.

So, would I go back? Probably, especially since it's a group favorite of ours--we only go for lunch, though, and every few months at that. Three stars seems appropriate--it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, and it's certainly incomparable to what I can get on Curry Row (6th Street) or Curry (Murray) Hill."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"They get points for having an insane line-up of naan, perhaps 10 if my memory serves me, and my vegetable curry was really rocking, but the place loses major points for it's staff. Inattentive, unkind, and almost abrasive at times. I'm not sure if it was an off night, because few other reviews mention this point, but it really soured my evening. I'll likely head back to try their lunch buffet, where services simply isn't as important, but I find that there's a wealth of Indian restaurants in town, and if I'm doing dinner at one of them, it likely won't be Maharani."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,My boyfriend and I carry-out their vegetable mixed curry at least once a week. A wonderful atmosphere for eating in as well. I'd also recommend the vegetable pakora!
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"This place was very authentic. When you walk in and see the fennel seeds and smell the curry in the air, you know you're in for some savory goodness. I had the Aloo Chole and shared a Mixed Grill. Everything was flavorful and well made. Would definitely go back for the Tandoori Chicken."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Been back.  They had some kind of lamb dish on the buffet.  I love lamb so I fished the meat out and just ate that, the onion chutney (it's a nice moderate spice level), naan, and rice.  I think I put away about 2 lbs of lamb.  So for 9 dollars - that's not a bad deal.  

Only problem - you can't predict when they'll have the lamb and when they won't.  

bah"
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"I used to like it a lot more and frequented Maharani while I live downtown. I love their Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Grilled Fish, and various forms of curries, especially the lamb and beef. Their naan and house made mango ice-cream top my list of favorites too. 

However, on one occasion after a meal I felt super thirsty throughout the entire afternoon, and had to keep drinking water non-stop. Not the greatest feeling after a buffet. Since then I haven't been back for a while.

Recently my lab had a craving for Indian buffet and they talked me into giving it another try. The food was good, but the feeling of addiction in the past didn't kick in. There are many others in the community, my friends included, who love Maharani. Personally I don't see myself going back in a (long) while. I know this is not going to be particularly helpful but I would suggest people to go once and decide for yourself if this is for you. And it will help too to go with an open mind and try the wide spread of food they have on offer. And if you do go I will be happy to hear any thoughts =)"
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,Their chicken Tikka Masala and the lamb byriani were very good and so were the portions.
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"I've only had takeout. No major complaints. I would order for a reliable hot meal, but so far nothing has blown my mind.

The lamb curry was kind of spicy but besides that not as flavorful as I would prefer. Supposedly comes with yogurt but if it's in the sauce I couldn't tell. Next time will ask for it as a side as well. Generous with the lamb; lots of big, delicious pieces in my dish! Would've liked some more veggies or something to break up the broth in addition to the meat.

Chicken 65 was pretty good and the naan was great but I've never seen a restaurant mess up naan.

Gotta go back for the buffet. It's kind of expensive to do takeout from here so that should be a more affordable way to sample the menu."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"Three of us showed up at 7:15 PM on Labor Day  (National holiday). We were seated at a booth in what was probably the waiting area; not great, but we were happy to find a place that was open. We ordered 3 entrees (a lamb, a chicken & an eggplant) and some naan  (bread) to share. It took longer than I thought it would. Our food was finally delivered and the first thing we noticed is that they all looked alike and the portions seemed small. The entrees were tasty, but not distinctive. The service was only OK. But again, they get extra points for being open."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"This restaurant went from being 5 stars to 4 to 3. The food was fantastic. We placed our orders for rasam, chicken vindaloo and rice. After we placed or orders, we got complimentary papadum, which was good. It took quite a long time to get the rasam, but when we got the it, it reminded me exactly of how my family makes it back home. I enjoyed every bite of it, and wanted more after I was done. Then we waited a very long time for our entree, but of course when we got it, we enjoyed it very much. It was pretty spicy, and because of the lack of attention our table got, we didn't get any refills of water after the first one, and we were struggling with the heat of the food. When we finished our food, it took 20 minutes to get the attention of someone to give us our check. Finally, a woman who was not our server saw us looking around and came to help us. I ordered a mango lassi to go, and she came back with that and the check soon after. The mango lassi was super good! It took another 10 minutes to get our server to pick up the check from us... He passed our table multiple times but didn't even look at us. I finally stopped him when he passed us to ask if we pay up front, and it was only then where he took the check from me. Overall, the food was great but the service was bad. It seemed like it was only our server that wasn't attentive, the others looked a little better. I would definitely just order take out from here so I can get good food without the slow service."
Maharani Restaurant,lamb vindaloo curry,"This is really a 3 and a half! I went for the lunch buffet, and I'd say half the dishes were great and half were pretty low quality. Some tasty things worth noting were the Green Beans Poriyal which were incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly and a cauliflower dish I forget the name of. I wouldn't recommend the Dahi Vada (those donut-looking things) unless they're freshly out on the table, cuz they get so soggy so quickly! The paneer dish I had was good, the tikka masala was nice, but the fried fish dish was pretty blah- not fresh, and there's nothing worse than not-fresh fish! Dessert was yummy but the staple Indian buffet mango ice cream just tasted like vanilla grocery store ice cream flavored lightly with mango. Tip-if you're going anywhere important later, be careful, because you'll walk around smelling strongly of delicious curry for the rest of the day! You decide if that's a good or bad thing."

Chili's,boneless buffalo chicken salad,"Our waiter was very friendly, he had a southern accent. I could not tell if he was a high school kid or college kid but he was very friendly and provided great service. 
I had the lunch special - half soup and half salad.
For soup I had the chili- it was way too soupy. Come on, pack the protein, more beans and more meat please!
The cobb salad was not bad. The avocado dressing that came with it was delicious. And $7 for that? Oh yeah."
Chili's,boneless buffalo chicken salad,"Not sure what's going on, but I used to enjoy eating here. Quality was just not up to snuff. I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad. Though the salad itself was fine, it could have been more chilled, it really didn't taste cold. The chicken though, tasted freshly grilled and was good. Another issue I had about the unchilled salad was that the plate had just come out of the dishwasher, it was warm. A salad should arrive on a chilled plate. My son's fried chicken strips and fried didn't look impressive, and neither did my husband's ribs. 
Actually the Buffalo wings we ordered as an appetizer were probably the best tasting of everything during the visit. 
Update: visited this location again, and had a better experience. Ordered the chicken enchiladas. No complaints, they were tasty. Also ordered the molten chocolate cake dessert to share with my daughter. Whoooo... yummy. Cake part slightly dry, but the flavors were good."

The atmosphere is typical of the chain, and kept clean enough.

The only downside was the waiter.  He messed up the drink order by bringing a Corona instead of the Blue Moon and included the up sell beans and rice, which I had told him I didn't want at time of order.  Both mistakes seemed to be intended to get the ticket price up to increase his tip."

I had the lunch special - half soup and half salad.
For soup I had the chili- it was way too soupy. Come on, pack the protein, more beans and more meat please!
The cobb salad was not bad. The avocado dressing that came with it was delicious. And $7 for that? Oh yeah."

I got food poisoning from this establishment.

I feel bad, because I can tell the woman who owns the place is a kind lady, but due to my food poisoning issue,  I think she really needs to rethink what they are doing in the kitchen.

I ordered the soup, the chicken rafissa (sp?) and my hubby ordered the chicken bastilla. 

The soup tasted as if it was minestrone with a few added spices.  Not luxury and it was lukewarm.

The chicken rafissa seemed like it tasted ok! It was heavy looking---not much color in the dish---just a brown sloppy appearance.  But the crisped up puff pastry was what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, the pastry was overly drenched in oil---too greasy for my liking. The flavors were ok, but it was too heavy overall. 
My experience with moroccan food previously was not so drab.   But, I did eat a majority of it, as it wasn't that bad.  The chicken was ok, but it seemed lukewarm as well.  I can guarantee that this was not made fresh, but simply reheated and put in a tagine for decoration.  They forgot my saffron rice, and when the waitress (finally) came back and asked how things were---she finally gave me some---very little actually....

My hubby liked his chicken bastilla. I had a bite and didn't much care for the flavor combination---im not a fan of sweetness from cinnamon and savory egg at the same time.  

The bill came back with soup being charged extra.
On the  topic of prices---This food is WAY overpriced. IT should have been 7 bucks for my meal. 

If this restaurant is going to survive, which I'm not sure---They need to be willing to rethink how they do things in the back of the kitchen.  Whatever they did gave me food poisoning.   THey need to cook things fresh, have better attention todetails and also have lesser prices."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"I ordered delivery from Marrakesh through Mr. delivery since I was visiting in town and thought the menu sounded nice. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed.

We ordered a vegetable tangine, chicken tangine, Mohamara dip and vegetarian Bastila. The tangines were very disappointing. They had little flavor or spice. I have made a more flavorful tangine in the past myself. My husband thought the same of his chicken dish. The green beans in the vegetable version were canned and not fresh. The portions were very small and barely covered the bottom of the take out box. I would not recommend this dish.

The Mohamara dip was okay but also had little flavor. It was slightly greasy. It was also a small portion but with a lot of pita but we still didn't finish the dish.

The Bastila was the best item we got. It had a lot of authentic spice and was full of vegetables. The portion was big. I would recommend it. Overall we would not order here again since most items were disappointing."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"""I have a bad feeling about this...""

I first attempted to visit this place during their opening 2 weeks. When I went, the dining rooms were quite full, but all the diners looked unhappy.  The harried waiter said that we coudl eat there, but it would take 1.5 hours to get our food due to the kitchen and servers being too busy. It was not laziness on his part, but rather that there were 2 servers for 2 dining rooms. I saw diners who looked very unhappy with nothing in front of them. We quickly left.

I returned in 2014 for dinner and fortunately it was not the chaos we previously encountered. The layout of the restaurant is very odd--I get the feeling it would be more successful if they didn't have 2 dining rooms. At night, the curtains to the dining room are halfway  up; however, it doesn't block the headlights of cars that park directly in front of the building so you get big shining lights in the restaurant if someone's starting up their car.

When asked, we said that we were OK sitting anywhere in the restaurant, which was at less than 25% of capacity. Yet we were placed in a table in view of the restroom.  

I'm not sure our server checked on how we were doing 1x while we were eating.  The dishes were really expensive; you basically have 3 kinds of main entrees and a lamb tagine is $17 with no sides or appetizers.  As for the food, if you told me that the tagine was from any part of the world, I would have believed you. It did not have any distinctive flavor other than meat&veggie stew.  The b'stilla, a dish with cinnamon, sugar, eggs, pastry dough, and chicken, was all right but a little more quiche-like than being encrusted in pastry.

I am very glad we had a Bucky Book coupon as this was not worth the full price, and I don't really consider it to be worth the coupon price either."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"I wish Yelp would allow for half stars, because in that case I would have given Marrakesh 3 1/2 stars. 

I was always a huge fan of the Shish Cafe and sad to see it close. So when I read about Marrakesh in the paper I was so excited to go try it that I went there for dinner the same day I read about it. 

They did an amazing job cleaning up the exterior and interior of what used to the Shish. The restaurant looks much cleaner and more appealing overall with fresh vibrant colors. They also put up drywall where you used to be able to see into the kitchen which is nice and the restaurant looks more spacious than it used to. 

Our server was very friendly and attentive. I had the mint tea which was outstanding. We also had the eggplant appetizer Zaaluk which was also really good. I wish they would have served more pita bread with it. 

For an entree I ordered the Chicken Tajine and my partner ordered the Chicken Brochette. Both were served with rice. The portions were not as big as I would have thought they would be for the price. I wish there would have been more food. The Tajine was good. I was a little disappointed in the olives that were used. I expected big juicy mediterranean olives and instead they were simple pimento olives. I cannot recall the name of the Moroccan restaurant that used to be downtown Madison but there Chicken Tajine tasted better in my opinion. Their sauce was better and the flavor of the preserved lemon was more prevalent. My partner's Chicken Brochette was excellent. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and the meat was really tender. The yoghurt dipping sauce was great and you could tell it had some sour cream mixed into it. 

I will definitely go back again. Like I said I just wish their portions were bigger."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"I was really excited to see a Moroccan place open in Madison. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to my expectations. The ambiance was a little uncomfortable, the food was mediocre, the service was slow, and the prices were steep. 

We were seated at one of the tables against the wall, which is one long bench/booth adorned with cushions. The idea is cute, but in reality it is just uncomfortable. There is a reason food is served at a table with chairs that reach it adequately. Also, another group was seated at the same bench as us, and was sitting literally inches away from me when the restaurant was fairly empty and there were several open tables. Talk about awkward! The music was too quiet, and it felt like you couldn't talk openly at your table, as the whole room could hear you. Also, one of the waiters kept staring at our table, which made me feel even more uncomfortable.

We ordered the Lamb Tagine and the Chicken Couscous. The food took a long time to come. It was decently spiced, and the chicken was cooked really well. I was impressed with how juicy it was. The lamb, on the other hand, was dry and overcooked. Tagine usually has some dried apricot and lemon in it, both of which were lacking. Both dishes tasted almost the same, which is strange because they are very different dishes. The saffron rice that came with the tagine was a frightening bright yellow-orange color. Saffron does impart color on rice, but never that bright. It looked like they had put turmeric in it to make it even more colored. I've had some amazing Moroccan food at restaurants in Los Angeles, and sadly this food did not compare.

While our waitress was very nice, she simply didn't come by enough to check on our water, etc. Given that the restaurant was pretty empty, this was unexpected. 

The dishes on the menu were all around $15-18, and the portions are pretty small. In my experience, Moroccan restaurants are on the more expensive side, but we're in Madison, people, come on! This city is supposed to be affordable! The BF was still hungry after dinner, and I was actually able to finish my whole meal and still felt dissatisfied. I almost never finish my meal when I eat out, so that's saying something.

I think I'll just wait till I'm back in LA to have Moroccan food again."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"We haven't been here in a long time and we were really pleased with our meal.  Very authentic  chicken tagine with raisins and chicken peas. Chicken was ver tender and delicious blend of flavor. The other dish we had was the vegetable  Bastila which was phyllo stuffed with vegetables with yogurt. The pastry was nice and flakey with a browned top. 

It was a pretty quiet night, only a few tables. Give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"I've never eaten *in* here before, so I can't speak to the service or decor much at all. It's pretty dark is all I can so.

Marrakesh catered for a Thomas Piketty book club event we had, and we ordered tons of stuff: meditterean (sp) salad, hummus, vegetables, and chicken tagine. All of us thought the food was off the charts, and I didn't think it was too oily and greasy at all (like I sometimes do with Moroccan restaurants). If you are looking for ethnic cuisine that's less commonplace in Madison, I'd definitely check them out.

They are a little hard to find because of poor signage, but with a couple U-turns, you should get to it without trouble."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisine situated in West Madison right off University Ave. It's easy to spot but if you're driving too fast it's easy to miss the turn. Mediterranean cuisine is not common in Madison and having one on the west side in addition a couple that are downtown is great.

Their lentil soup is good. Classic dish with soft lentils and spices makes this a flavorful appetizer. We also had the sampler plate with hummus, zaaluk and tabouli. The hummus and zaaluk (grilled eggplant) were good. For entrees we had the chicken tangine with couscous, lamb tangine and the seafood bastila. Their tangines are served in an earthenware pot with a cute little cover - nice presentation. I have always been a fan of chicken tangine with couscous, soft and succulent pieces of meat in a nice savory stew sauce. The bastila is also awesome with thin crispy layers of pastry crust with generous serving of seafood (or choice of meat and other fillings). Those bastilas fill you up pretty fast, I highly suggest sharing one amongst the table.

Service was really slow. Be prepared for significant waiting times at every stage - water, ordering, being served and getting the check. We were there on early on a weekday night and they were not too busy, but still we waited for quite a bit. Later into the evening as more people came, the waits became longer. It seems like they are under staffed?

The portions were big and will fill you up. However, for some of their dishes like the curries and kebobs, I feel like you could get something of similar quality downtown for less. I would head back for their specialty dishes such as the bastila, when I am looking for a slow dinner or have loads of waiting time to spare."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"I had been looking forward to eating at Marrakesh and finally got the chance last night for a special dinner with my wife. I couldn't have been more disappointed. We shared a hummus appetizer and the chicken couscous. The hummus was fair, the bread was stale and the entree was terribly over cooked with very little flavor. As someone else noted that this used to be the Shish Cafe makes it even worse.

Our waiter was very friendly which is the only reason I gave 2 stars and unlike other reviews talking about slow service, we had little wait since there was almost no one else there. Also, the prices are very high, especially considering what you get."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"So, this is my first try at Moroccan food and I simply love it! I've tried several Mediterranean place all over the States before, but this is by far my favorite Mediterranean place. Here's how it went down!

Pros:

1) Food is really tasty. And let's face it, how many places are there in Madison where you can get Moroccan food? I had the Chicken Tagine -chicken was perfectly cooked and covered in this mouthwatering sauce. My boyfriend and I basically finished almost every drop of the sauce, pouring it over our delicious saffron rice. Waiter said it's made of lots of spices, which all combined makes the most wonderful taste. I also made a rather strange request of substituting some of the ingredients with those matched with the Beef Tagine, but the waiter was pretty cool about it. I received the dish exactly how I asked for. Boyfriend had the beef kabob, which really, is probably pretty hard to mess up. He liked it.

2) Small menu. Reduces the amount of decision-making I have to make.

3) Decor is prettty awesome! They seated us in this comfy couches and I loved that we had privacy because there was nobody else in our seating section.

4) Because it's our first time sampling Moroccan food, waiter let us try some Moroccan mint tea. It's good but can taste a bit strange at first. Best part is it came in a cute little teapot and teacups, and the waiter poured out the tea most professionally (even though the teapot was boiling hot when I tried to repeat the same feat.)

Cons:

1) Service is pretty slow. This is a good and a bad thing. Good is, the waiter, unlike waiters in a lot of American restaurants, doesn't come pester you every five minutes. Bad is, we waited at least ten minutes for him to take our credit card so that we can up and leave. 
 
2) Dishes are rather pricey for the serving size. 

If you're sick of the standard American/Asian places around this area, then I'd say you should definitely check this place out at least once. Good food but pricey."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"This place is great. I went with 2 friends. We ended up getting a vegetarian tagine, a chicken tagine, and a lamb tagine with apricots. All were amazing! Aromatic! Tasty! We immediately understood why this place is rated the #1 restaurant in Madison on Trip Advisor!

We also got the baklava, which was to die for! The mint tea was delicious as well. 

The food was perfect and our waitress was the owner and the chef! She was very friendly and welcoming. We felt like we were family.

I returned another time and had the vegetarian couscous! It was amazing. 

Both times I went it was super busy. The service was fine! I don't know what people are talking about. It's not a fast-food chain, obviously, it might take 15 minutes for your food to come out."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"We were excited about going to the Marrakesh for the first time.  We were the first ones to enter the restaurant, followed by one other party.  With only two tables full at the time (a few more people came later), the level of service we received was disappointing and puzzling.  A nice young man led us to our table, gave us menus, told us a different person would be our waiter, and then vanished.  We must have waited 20 minutes before we even got water and were able to order.  Our two drinks took forever to come.  Our hummus -- which we really enjoyed -- took forever to come.  At every step of the way, the service was excruciatingly slow, which was inexplicable given that for awhile there were just two tables filled in the whole place, and each table was assigned a different waiter.  (Eventually there were 5 tables full, split between the two waiters.)  When we finally received our Chicken Tagine, we really enjoyed it, despite the accompanying rice being barely warm.  We assume this is a family-run business and we'd like to see it do well.  We know that running a restaurant is hard work.  But for most of the night, we were pretty much abandoned.  No one ever asked us if we'd like anything more, no one came by to see how we liked the food, and there was no waiter even walking past in the dining room.  The restaurant definitely missed a chance to see if we wanted a second drink.  Unless the two waiters were also pressed into service as cooks -- in which case I apologize for this review -- there was no discernible reason why our service was almost nonexistent.  For almost the entire, extremely long time that we were there, the customers were alone in the dining room and the waiters had vanished like ghosts.  This was our wedding anniversary and we had some other things planned for after the meal which we were not able to do.  I really hope that Marrakesh will read these reviews and make some serious efforts to improve their service, as there are many competing restaurants in town which offer good food AND good service.  I wish them well."
Marrakesh,chicken brochette,"We ate here in the first week they were open. The service was really, really slow, but I suspect that will improve as they figure things out, and it is not the reason for the 2 star review. The food was. 

At first, things seemed great. We were promptly seated (although we were only the second table there) and promised a complimentary Turkish tea. After about 10 minutes the tea arrived. It was herbal, sweet, and delicious. However, we had not seen our waiter at all between being seated and getting the tea, so we didn't order until then and it felt slow. 

We started with the hummus, which was very good, and accompanied by a wonderful light, slightly chewy bread. For a main course, I ordered the Chicken Tagine, and my husband got the Beef Tagine. Both were disappointing. The chicken was dry and overcooked, which is a little odd for a tagine dish. There was very little sauce, and two small strips of preserved lemon and a few olives. It also was absolutely under seasoned and under salted. The beef tagine was also overcooked, dried out, and tough. It was also a very cheap cut of beef, a very fibrous cut (like chuck) and honestly, for a $15 dish, I expect a little higher quality meat. It was literally about $3 worth of beef, with a hard cooked egg and a few prunes. It was also under seasoned, which given the description on the menu was surprising. 

Overall, it felt like the meal (at about $50 total with tax and tip - no drinks) was not worth the price, and I do not often say it. It's too bad, because the Shish Cafe (which used to occupy the space) was really excellent."

Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"I just returned from one of the most amazing dishes in Madison. I had to write about it. The lamb tagine at Marrakesh may be the best entree I've ordered in this city. In my opinion, you're either a lamb person or you're not. For those who are, this is a must-try dish. Like many entrees at Marrakesh, it arrives in a clay tagine with a cone-shaped top that the server removes. Underneath is a very warm plate brimming with tender pieces of lamb and a perfectly finished medley of carrots, potatoes and peas. My wife had the chicken couscous, which she loved. The ""Flavor of Sahara"" bar--with dates, nuts and sesame seeds and date syrup--is a great way to end the dinner. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The service here has been consistently good in our experience. The prices are admittedly a bit high, but the quality is superb. This one's a keeper.

6/12/2014 I had forgotten about my prior review and just came back from a fantastic meal at Marrakesh. I thought, ""let's write a review."" So, another year of visits later. I have tried the vegetarian bastilla and love it: crispy on the outside, bursting with delicious vegetables on the inside. My wife loves the fish tagine. The mohamara (a pepper spread) is also very good, although I prefer mine a bit spicier.  There's just nothing like Marrakesh in Madison."

For dessert we tried the flavor of sahara, which my friends were crazy about but I thought it was a little chewy. The mint tea was very good. 

The food was excellent and we all were very pleased and immediately were talking about when we could go back. Our waitress seemed new but she was very sweet and helpful. My only complaint was the bar menu - it seemed like there was a lot of wine but only a selection of five pretty standard beers. My friend also ordered a gin and tonic, pretty standard, but they didn't have tonic. I think he ended up having a gin and sparkling water, lol.

Also, another group was seated at the same bench as us, and was sitting literally inches away from me when the restaurant was fairly empty and there were several open tables. Talk about awkward! The music was too quiet, and it felt like you couldn't talk openly at your table, as the whole room could hear you. Also, one of the waiters kept staring at our table, which made me feel even more uncomfortable.

We ordered the Lamb Tagine and the Chicken Couscous. The food took a long time to come. It was decently spiced, and the chicken was cooked really well. I was impressed with how juicy it was. The lamb, on the other hand, was dry and overcooked. Tagine usually has some dried apricot and lemon in it, both of which were lacking. Both dishes tasted almost the same, which is strange because they are very different dishes. The saffron rice that came with the tagine was a frightening bright yellow-orange color. Saffron does impart color on rice, but never that bright. It looked like they had put turmeric in it to make it even more colored. I've had some amazing Moroccan food at restaurants in Los Angeles, and sadly this food did not compare.

While our waitress was very nice, she simply didn't come by enough to check on our water, etc. Given that the restaurant was pretty empty, this was unexpected. 

The dishes on the menu were all around $15-18, and the portions are pretty small. In my experience, Moroccan restaurants are on the more expensive side, but we're in Madison, people, come on! This city is supposed to be affordable! The BF was still hungry after dinner, and I was actually able to finish my whole meal and still felt dissatisfied. I almost never finish my meal when I eat out, so that's saying something.

I think I'll just wait till I'm back in LA to have Moroccan food again."
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,Six of us met and ate a wonderful meal at the Marrakech. It was quiet enough to have a pleasant conversation with soft ethnic music playing in the background. The food came out and each of us had different dishes which we greatly enjoyed. I had an eggplant appetizer and chicken bastilla which were delicious. We will definitely return.
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"We haven't been here in a long time and we were really pleased with our meal.  Very authentic  chicken tagine with raisins and chicken peas. Chicken was ver tender and delicious blend of flavor. The other dish we had was the vegetable  Bastila which was phyllo stuffed with vegetables with yogurt. The pastry was nice and flakey with a browned top. 

It was a pretty quiet night, only a few tables. Give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"I've never eaten *in* here before, so I can't speak to the service or decor much at all. It's pretty dark is all I can so.

Marrakesh catered for a Thomas Piketty book club event we had, and we ordered tons of stuff: meditterean (sp) salad, hummus, vegetables, and chicken tagine. All of us thought the food was off the charts, and I didn't think it was too oily and greasy at all (like I sometimes do with Moroccan restaurants). If you are looking for ethnic cuisine that's less commonplace in Madison, I'd definitely check them out.

They are a little hard to find because of poor signage, but with a couple U-turns, you should get to it without trouble."
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisine situated in West Madison right off University Ave. It's easy to spot but if you're driving too fast it's easy to miss the turn. Mediterranean cuisine is not common in Madison and having one on the west side in addition a couple that are downtown is great.

Their lentil soup is good. Classic dish with soft lentils and spices makes this a flavorful appetizer. We also had the sampler plate with hummus, zaaluk and tabouli. The hummus and zaaluk (grilled eggplant) were good. For entrees we had the chicken tangine with couscous, lamb tangine and the seafood bastila. Their tangines are served in an earthenware pot with a cute little cover - nice presentation. I have always been a fan of chicken tangine with couscous, soft and succulent pieces of meat in a nice savory stew sauce. The bastila is also awesome with thin crispy layers of pastry crust with generous serving of seafood (or choice of meat and other fillings). Those bastilas fill you up pretty fast, I highly suggest sharing one amongst the table.

Service was really slow. Be prepared for significant waiting times at every stage - water, ordering, being served and getting the check. We were there on early on a weekday night and they were not too busy, but still we waited for quite a bit. Later into the evening as more people came, the waits became longer. It seems like they are under staffed?

The portions were big and will fill you up. However, for some of their dishes like the curries and kebobs, I feel like you could get something of similar quality downtown for less. I would head back for their specialty dishes such as the bastila, when I am looking for a slow dinner or have loads of waiting time to spare."
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"I had been looking forward to eating at Marrakesh and finally got the chance last night for a special dinner with my wife. I couldn't have been more disappointed. We shared a hummus appetizer and the chicken couscous. The hummus was fair, the bread was stale and the entree was terribly over cooked with very little flavor. As someone else noted that this used to be the Shish Cafe makes it even worse.

Our waiter was very friendly which is the only reason I gave 2 stars and unlike other reviews talking about slow service, we had little wait since there was almost no one else there. Also, the prices are very high, especially considering what you get."
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"So, this is my first try at Moroccan food and I simply love it! I've tried several Mediterranean place all over the States before, but this is by far my favorite Mediterranean place. Here's how it went down!

Pros:

1) Food is really tasty. And let's face it, how many places are there in Madison where you can get Moroccan food? I had the Chicken Tagine -chicken was perfectly cooked and covered in this mouthwatering sauce. My boyfriend and I basically finished almost every drop of the sauce, pouring it over our delicious saffron rice. Waiter said it's made of lots of spices, which all combined makes the most wonderful taste. I also made a rather strange request of substituting some of the ingredients with those matched with the Beef Tagine, but the waiter was pretty cool about it. I received the dish exactly how I asked for. Boyfriend had the beef kabob, which really, is probably pretty hard to mess up. He liked it.

2) Small menu. Reduces the amount of decision-making I have to make.

3) Decor is prettty awesome! They seated us in this comfy couches and I loved that we had privacy because there was nobody else in our seating section.

4) Because it's our first time sampling Moroccan food, waiter let us try some Moroccan mint tea. It's good but can taste a bit strange at first. Best part is it came in a cute little teapot and teacups, and the waiter poured out the tea most professionally (even though the teapot was boiling hot when I tried to repeat the same feat.)

Cons:

1) Service is pretty slow. This is a good and a bad thing. Good is, the waiter, unlike waiters in a lot of American restaurants, doesn't come pester you every five minutes. Bad is, we waited at least ten minutes for him to take our credit card so that we can up and leave. 
 
2) Dishes are rather pricey for the serving size. 

If you're sick of the standard American/Asian places around this area, then I'd say you should definitely check this place out at least once. Good food but pricey."
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"This place is great. I went with 2 friends. We ended up getting a vegetarian tagine, a chicken tagine, and a lamb tagine with apricots. All were amazing! Aromatic! Tasty! We immediately understood why this place is rated the #1 restaurant in Madison on Trip Advisor!

We also got the baklava, which was to die for! The mint tea was delicious as well. 

The food was perfect and our waitress was the owner and the chef! She was very friendly and welcoming. We felt like we were family.

I returned another time and had the vegetarian couscous! It was amazing. 

Both times I went it was super busy. The service was fine! I don't know what people are talking about. It's not a fast-food chain, obviously, it might take 15 minutes for your food to come out."
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"We were excited about going to the Marrakesh for the first time.  We were the first ones to enter the restaurant, followed by one other party.  With only two tables full at the time (a few more people came later), the level of service we received was disappointing and puzzling.  A nice young man led us to our table, gave us menus, told us a different person would be our waiter, and then vanished.  We must have waited 20 minutes before we even got water and were able to order.  Our two drinks took forever to come.  Our hummus -- which we really enjoyed -- took forever to come.  At every step of the way, the service was excruciatingly slow, which was inexplicable given that for awhile there were just two tables filled in the whole place, and each table was assigned a different waiter.  (Eventually there were 5 tables full, split between the two waiters.)  When we finally received our Chicken Tagine, we really enjoyed it, despite the accompanying rice being barely warm.  We assume this is a family-run business and we'd like to see it do well.  We know that running a restaurant is hard work.  But for most of the night, we were pretty much abandoned.  No one ever asked us if we'd like anything more, no one came by to see how we liked the food, and there was no waiter even walking past in the dining room.  The restaurant definitely missed a chance to see if we wanted a second drink.  Unless the two waiters were also pressed into service as cooks -- in which case I apologize for this review -- there was no discernible reason why our service was almost nonexistent.  For almost the entire, extremely long time that we were there, the customers were alone in the dining room and the waiters had vanished like ghosts.  This was our wedding anniversary and we had some other things planned for after the meal which we were not able to do.  I really hope that Marrakesh will read these reviews and make some serious efforts to improve their service, as there are many competing restaurants in town which offer good food AND good service.  I wish them well."
Marrakesh,chicken bastilla,"We ate here in the first week they were open. The service was really, really slow, but I suspect that will improve as they figure things out, and it is not the reason for the 2 star review. The food was. 

At first, things seemed great. We were promptly seated (although we were only the second table there) and promised a complimentary Turkish tea. After about 10 minutes the tea arrived. It was herbal, sweet, and delicious. However, we had not seen our waiter at all between being seated and getting the tea, so we didn't order until then and it felt slow. 

We started with the hummus, which was very good, and accompanied by a wonderful light, slightly chewy bread. For a main course, I ordered the Chicken Tagine, and my husband got the Beef Tagine. Both were disappointing. The chicken was dry and overcooked, which is a little odd for a tagine dish. There was very little sauce, and two small strips of preserved lemon and a few olives. It also was absolutely under seasoned and under salted. The beef tagine was also overcooked, dried out, and tough. It was also a very cheap cut of beef, a very fibrous cut (like chuck) and honestly, for a $15 dish, I expect a little higher quality meat. It was literally about $3 worth of beef, with a hard cooked egg and a few prunes. It was also under seasoned, which given the description on the menu was surprising. 

Overall, it felt like the meal (at about $50 total with tax and tip - no drinks) was not worth the price, and I do not often say it. It's too bad, because the Shish Cafe (which used to occupy the space) was really excellent."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"If I could give 0 stars I would. 
I got food poisoning from this establishment.

I feel bad, because I can tell the woman who owns the place is a kind lady, but due to my food poisoning issue,  I think she really needs to rethink what they are doing in the kitchen.

I ordered the soup, the chicken rafissa (sp?) and my hubby ordered the chicken bastilla. 

The soup tasted as if it was minestrone with a few added spices.  Not luxury and it was lukewarm.

The chicken rafissa seemed like it tasted ok! It was heavy looking---not much color in the dish---just a brown sloppy appearance.  But the crisped up puff pastry was what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, the pastry was overly drenched in oil---too greasy for my liking. The flavors were ok, but it was too heavy overall. 
My experience with moroccan food previously was not so drab.   But, I did eat a majority of it, as it wasn't that bad.  The chicken was ok, but it seemed lukewarm as well.  I can guarantee that this was not made fresh, but simply reheated and put in a tagine for decoration.  They forgot my saffron rice, and when the waitress (finally) came back and asked how things were---she finally gave me some---very little actually....

My hubby liked his chicken bastilla. I had a bite and didn't much care for the flavor combination---im not a fan of sweetness from cinnamon and savory egg at the same time.  

The bill came back with soup being charged extra.
On the  topic of prices---This food is WAY overpriced. IT should have been 7 bucks for my meal. 

If this restaurant is going to survive, which I'm not sure---They need to be willing to rethink how they do things in the back of the kitchen.  Whatever they did gave me food poisoning.   THey need to cook things fresh, have better attention todetails and also have lesser prices."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"I just returned from one of the most amazing dishes in Madison. I had to write about it. The lamb tagine at Marrakesh may be the best entree I've ordered in this city. In my opinion, you're either a lamb person or you're not. For those who are, this is a must-try dish. Like many entrees at Marrakesh, it arrives in a clay tagine with a cone-shaped top that the server removes. Underneath is a very warm plate brimming with tender pieces of lamb and a perfectly finished medley of carrots, potatoes and peas. My wife had the chicken couscous, which she loved. The ""Flavor of Sahara"" bar--with dates, nuts and sesame seeds and date syrup--is a great way to end the dinner. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The service here has been consistently good in our experience. The prices are admittedly a bit high, but the quality is superb. This one's a keeper.

6/12/2014 I had forgotten about my prior review and just came back from a fantastic meal at Marrakesh. I thought, ""let's write a review."" So, another year of visits later. I have tried the vegetarian bastilla and love it: crispy on the outside, bursting with delicious vegetables on the inside. My wife loves the fish tagine. The mohamara (a pepper spread) is also very good, although I prefer mine a bit spicier.  There's just nothing like Marrakesh in Madison."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"I ordered delivery from Marrakesh through Mr. delivery since I was visiting in town and thought the menu sounded nice. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed.

We ordered a vegetable tangine, chicken tangine, Mohamara dip and vegetarian Bastila. The tangines were very disappointing. They had little flavor or spice. I have made a more flavorful tangine in the past myself. My husband thought the same of his chicken dish. The green beans in the vegetable version were canned and not fresh. The portions were very small and barely covered the bottom of the take out box. I would not recommend this dish.

The Mohamara dip was okay but also had little flavor. It was slightly greasy. It was also a small portion but with a lot of pita but we still didn't finish the dish.

The Bastila was the best item we got. It had a lot of authentic spice and was full of vegetables. The portion was big. I would recommend it. Overall we would not order here again since most items were disappointing."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"Update:
Instead of spending time making his business better, the owner boldly tracks me down, calls a family member and threatens to sue if my review is not taken down. it is called freedom of speech sir! also they set up a fake account on yelp, give themselves a 5 star rating under the name Yamna F. then they send me a condescending message from that same account. can this experience get any worse?? we'll see.
people's bakery sells donuts and lunch sandwiches and is a fast food restaurant 15 miles away from Marrakesh (full service, dinner only restaurant), menus don't share a single common item, so no competition there, and this is by no means an endorsement. I made no attempt to hide my identity as I have no reason to, in fact I posted experience specific details to help you remember us. We went to Marrakesh, ordered food, paid for it and reviewed it like any other community member would, plain and simple. An apology was received from this merchant in a private message acknowledging overreacting and frustrations with Yelps reviews overall, despite the unprofessional comment they left on my review. This review will be changed to 2 stars if no additional ill will is displayed by this Establishment and their personal Yelp account under Yamna F."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"""I have a bad feeling about this...""

I first attempted to visit this place during their opening 2 weeks. When I went, the dining rooms were quite full, but all the diners looked unhappy.  The harried waiter said that we coudl eat there, but it would take 1.5 hours to get our food due to the kitchen and servers being too busy. It was not laziness on his part, but rather that there were 2 servers for 2 dining rooms. I saw diners who looked very unhappy with nothing in front of them. We quickly left.

I returned in 2014 for dinner and fortunately it was not the chaos we previously encountered. The layout of the restaurant is very odd--I get the feeling it would be more successful if they didn't have 2 dining rooms. At night, the curtains to the dining room are halfway  up; however, it doesn't block the headlights of cars that park directly in front of the building so you get big shining lights in the restaurant if someone's starting up their car.

When asked, we said that we were OK sitting anywhere in the restaurant, which was at less than 25% of capacity. Yet we were placed in a table in view of the restroom.  

I'm not sure our server checked on how we were doing 1x while we were eating.  The dishes were really expensive; you basically have 3 kinds of main entrees and a lamb tagine is $17 with no sides or appetizers.  As for the food, if you told me that the tagine was from any part of the world, I would have believed you. It did not have any distinctive flavor other than meat&veggie stew.  The b'stilla, a dish with cinnamon, sugar, eggs, pastry dough, and chicken, was all right but a little more quiche-like than being encrusted in pastry.

I am very glad we had a Bucky Book coupon as this was not worth the full price, and I don't really consider it to be worth the coupon price either."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"I wish Yelp would allow for half stars, because in that case I would have given Marrakesh 3 1/2 stars. 

I was always a huge fan of the Shish Cafe and sad to see it close. So when I read about Marrakesh in the paper I was so excited to go try it that I went there for dinner the same day I read about it. 

They did an amazing job cleaning up the exterior and interior of what used to the Shish. The restaurant looks much cleaner and more appealing overall with fresh vibrant colors. They also put up drywall where you used to be able to see into the kitchen which is nice and the restaurant looks more spacious than it used to. 

Our server was very friendly and attentive. I had the mint tea which was outstanding. We also had the eggplant appetizer Zaaluk which was also really good. I wish they would have served more pita bread with it. 

For an entree I ordered the Chicken Tajine and my partner ordered the Chicken Brochette. Both were served with rice. The portions were not as big as I would have thought they would be for the price. I wish there would have been more food. The Tajine was good. I was a little disappointed in the olives that were used. I expected big juicy mediterranean olives and instead they were simple pimento olives. I cannot recall the name of the Moroccan restaurant that used to be downtown Madison but there Chicken Tajine tasted better in my opinion. Their sauce was better and the flavor of the preserved lemon was more prevalent. My partner's Chicken Brochette was excellent. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and the meat was really tender. The yoghurt dipping sauce was great and you could tell it had some sour cream mixed into it. 

I will definitely go back again. Like I said I just wish their portions were bigger."

Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"Very disappointing.

I am a huge fan of Moroccan food and was excited to finally (again) have a Moroccan restaurant in town.  My previous experience of Moroccan restaurants is that they have a wide variety of nicely flavored/spiced foods that satisfy the soul.  My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant last night and were very dissatisfied. We ordered the lamb tagine and lamb couscous

Here are some of the reasons I felt so disappointed with our meal.

PRICE:  The food is priced quite high for the the quantity and quality.  Each dish arrives ala cart. There is no salad, soup or bread included with the entree.  At $15-17 for main dish, the meal would top $19-24 when adding a salad or soup.  

PORTION SIZE:  The portion size was very small and included about 3 oz of lamb.  The overal size of the meal was closer to what one would expect for lunch .  For $16-17, this seemed extremely high priced.

SEASONING:  The dishes were not seasoned as one would expect for Moroccan food.  They were quite bland without any apparent seasoning or spices . The chef had a very heavy hand with the salt.  We both commented on how very salty the food was...to the point of discomfort.  The couscous dish arrive without any sauce or juice, making the food seem very dry.

SERVICE:  The service was slow and unattentive.  The food took about 30 minutes to arrive.  It seems with this type of slow service, the restaurant would provide at least flatbread at the table to keep diners occupied.  Our waitress did not return to check in after the food was served and only asked how things were after we had finished.  We said it was ""okay"" and she seemed satisfied with that?

AMBIENCE:  The new decor is pleasant.  However, the restaurant did not have a welcoming feel due to the lack of staff engagement.  We walked out the door after paying and there was no ""thank you"" or ""good bye"" or any staff in sight to even notice we were leaving.    

I'm very sad to have had such a disappointing experienced at Marrakesh, and wish I could have provided a better review."

I really hope that Marrakesh will read these reviews and make some serious efforts to improve their service, as there are many competing restaurants in town which offer good food AND good service.  I wish them well."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"We ate here in the first week they were open. The service was really, really slow, but I suspect that will improve as they figure things out, and it is not the reason for the 2 star review. The food was. 

At first, things seemed great. We were promptly seated (although we were only the second table there) and promised a complimentary Turkish tea. After about 10 minutes the tea arrived. It was herbal, sweet, and delicious. However, we had not seen our waiter at all between being seated and getting the tea, so we didn't order until then and it felt slow. 

We started with the hummus, which was very good, and accompanied by a wonderful light, slightly chewy bread. For a main course, I ordered the Chicken Tagine, and my husband got the Beef Tagine. Both were disappointing. The chicken was dry and overcooked, which is a little odd for a tagine dish. There was very little sauce, and two small strips of preserved lemon and a few olives. It also was absolutely under seasoned and under salted. The beef tagine was also overcooked, dried out, and tough. It was also a very cheap cut of beef, a very fibrous cut (like chuck) and honestly, for a $15 dish, I expect a little higher quality meat. It was literally about $3 worth of beef, with a hard cooked egg and a few prunes. It was also under seasoned, which given the description on the menu was surprising. 

Overall, it felt like the meal (at about $50 total with tax and tip - no drinks) was not worth the price, and I do not often say it. It's too bad, because the Shish Cafe (which used to occupy the space) was really excellent."
Marrakesh,lunch chicken bastilla,"Horrible horrible experience.

We came in there for lunch, it was not even that busy, but we had to wait for good 10 minutes in the hall before anyone was able to help us. Then the manager (owner?) came in and said he would be helping us today as there were no waiters available.   He sat us down and then went away to chat with another customer, which he did for another good 5 minutes before bringing us the menus.  We ordered some shawerma and it was disgusting- overcooked, tough as a leather shoe, completely unseasoned, etc.  I barely ate any of mine.  They also wanted to charge us for a piece of bread.  I was surprised that water was free.  During the whole meal the manager was too busy chatting up with someone else to even come and check on us.  Nobody even offered us extra water, I had to find him and ask  him for some. 

The only good thing about the restaurant is the decor.  But the food is not worth the price."
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,"What a great little hidden gem! EXCELLENT food and service.

Helbach's is new and located on the West Side, but don't think that means they aren't as trendy or high-quality as our Capitol coffee shops. I seem to have hit a streak of awesome coffee shops in Madison and this one was definitely one of them.

I had seen that they were new on Yelp, so I decided to try them out for lunch on the West side. The first thing that struck me as awesome was the interior of the place (along with the furniture). Helbach's is a family business and the interiors were done by their uncle. While we were there, they were also constructing a garden box out front to compliment the outdoor seating (which was also pretty cozy).

I got the fetish breakfast sandwich and loved it. The eggs were fresh and it came on a Madison Sourdough roll. My friend got the chicken salad sandwich on a croissant and also really enjoyed it. To drink, I got the peach roibos iced. Again, quite good.

The location is a bit off the beaten path, it's back behind the West Towne Mall on the road that Pier 1 is on, but totally worth the visit.

I'll definitely be back and passing the word onto my friends. The only complaint I have is that they're not closer to downtown where I live!"
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,"this place has a great vibe. i love how cozy and hip it feels at the same time. my house-made granola with almond milk was yummy and my husband said his egg, cheese,  and bacon breakfast sandwich was delicious. i also got the karme latte and my husband got the mocha. i thought it was strange that they only do one size on the espresso drinks but i can see why considering the cute mugs they use. the only caveat is the menu is very limited and it doesn't say that soy or almond milk is available even though they offer both. it'd be nice to see those options listed on the menu."
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,"The owner of Helbach's did a fabulous job of updating the old Victor Allen's space on D'Onfrio Drive.  By using repurposed wood and employing a blue and brown color scheme, they have given the location a rustic chic vibe, which was reinforced by the soft jazz playing in the back ground.  There is plenty of plenty of seating options, including a group of comfy chairs around a fireplace.  There also is a pleasant patio with outdoor seating. The Wi-Fi signal was strong and steady, despite a large lunch crowd when I visited. There also is a drive through window for those of you coffee achievers requiring caffeine on the go.

Helbach's offers the usual arsenal of coffee drinks, as well as teas and smoothies.  There is a display filled with a tempting variety of homemade pastries.  There is a small breakfast menu and a variety of sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I tried the Patagonia Beef sandwich and absolutely loved it.   It was both well designed and superbly executed - the roast beef was hot, tender and juicy and the homemade chimichurri sauce subtly boosted the ensemble's flavor.  Every great sammie needs a steller bread component and the grilled ciabatta from Madison Sourdough did not disappoint.   The lightly dressed greens on the sandwich would have benefited from being served as a side salad, as the heat from the beef turned them into mush by the time I consumed the second half of my sandwich.  While the sandwich was on the smaller side, I felt it was a solid value at $8.50, given the quality of the ingredients.

The staff was friendly and efficient.  I received my sandwich about ten minutes from the time I ordered.  While no own checked in after I received my food, I was thanked for coming in as I departed.  

In an area dominated by chain restaurants, Helbach's provides an oasis of homemade deliciousness.  I'm certainly looking forward to exploring more of the sandwich menu as well as enjoying some time on their patio this summer."
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,"I have read great reviews about this coffee shop and driven by it several times, so I though I would drop by for a late lunch. 

I came into the shop around 4 and was immediately greeted by a friendly worker. I ordered the Chicken Cashew Croissant ($8.50) and the Pure Health Smoothie ($5.00). The sandwich came on a fluffy croissant with a generous amount of filling. The spring greens were fresh, the grapes were crisp and sweet, chicken and the dressing were delightful. The smoothie was my personal favorite. This Pure Health smoothie contained papaya, beet greens, berries, and protein powder. I wasn't expecting much, but this smoothie was one of the best I had. You could tell they used real fruit and it was not too sweet. 

The bathrooms are tucked away in the corner, and they were very clean. 

Although the price was a bit high, the quality was worth it. All in all, it's a great place for small gatherings for lunch. I will surely return to try other items on the menu."
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,Love finding a family owned business! The ambiance is simply stunning. Stopped in for breakfast and enjoyed a breakfast sandwich and a latte... And it was fabulous. Family owned beats chain any day.
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,"Stopped in on an impulse this morning and was very glad I did! I had not been to this spot since it was a Victor Allens and couldn't believe it when I walked in, this place is absolutely adorable. I wish I hadn't been on my way to work cause I could have sat here all day. The decor and atmosphere are wonderful. They also have a drive-thru if you are looking for something quick! The staff was also friendly and I enjoy that it is locally owned. There is a nice selection of both baked goods and breakfast and lunch sandwiches, and of course a variety of different drinks. I ordered the Beam'r sandwich to-go and it was delicious. Sandwiches are all made to-order and it was surprising and refreshing to be able to eat a breakfast sandwich that didn't include a microwaved egg!  I am excited to return to try some other menu items and spend more time inside. I definitely recommend anybody try this spot out!"
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,"I love the vibe, decor, and presentation. The coffee however is not very pleasant :( The menu and staff are delightful! I sure wish they used real plates and utensils..or at least stir sticks. I hate wasting a plastic spoon for a simple stir. I enjoy that they offer maple syrup for alternative sweetner. I am sad to say they have no gluten free bread. Their trail mix bars are amazing! The avocado smash with bacon was incredible I hear, although, they were out of arugula when it was on their specials board. Having a real knife, real plate, and arugula would have made it a 5 star sandwich! The environment is one of my favs! I am very sad that I dont enjoy the coffee."
Helbachs Coffee House,the beam'r sandwich,"I really enjoyed my stop here with a friend.  I had the chicken and broccoli Caesar salad.  It was a generously big salad with very fresh ingredients.  It really was big enough for two servings.  My friend got the Reuben .  I got a few bites of that sandwich and it was very good.

I enjoyed the fresh brewed ice tea.  I enjoyed reading the menu and can not wait to explore it some more.  

The pastries all looked incredible.  I had something that was a small loaf of a cinnamon like cake.  It was good but I am dreaming about my next visit and getting that sticky bun.  I will update once I get a taste of that."
Helbachs Coffee House,the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich,"Helbachs is hands down one of the best coffee shops I have been too. The boys that own it do a phenomenal job. The coffee, tea, shakas (shakes) are amazing on a warm or cold day. Their desserts are absolutely to die for. The oatmeal peanut butter m&m cookie is most likely my favorite. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a good time to relax and have good food and drink good coffee"

It's family owned, and the staff is really friendly. The food is all from scratch and really unique! The SEC sandwich is my favorite, and if I'm feeling indulgent, the bourbon sticky bun is amazing. 

Don't plan on dashing in and out if you stop here; since the food is from scratch, relax and enjoy the experience! They do have a drive through, so grabbing coffee would be quick. 

Speaking of coffee- they have their own house blend, created from Just coffee. Cool to support local businesses on all fronts.

All in all, highly recommended."

It's a quaint little place with a great atmosphere. 

Got the SEC breakfast sandwich and damn was it good! Super hot, quality ingredients, and came with a yummy sauce.  At $8 it's a little pricy but really for the quality it's a great value.  They also make a mean cappuccino. Super quality beans; velvety and chocolate notes.  They also do the fancy heart pour.  Hands down the best coffee I've had in Madison yet. 

On top of all that the service was genuinely friendly, no fake smiles here. 

Will definitely come back and try some of their other sandwiches, which look great."

Great China,crab meat lo mein,"1) Where's the meat?  These dishes are all veggies and sauce.  Completely disappointed in the quantity of the meat!
2) is this meat?  Or is it rubber?  The struggle is real.  Completely disappointed in the quality of the meat.
3) what are these flavors? Salt and ginger for the chicken with cashews.  Salt and ginger for the beef in oyster sauce.  Salt and ginger on everything and way too much of it."
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"I ordered Cashew Chicken and Crab Ragoon for delivery. The crab ragoon was not that bad, but the cashew chicken just was not good. The sauce was so thick and tasted differently than what I am used to. It wasn't horrible, but I've had better from numerous other Chinese restaurants in Madison."
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"I think myself pretty patient, but enough already. I ordered delivery.The food came on time, but it was more expensive than it should have been for lunch specials- so clearly I was charged full price.  when  I went to sign the credit card receipt I crossed out the tip line, planning on tipping in cash. The guy took the receipt out of my hand and before I could pull cash out of my pocket said ""no tip? I am loosing money coming here!?"" Is it just me or is that really rude? 

After all that the food is only OK- I ordered the chicken and garlic sauce with fried rice. The rice was too salty and there was barely any chicken. The vegetable lo mein was OK. I will not order here again."
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"Abysmal atmosphere. White fluorescent lights, sad vinyl booths where you can watch the fish tank of turtles swimming furiously around, wishing THEY were on the menu so they could just stop swimming already, a self-serve water pitcher in the cold case containing canned sodas. 
Menu/food: Sadly subpar, even for Midwestern Chinese food. Sesame chicken was breading lumps with sketch meat inside (suicidal turtles?) and an orange sauce that wished it were as good as Panda Express's standard, Orange Chicken, egg rolls that were more skin than filling, and pork lo mein than tasted only of salt. The basic flavor of all dishes was... SALT. Maybe those are sea turtles...?
In short, this place is like Pong (with a broken screen) when what you want is a Nintendo 64."
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"This is a solid place for some fast chinese food.  We always order General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Chicken fried rice, cheicken/vegitable lo mein and crab rangoon.  Our order arrives in 25-30 minutes and is piping hot and delicious! for $25, you cant complain. This is our new go-to for Sesame Chicken cravings!  Yum!"
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"I'm not a total snob. 

I lied, I'm kinda a snob, particularly about ethnic food. The most ethnic thing about this place is the name, it's that bad. 

I would have been quite confused even if I were not a snob.

Long story short, chow mein with no noodles. WHAT? I have never in my life heard this. Chow mein literally means ""fried noodles"". I ordered shrimp fried noodles and got grocery store frozen shrimp on saucy lettuce with rice. 

Best part of this meal was the mountain dew. Don't judge me for drinking Dew either. This was my work lunch and the sugar/caffiene combo kick in the face was a valid need. 

I think my egg roll committed suicide. Just now. 

I'm totally eating this food as I write this and I'm only becoming more and more convinced that I ordered this food as some sort of punishment. The fact that it's this bad and I'm still eating it tells me I need to see my therapist again because self-harm is wrong."
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"This is definitely a place you would want to go for carry out or delivery only. There's a few tables inside, but no atmosphere whatsoever. That being said, we order from great China on a fairly regular basis and find it to be consistent. They have never messed up our order and normally say 30-45 minutes for delivery, but it ends up being more like 15-20 minutes, which is great. Delivery is free ($10 minimum order) and they always have coupons on their menu for free crab rangoons or fried rice (depending on how much your order was). I've heard that other Chinese restaurants in the area tatse better, but they are also a bit more expensive. I'm not a Chinese food connoisseur, so  for me this is just fine and I have no complaints!"
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"Good and very cheap for both lunch and dinner. Best cheap chinese food in the area! Crab rangoon free with lunches. Bought dinner for four people, lo mein noodles, chicken egg foo young, chicken fried rice, and general tso's chicken, and it was less than $30 bucks."
Great China,crab meat lo mein,I've been ordering from this joint since 2005 and honestly- I love it. I used to live right near it and just ordered out of convenience but I've moved away now and any time I'm coming through the area I love to grab something. We just had the Beef & Broccoli tonight and I love that it had thinly sliced carrots in it- excellent veggies (along with TONS of broccoli) and delicious meat. I pretty much stick with Beef & Broccoli and Cashew Chicken anywhere I go (I am a creature of habit and I fully own that...I like to enjoy familiar things). And these guys? They got those nailed. The place itself is nothing fancy but the staff is nice and the food is great!
Great China,crab meat lo mein,"I ordered food to be delivered, when i opened up my bag it was the wrong order, i tried calling back but they were closed so i waited and called them the next day and i told them what happened and the guy on the phone was extremely rude and said to call back tomorrow, then he hung up on me. So i called back the next day and the so called ""manager"" told me he was the one to take my order and that I said the wrong thing and it was my fault... I'm not even kidding; he actually told me that the ordered being messed up was MY fault. I also had gone there a few weeks before that and i ordered in and my Lo Mein had a small wing of an insect sitting on top of it. When i tried to take it back he tried to act like he didn't know what i was talking about.  i have never witnessed customer service as bad as this place."

Great China,broccoli with hot garlic sauce,"Abysmal atmosphere. White fluorescent lights, sad vinyl booths where you can watch the fish tank of turtles swimming furiously around, wishing THEY were on the menu so they could just stop swimming already, a self-serve water pitcher in the cold case containing canned sodas. 
Menu/food: Sadly subpar, even for Midwestern Chinese food. Sesame chicken was breading lumps with sketch meat inside (suicidal turtles?) and an orange sauce that wished it were as good as Panda Express's standard, Orange Chicken, egg rolls that were more skin than filling, and pork lo mein than tasted only of salt. The basic flavor of all dishes was... SALT. Maybe those are sea turtles...?
In short, this place is like Pong (with a broken screen) when what you want is a Nintendo 64."
Great China,broccoli with hot garlic sauce,live on the north side  such a food desert  anyway ordered chicken cashew for pickup. Tons of food enough for two meals  the chicken was minimal as was the cashews the sauce was non existent guys throw some fresh ginger and garlic in your sauce maybe add some 3crabs fish sauce in the end food was ok sauce no good easy fix by bumping up the sauce
Great China,broccoli with hot garlic sauce,I've been ordering from this joint since 2005 and honestly- I love it. I used to live right near it and just ordered out of convenience but I've moved away now and any time I'm coming through the area I love to grab something. We just had the Beef & Broccoli tonight and I love that it had thinly sliced carrots in it- excellent veggies (along with TONS of broccoli) and delicious meat. I pretty much stick with Beef & Broccoli and Cashew Chicken anywhere I go (I am a creature of habit and I fully own that...I like to enjoy familiar things). And these guys? They got those nailed. The place itself is nothing fancy but the staff is nice and the food is great!
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"1) Where's the meat?  These dishes are all veggies and sauce.  Completely disappointed in the quantity of the meat!
2) is this meat?  Or is it rubber?  The struggle is real.  Completely disappointed in the quality of the meat.
3) what are these flavors? Salt and ginger for the chicken with cashews.  Salt and ginger for the beef in oyster sauce.  Salt and ginger on everything and way too much of it."
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"Very predictable and never had problem with orders. Egg rolls, fried rice and pork Lo Mein are good and Order frequently. Just had chicken chop seuy and found to be tasty and not overwhelming."
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"I ordered Cashew Chicken and Crab Ragoon for delivery. The crab ragoon was not that bad, but the cashew chicken just was not good.

Great China,crab meat fried rice,Fried rice is very dry and the General Tso isn't really spicy. Portions are pretty good size. Never had them mess up my order which is good. Delivery is on part with other places.
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"This is a solid place for some fast chinese food.  We always order General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Chicken fried rice, cheicken/vegitable lo mein and crab rangoon.  Our order arrives in 25-30 minutes and is piping hot and delicious! for $25, you cant complain. This is our new go-to for Sesame Chicken cravings!  Yum!"
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"I'm not a total snob. 

I lied, I'm kinda a snob, particularly about ethnic food. The most ethnic thing about this place is the name, it's that bad. 

I would have been quite confused even if I were not a snob.

Long story short, chow mein with no noodles. WHAT? I have never in my life heard this. Chow mein literally means ""fried noodles"". I ordered shrimp fried noodles and got grocery store frozen shrimp on saucy lettuce with rice. 

Best part of this meal was the mountain dew. Don't judge me for drinking Dew either. This was my work lunch and the sugar/caffiene combo kick in the face was a valid need. 

I think my egg roll committed suicide. Just now. 

I'm totally eating this food as I write this and I'm only becoming more and more convinced that I ordered this food as some sort of punishment. The fact that it's this bad and I'm still eating it tells me I need to see my therapist again because self-harm is wrong."
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"I ordered from Great China last night and had the worst food ever. I ordered general tsao's chicken and house special friend rice. The food was delivered 40+ minutes after the order, was barely warm and had little to no flavor. I am also pretty sure the rice was old. For $22 dollars this was no where near satisfactory.  I will not be ordering from this restaurant again."
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"This is definitely a place you would want to go for carry out or delivery only. There's a few tables inside, but no atmosphere whatsoever. That being said, we order from great China on a fairly regular basis and find it to be consistent. They have never messed up our order and normally say 30-45 minutes for delivery, but it ends up being more like 15-20 minutes, which is great. Delivery is free ($10 minimum order) and they always have coupons on their menu for free crab rangoons or fried rice (depending on how much your order was). I've heard that other Chinese restaurants in the area tatse better, but they are also a bit more expensive. I'm not a Chinese food connoisseur, so  for me this is just fine and I have no complaints!"
Great China,crab meat fried rice,"Good and very cheap for both lunch and dinner. Best cheap chinese food in the area! Crab rangoon free with lunches. Bought dinner for four people, lo mein noodles, chicken egg foo young, chicken fried rice, and general tso's chicken, and it was less than $30 bucks."

Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,Pretty good for pizza in Madison. If your looking for good value and a simple pizza this could be your spot. Their twists with the pepperoni in them are absolutely delicious. Worth just grabbing by themselves.
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"We had a deep dish pizza, breadsticks and cinnamon sticks and instantly fell in love with this place!  The breadsticks are phenomenal!  Great flavor and some awesome dipping sauce to go with em.  
The pizza was excellent- prefect crust to toppings ratio.  We'll definitely be back!!"
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"If you enjoy your pizza being delivered fresh and in a timely manner, you should probably avoid Itzza Pizza. 

We have ordered from here a few times and it had been pretty decent at first, but there has been a noticeable decline in quality and delivery speed. The last time we ordered it took about an hour and a half and the pizza was cold by the time it arrived. I think we're done with this place."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Today my hubby and I adventure ourselves to try this pizza place for the first time, I placed the order online and the promised time was 7:15pm, it was 7:23 and no sound at the door. We called and the person sounded kind of confused and busy until he decided to call the driver to check on the time and said he would be here shortly. Finally, he showed up and we were happy to see him. 

We ordered two pepperoni rolls, a garden salad and a customized pizza with onions, ham, pineapple and pepperoni. Once I opened the box, my mouth started to salivate, it was very pretty to look at, the first bite ahhhhhhh......a delectable surprise, it had a nice interesting""grilled"" flavor, even the smell, it reminded me of ""carne asada"", not greasy at all and I loved the fact that the meats tasted mild, not very salty like other places. I agree the crust could be enhanced but I liked it, sometimes simple finds a  strange way to satisfy you ;)  

The pepperoni rolls were too soft for my taste with nothing special on them. The salad was the basic one, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots; However, the Italian dressing I asked for was definitely homemade and that is rare to find specially in a fast food restaurant, bonus!"
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"So far EVERYTHING we've had delivered has been delish! My fav is the Hawaiian pizza and just tried the classic Italian pizza, OMG so good! Love their wings also, had the plain and bbq.  This place is my go-to for sure for pizza. Thanks guys!!"

Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Outstanding. Those who vote 4 stars are just afraid to admit it. Best Chicago stuffed in town (no kidding), sandwiches are perfect, service always great, and prices unbeatable. You're dreaming if you want better pizza take out in Madison, snobs take a hike."

Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Very solid effort, rich decadent pizza.  Pizza doesn't really look like beautiful pictures on Facebook - crust is thinner and toppings do not fill up to the top as pictures of the garlic crust pan pizza seem to suggest.  I also expect pizza to be salty BUT DAMN this was SALTY."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Hands down the best deep dish and thin crust Chicago style pizza I've ever had. And I was just ate at Lou Malinatis in Chicago a couple weeks ago. It was ok, but it was no Itzza Pizza! I can't wait to go get one today as soon as they open!"
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Another great meal tonight!  Nothing better than a delicious pizza late at night when it is cold outside!!!

Thank you!!!!"
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"I'll give them another try, though.  I love Chicago pizza and had high hopes, but the deep dish here was a big let-down.  I liked the crust and the breadsticks, so next time we'll try a different pizza.  Nice staff and quick prep."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"I should have listened!  Read the other reviews that the pizza was too salty, but I figured those people were just pizza snobs and that everything would be delicious.  Wrong!  My lips were burning there was so much salt on our deep dish pizza.  I could hardly finish one slice.  Don't waste your time here, there are plenty of tasty pizza joints in Madison."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Chicago style deep dish pizza is the best. (I've ordered bacon & black olive & a pepperoni) tastes amazing and has the most delicious crust!
Delivery came quicker than the estimated time."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"This is definitely the best pizza place I have tried in town.  I've eaten pizza at just about everywhere there is in Madison, and this place is the best.  I ordered their deep dish pizza with three toppings and I chose chicken, spinach, and feta.  The crust is completely out of this world. It has a buttery, flaky texture and a cheesy flavor as well. not sure how they make it, but by far the best crust I've had in a pizza. DELICIOUS.

12/18/15 *update* this place may have gone down hill a bit.  5 out of the last 6 times I've ordered, something had been made or done incorrectly and it takes a good 60 to 90+ minutes to arrive. Once a big fan of this place, finding myself ordering pizza elsewhere now"
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,We read a review on the Cap Times (which is a garbage publication) and wanted to check it out. Their Italian Beef Meat Pie sounded awesome but after talking it up they left off the hot giardiniera that would have made the meal memorable. I called and complained and got a few bucks off of another order so next time we ordered a deep dish pizza. Their pizza wasn't all that memorable and we haven't been back.
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Itzza Pizza is the replacement for Gumby's on Madison's near west side

I had the chicago style stuffed pizza and it was good (very big!), but nothing like authentic gino's east or lou malnati's in chicago. The sauce, crust, cheese, and toppings were pretty average and what you would find at places like pizza di roma or glass nickel, at a little cheaper price.

The one thing this place has that no one else does: PEPPERONI ROLLS. Gumby's had them and they were the best and these are even better!! They're soft, chewy, and come with a side of what tasted like thousand island dressing with a kick. Very awesome.

I would rank this place average in every single quality: taste, presentation, location, delivery speed. But the pepperoni rolls won me over. Definitely worth a try."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"*Garlic Romano Deep Dish*

I'll get it right out of the way, the salt killed it for me. If this pizza weren't as salty as it is I'd easily give this place 5 stars. The crust is delicious but as I sit here drinking my fourth glass of water an hour after finishing eating, I just couldn't justify ordering it again. I love salt and only got through two slices. My other half took a few bites and said it was like eating a salt lick.

*Garlic Bread w/ Cheese*

Very solid. Definitely worth the few bucks they charge, not overly buttery (is there such a thing?) and not burnt. Just right!

I wanted to give this place 4 stars as a compromise but I'm just not certain it was a 'bad night' in terms of maybe adding too much salt to the sauce because other reviewers have pointed this out as well."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"We ordered both the thin crust as well as deep dish pizzas, and we didn't care for either.  The pizzas included far too much SALT and other spices, which were probably someone's way of covering up for the fact that the ingredients weren't really fresh. 

 I've had tons of deep dish pizza in Chicago, as well as amazing thin crust in Milwaukee.  Unfortunately, Itzza just doesn't cut it."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half cheese, 10 wings (sweet and tangy), and breadsticks. The pizza was bland like glass nickle and other Madison shops. Nothing like east coast pizza. The wings were super small! I feel cheated. If you know what a normal wingding looks like ....Itzza pizza wings are 1/4 that size. Lastly, the breadsticks were not bread sticks at all. It was a freaking loaf of bread with oil and cheese. I don't know what this place is thinking but need to up their game or they will be out of business like Gumbys."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Went there with the hubby over the weekend and have some helpful tips:

First, - it's difficult to find. If you pull into the IHOP parking lot, it's right behind (but connected to) IHOP. You can' see it from the street.

The pizza was great, but as several other reviewers said VERY salty. I thought this would be an exaggeration after reading the reviews, but i definitely noticed that they used more salt than needed in the sauce. Although I could have done without some of the salt, it did not ruin the experience for us and I still thought the pizza was good. I would definitely order rom Itzza Pizza again.

Also, there is not indoor seating (there's a small table with 2 chairs to sit in while you're waiting to pickup, but that's it).  We expected that it would be small place, but thought there would be a few tables to dine-in. Not that case though.

We got the deep dish stuffed pizza and this is definitely the place to go in Madison if you're looking for something similar to authentic chicago style pizza."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"This review is for the stuffed pizza. I got a small stuffed sausage and pepperoni expecting a very mediocre attempt at the Chicago style pie. I was wrong. The stuffed pizza was excellent. Plenty of sauce to balance the cheese and toppings within. Only complaint is the crust doesn't have much to it. Perhaps a little brush of butter or garlic could help. 

Also tried the pepperoni rolls (2 for $2.50) which were very good. Not a lot of filling, but very tasty. The Italian beef was the only thing I didn't enjoy. Bland meat that likely came from Walmart and saw little seasoning. 

Stick with the pizza and you'll enjoy it. Prices are great for stuffed/deep dish pizza as well. The location feels like your classic pizza dive as well (take out or delivery only) with the alluring smell."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,I gotta give these guys 4 stars because of the speed of delivery.  I don't know why in Madison most places are 50-60min to get a pizza these guys are usually to my door in about 30 min.  Give the thin crust a try it is pretty good.
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,Good pizza for a good price but the delivery driver was incredibly rude! Costumer service is everything people!!!
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Would give about 2.5 stars if I could. Had the regular pizza and breadsticks. Meh..  Not terrible, not memorable. Neither my husband or I cared for the sauce. Crust was ok. Definitely a lot of cheese if you like that. Generous with toppings. (Actually asked for mushrooms on half, got it on the whole pizza) 

Breadsticks were just pretty bad. Came with an odd cup of sauce on the side. I actually think it might have been a mistake? Tasted and looked like a watery thousand isle dressing? Yuck. Otherwise the topping was decent but the breadsticks were very bready. I know, breadsticks, right? But they weren't chewy in a focaccia way or melty like Olive Garden.. They were more like garlic Wonderbread?

Overall, we thought we would give it a try but I wish I had spent my $16 elsewhere and we won't be back."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"I've recently tried both the thin crust and stuffed deep dish and they are both delish. The pizza sauce and cheese are top notch. The crust isn't quite there yet (a little too crunchy instead of buttery flakey) but is still good. The deep dish is very filling,  just one slice is a meal in itself. This place is a dive, no dine-in, just carryout or delivery, and looks like a dump but it smells amazeballs inside. Staff are very friendly and couteous over the phone and in-person.  This is my takeout pizza go-to."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Itzza terrible and disgusting.

I was recently visiting Madison for the first time in many years.  After a night at some bars, I wanted some food.  I had attempted to go to Ian's, but the huge line/mob was far too big for me to deal with.  I then decided  I was craving some pokey stix from Gumby's pizza.  Unfortunately, it turns out that Gumby's has gone out of business.  After some searching on google, it seems that Itzza Pizza has opened in the Gumby's location and offers up itzza sticks, which they claimed were like pokey stix, only better.  That statement couldn't have been further from the truth.  

First off, they were an overpriced ripoff.  My $8.99 order came to just under $15.  There is really no way that tax and delivery came to roughly $6.  Unfortunately, I am not really sure of the price breakdown.  I decided not to question it as I was really craving something like pokey stix at ths point.  I just feel if you want to charge for delivery, have it listed on your website or menu.  What I received was inedible and disgusting.  The dough was undercooked, lacked seasoning, and was covered in far too much nasty mozzarella.  The cheese was some sort of fake, rubbery, oily, gelatinous, flavorless mess.  The only way to eat this was to pull off the cheese and drown it in ranch or marinara.  Even then it was still pretty nasty.  

While I am not familiar with the local late night eats in Madison anymore, I am sure that there are many far better options than this place."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,Pizza was not good at all. When I got the pizza It was warm but not hot. The pizza taste was terrible including the worst soggy crust. Not happy with the order and believe they need to seriously re-think what they are creating to keep customers.
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,Student special on pizza is the bomb. Friendly staff and food is always prepared extremely quick
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"I hate to do this, really I do, but man, the Garlic Romano Deep Dish Chicago was the worst pizza of my life.  We had two pieces each and threw out the rest.  I actually went out and bought some other pizza from another west side location to rectify dinner.  

Look, I bet if I were to flash back to my college days and order this beast at 2 am, I would be really, really happy.  Trying to feed a family and we need the quality to go up, significantly.  The crust was dry and falling apart, the sauce way to salty and the toppings lost.  I hate battering local places, and this is deserved based exclusively on the quality of the product.   

I really really wanted to like this join, nice folks working there, easy to order, prompt service and the place is a little hard to find.  But damn, the pizza was not good."
Itzza Pizza,deep dish pan cheese pizza,"Extremely amazing Hawaiian pizza !

The Hawaiian pizza is one of the best I have had so far ! Great value for your money. I got the medium pizza and I think there was enough meat and pineapple on it for a large. Everything tasted really fresh and the delivery was within 40 minutes. Really fast for such fresh tasting pizza. Great crust too . I will definitely be ordering this again."

2.  If you get an Italian sausage or sausage combo, as for no red sauce/marinara sauce/pizza sauce.  Inexplicably, ITTZA adds their red sauce to any sandwich with an Italian sausage involved.  I can see how you might want that if you're not getting your sandwich dipped in au ju, but I asked for mine dipped (as I always do) and they put red sauce on it, which clashed terribly with the au ju.  I've never known any other Chicago style restaurant to do this.  Scott, if you're reading, you might want to make it a thing, offer it dipped OR with red sauce, not both unless the customer asks.  I've already mentioned it to Mike."

The crust is delicious but as I sit here drinking my fourth glass of water an hour after finishing eating, I just couldn't justify ordering it again. I love salt and only got through two slices. My other half took a few bites and said it was like eating a salt lick.

*Garlic Bread w/ Cheese*

Very solid. Definitely worth the few bucks they charge, not overly buttery (is there such a thing?) and not burnt. Just right!

I wanted to give this place 4 stars as a compromise but I'm just not certain it was a 'bad night' in terms of maybe adding too much salt to the sauce because other reviewers have pointed this out as well."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"We ordered both the thin crust as well as deep dish pizzas, and we didn't care for either.  The pizzas included far too much SALT and other spices, which were probably someone's way of covering up for the fact that the ingredients weren't really fresh. 

 I've had tons of deep dish pizza in Chicago, as well as amazing thin crust in Milwaukee.  Unfortunately, Itzza just doesn't cut it."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half cheese, 10 wings (sweet and tangy), and breadsticks. The pizza was bland like glass nickle and other Madison shops. Nothing like east coast pizza. The wings were super small! I feel cheated. If you know what a normal wingding looks like ....Itzza pizza wings are 1/4 that size. Lastly, the breadsticks were not bread sticks at all. It was a freaking loaf of bread with oil and cheese. I don't know what this place is thinking but need to up their game or they will be out of business like Gumbys."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"Went there with the hubby over the weekend and have some helpful tips:

First, - it's difficult to find. If you pull into the IHOP parking lot, it's right behind (but connected to) IHOP. You can' see it from the street.

The pizza was great, but as several other reviewers said VERY salty. I thought this would be an exaggeration after reading the reviews, but i definitely noticed that they used more salt than needed in the sauce. Although I could have done without some of the salt, it did not ruin the experience for us and I still thought the pizza was good. I would definitely order rom Itzza Pizza again.

Also, there is not indoor seating (there's a small table with 2 chairs to sit in while you're waiting to pickup, but that's it).  We expected that it would be small place, but thought there would be a few tables to dine-in. Not that case though.

We got the deep dish stuffed pizza and this is definitely the place to go in Madison if you're looking for something similar to authentic chicago style pizza."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"This review is for the stuffed pizza. I got a small stuffed sausage and pepperoni expecting a very mediocre attempt at the Chicago style pie. I was wrong. The stuffed pizza was excellent. Plenty of sauce to balance the cheese and toppings within. Only complaint is the crust doesn't have much to it. Perhaps a little brush of butter or garlic could help. 

Also tried the pepperoni rolls (2 for $2.50) which were very good. Not a lot of filling, but very tasty. The Italian beef was the only thing I didn't enjoy. Bland meat that likely came from Walmart and saw little seasoning. 

Stick with the pizza and you'll enjoy it. Prices are great for stuffed/deep dish pizza as well. The location feels like your classic pizza dive as well (take out or delivery only) with the alluring smell."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,I gotta give these guys 4 stars because of the speed of delivery.  I don't know why in Madison most places are 50-60min to get a pizza these guys are usually to my door in about 30 min.  Give the thin crust a try it is pretty good.
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,Good pizza for a good price but the delivery driver was incredibly rude! Costumer service is everything people!!!
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"Would give about 2.5 stars if I could. Had the regular pizza and breadsticks. Meh..  Not terrible, not memorable. Neither my husband or I cared for the sauce. Crust was ok. Definitely a lot of cheese if you like that. Generous with toppings. (Actually asked for mushrooms on half, got it on the whole pizza) 

Breadsticks were just pretty bad. Came with an odd cup of sauce on the side. I actually think it might have been a mistake? Tasted and looked like a watery thousand isle dressing? Yuck. Otherwise the topping was decent but the breadsticks were very bready. I know, breadsticks, right? But they weren't chewy in a focaccia way or melty like Olive Garden.. They were more like garlic Wonderbread?

Overall, we thought we would give it a try but I wish I had spent my $16 elsewhere and we won't be back."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"I've recently tried both the thin crust and stuffed deep dish and they are both delish. The pizza sauce and cheese are top notch. The crust isn't quite there yet (a little too crunchy instead of buttery flakey) but is still good. The deep dish is very filling,  just one slice is a meal in itself. This place is a dive, no dine-in, just carryout or delivery, and looks like a dump but it smells amazeballs inside. Staff are very friendly and couteous over the phone and in-person.  This is my takeout pizza go-to."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"Itzza terrible and disgusting.

I was recently visiting Madison for the first time in many years.  After a night at some bars, I wanted some food.  I had attempted to go to Ian's, but the huge line/mob was far too big for me to deal with.  I then decided  I was craving some pokey stix from Gumby's pizza.  Unfortunately, it turns out that Gumby's has gone out of business.  After some searching on google, it seems that Itzza Pizza has opened in the Gumby's location and offers up itzza sticks, which they claimed were like pokey stix, only better.  That statement couldn't have been further from the truth.  

First off, they were an overpriced ripoff.  My $8.99 order came to just under $15.  There is really no way that tax and delivery came to roughly $6.  Unfortunately, I am not really sure of the price breakdown.  I decided not to question it as I was really craving something like pokey stix at ths point.  I just feel if you want to charge for delivery, have it listed on your website or menu.  What I received was inedible and disgusting.  The dough was undercooked, lacked seasoning, and was covered in far too much nasty mozzarella.  The cheese was some sort of fake, rubbery, oily, gelatinous, flavorless mess.  The only way to eat this was to pull off the cheese and drown it in ranch or marinara.  Even then it was still pretty nasty.  

While I am not familiar with the local late night eats in Madison anymore, I am sure that there are many far better options than this place."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,Pizza was not good at all. When I got the pizza It was warm but not hot. The pizza taste was terrible including the worst soggy crust. Not happy with the order and believe they need to seriously re-think what they are creating to keep customers.
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,Student special on pizza is the bomb. Friendly staff and food is always prepared extremely quick
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"I hate to do this, really I do, but man, the Garlic Romano Deep Dish Chicago was the worst pizza of my life.  We had two pieces each and threw out the rest.  I actually went out and bought some other pizza from another west side location to rectify dinner.  

Look, I bet if I were to flash back to my college days and order this beast at 2 am, I would be really, really happy.  Trying to feed a family and we need the quality to go up, significantly.  The crust was dry and falling apart, the sauce way to salty and the toppings lost.  I hate battering local places, and this is deserved based exclusively on the quality of the product.   

I really really wanted to like this join, nice folks working there, easy to order, prompt service and the place is a little hard to find.  But damn, the pizza was not good."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,"Extremely amazing Hawaiian pizza !

The Hawaiian pizza is one of the best I have had so far ! Great value for your money. I got the medium pizza and I think there was enough meat and pineapple on it for a large. Everything tasted really fresh and the delivery was within 40 minutes. Really fast for such fresh tasting pizza. Great crust too . I will definitely be ordering this again."
Itzza Pizza,chicago stuffed cheese pizza,This is my new favorite pizza place in Madison.  I think their pizza has a great flavor.  This is the only pizza place I have been ordering from lately.
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza",Pretty good for pizza in Madison. If your looking for good value and a simple pizza this could be your spot. Their twists with the pepperoni in them are absolutely delicious. Worth just grabbing by themselves.
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","We had a deep dish pizza, breadsticks and cinnamon sticks and instantly fell in love with this place!  The breadsticks are phenomenal!  Great flavor and some awesome dipping sauce to go with em.  
The pizza was excellent- prefect crust to toppings ratio.  We'll definitely be back!!"
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","If you enjoy your pizza being delivered fresh and in a timely manner, you should probably avoid Itzza Pizza. 

We have ordered from here a few times and it had been pretty decent at first, but there has been a noticeable decline in quality and delivery speed. The last time we ordered it took about an hour and a half and the pizza was cold by the time it arrived. I think we're done with this place."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Today my hubby and I adventure ourselves to try this pizza place for the first time, I placed the order online and the promised time was 7:15pm, it was 7:23 and no sound at the door. We called and the person sounded kind of confused and busy until he decided to call the driver to check on the time and said he would be here shortly. Finally, he showed up and we were happy to see him. 

We ordered two pepperoni rolls, a garden salad and a customized pizza with onions, ham, pineapple and pepperoni. Once I opened the box, my mouth started to salivate, it was very pretty to look at, the first bite ahhhhhhh......a delectable surprise, it had a nice interesting""grilled"" flavor, even the smell, it reminded me of ""carne asada"", not greasy at all and I loved the fact that the meats tasted mild, not very salty like other places. I agree the crust could be enhanced but I liked it, sometimes simple finds a  strange way to satisfy you ;)  

The pepperoni rolls were too soft for my taste with nothing special on them. The salad was the basic one, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots; However, the Italian dressing I asked for was definitely homemade and that is rare to find specially in a fast food restaurant, bonus!"
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","So far EVERYTHING we've had delivered has been delish! My fav is the Hawaiian pizza and just tried the classic Italian pizza, OMG so good! Love their wings also, had the plain and bbq.  This place is my go-to for sure for pizza. Thanks guys!!"
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","I would never know this was here if not for yelp. The entrance is completely unmarked and I initially mistook it for the service entrance to IHOP (they are in the same building). I ordered online and showed up early to pickup, which seemed to be uncommon. They have only two chairs and it's quite dark and dingy inside. That being said, the pizza was pretty good and prices reasonable (medium cheese deep dish, large sausage/pepperoni, and noodles for $33). But I'd stick to delivery next time."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Outstanding. Those who vote 4 stars are just afraid to admit it. Best Chicago stuffed in town (no kidding), sandwiches are perfect, service always great, and prices unbeatable. You're dreaming if you want better pizza take out in Madison, snobs take a hike."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Perfect medicine while spending time with my father in UW Hospital. Pizza was ready as promised,  very tasty and came with an online coupon too. Hard to find location,  look behind the IHOP."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Very solid effort, rich decadent pizza.  Pizza doesn't really look like beautiful pictures on Facebook - crust is thinner and toppings do not fill up to the top as pictures of the garlic crust pan pizza seem to suggest.  I also expect pizza to be salty BUT DAMN this was SALTY."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Hands down the best deep dish and thin crust Chicago style pizza I've ever had. And I was just ate at Lou Malinatis in Chicago a couple weeks ago. It was ok, but it was no Itzza Pizza! I can't wait to go get one today as soon as they open!"
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Another great meal tonight!  Nothing better than a delicious pizza late at night when it is cold outside!!!

Thank you!!!!"
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","I'll give them another try, though.  I love Chicago pizza and had high hopes, but the deep dish here was a big let-down.  I liked the crust and the breadsticks, so next time we'll try a different pizza.  Nice staff and quick prep."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","I should have listened!  Read the other reviews that the pizza was too salty, but I figured those people were just pizza snobs and that everything would be delicious.  Wrong!  My lips were burning there was so much salt on our deep dish pizza.  I could hardly finish one slice.  Don't waste your time here, there are plenty of tasty pizza joints in Madison."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Chicago style deep dish pizza is the best. (I've ordered bacon & black olive & a pepperoni) tastes amazing and has the most delicious crust!
Delivery came quicker than the estimated time."
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","This is definitely the best pizza place I have tried in town.  I've eaten pizza at just about everywhere there is in Madison, and this place is the best.  I ordered their deep dish pizza with three toppings and I chose chicken, spinach, and feta.  The crust is completely out of this world. It has a buttery, flaky texture and a cheesy flavor as well. not sure how they make it, but by far the best crust I've had in a pizza. DELICIOUS.

12/18/15 *update* this place may have gone down hill a bit.  5 out of the last 6 times I've ordered, something had been made or done incorrectly and it takes a good 60 to 90+ minutes to arrive. Once a big fan of this place, finding myself ordering pizza elsewhere now"
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza",We read a review on the Cap Times (which is a garbage publication) and wanted to check it out. Their Italian Beef Meat Pie sounded awesome but after talking it up they left off the hot giardiniera that would have made the meal memorable. I called and complained and got a few bucks off of another order so next time we ordered a deep dish pizza. Their pizza wasn't all that memorable and we haven't been back.
Itzza Pizza,"12"" gluten-free crust pizza","Itzza Pizza is the replacement for Gumby's on Madison's near west side

I had the chicago style stuffed pizza and it was good (very big!), but nothing like authentic gino's east or lou malnati's in chicago. The sauce, crust, cheese, and toppings were pretty average and what you would find at places like pizza di roma or glass nickel, at a little cheaper price.

The one thing this place has that no one else does: PEPPERONI ROLLS. Gumby's had them and they were the best and these are even better!! They're soft, chewy, and come with a side of what tasted like thousand island dressing with a kick. Very awesome.

I would rank this place average in every single quality: taste, presentation, location, delivery speed. But the pepperoni rolls won me over. Definitely worth a try."

The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"Ordered takeout* from The Brass Ring tonight, since I had won a gift card at work. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Taking into account the fact that it was takeout, and the food stewed in a styro box for about 5 minutes I would have this to say:
Meh
Yeah, just meh. It seems like the place must use about 90% pre-prepared Sysco products. From past experience ordering appetizers here while playing pool along with this experience, it's just a mediocre culinary tour de meh. Here's my anal-retentive breakdown of the burger. 
My desired medium-rare burger patty was a few degrees past medium-well done and didn't even taste as if it were salted. It was dwarfed by the bun, and the bun wasn't big - literally a 2/3"" circle of bun was viable ringing the entire burger...not cool. The tomato was super ripe and fresh, as was the onion. The pickle spear was cold and crispy, not bad. The lettuce wasn't brown, but it was pretty well past its prime, but I ate it so it wasn't unserviceable. 
This was a ""fancy"" burger so it also had a couple small onion rings on it (tasty, but you really can't mess up an onion ring unless you forget to cook it) and chipotle BBQ sauce. The sauce was actually pretty good, a little bit of heat, and not overly burdened with sugar. Pretty sure it was made in house from pre-made bottles of other sauces. The bun wasn't stale, but it was crispy, like they tried to toast it up in an oven but left it in 3 minutes too long. Average style cheddar cheese also made an appearance. 
The fries were cooked damn near perfect and salted adequately. They even stayed a little crispy after 5 minutes in styrofoam, I suspect witchcraft. 
The whole thing came with utensils, condents and napkins without even asking. Big plus. 
I'll happy spend the remaining 12 bucks left on the gift card and eat there again. But with all the other food options within a 1mile radius of here, it might be a while till I return to try another burger. The fries though...

*This review is for the food only. From experience I can say that the bartenders are friendly, the amenities above average, and the overall atmosphere of the place is very nice."
The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"I've been to The Brass Ring a number of times to play pool, shuffleboard, and/or darts (all while drinking beer).  

But last night I went for my first ever trivia night and it was a lot of fun!
It was easy and the staff was so welcoming even though it was my first time joining in.  What's so great is that it is free to play, but you can win $40, $20, or $10 based off your score. If you want to have a fun night with your friends, I definitely recommend going Thursdays (starts at 7:30) or on Sunday (starts at 5:30).  

If you don't want to do trivia, that's ok!  The Brass Ring offers a million other activities that are fun to do sober or while sipping on your favorite adult beverage.  They also serve food and have tables throughout the building. 

It's also a great spot to start your night out if you plan on seeing a show at The High Noon.  It is located right next door! 

Usually I like more low-key places to hang out.  I find places that are large, and noisy to be a little overwhelming, but I've always had a great time when visiting.  

The only reason that  I am not giving 5 stars is that my friends and I ordered some nachos (twice...don't ask) last night and the cheese wasn't melted all the way.  We still ate all of them (twice), so it must not have been that bad.  Ha. :)"
The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"The only times I've come here is for after game drinks with my team (Madison Sports and Social club had a deal for a free pitcher after games), but it's always been a fun time! Good selection of draft beers, delicious cheese curds (probably some of the better ones in Madison), and a great, comfortable atmosphere. Sometimes the service can get a little sketchy when it's super busy, but we're just there to hang out, so we don't mind! Food is pretty acceptable too.

My friends have come for the pool, and they say it's fun--will need to try that sometime!"
The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"I had difficulty with picking between 3 or 4 stars. I gave 4 because our service that evening was superior. The waitress was so attentive to everything and so very nice. Myself, along with many others came out to the Brass Ring to watch the amazing Madison Radicals for their semi final game. They use wifi and apple TV for broadcasting - it kept freezing up, so that was quite annoying and disappointing. They did end up fixing things by the second half which we were happy about.
Myself and friends shared a pitcher of the Dirty Bastard, how could you not love it with a name like that!  It was a night creamy dark beer on tap. We ordered some cheese curds which were pretty good. They came with an option of 4 dipping sauces (I'd stick with ranch) we tried all 4. I ordered the Bleu Garlic Burger. I thought it was good, nice flavor - cooked how I requested. One complaint that I had was the water - I couldn't drink it.  It tasted like it was straight from a swimming pool - lots of chlorine. blech!
The atmosphere of the Brass Ring is nice, very nice large outdoor seating area too. I would come here again for some good beer on tap and good bar food."
The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"I was invited out to Brass Ring for a big birthday party for a friend of mine.  Dinner first, with about 12 other ladies, and then a bit of Reggae and Dancehall next door so said birthday woman could shake it like a polaroid picture.  

Last time I was in Brass Ring was about, geez...... 8 years ago?  I was heavy into playing pool in my 20's and Brass Ring has got some great pool tables.  4 stars just for that fact.  Madison isn't really known for any great pool halls... Cueniques was closed down due to mobs of people deciding they wanted to fight in the street at 2am.... and well..... not much to speak of has taken Cuenique's place...  But Brass Ring is low key.. Not many tables, but enough... 

Add some good food to the mix and I will keep Brass Ring on my playlist.  While out with me ladies I ordered the Bourbon Street Salmon Salad, which boasts a 5 ounce Norwegian Salmon Filet grilled with a bourbon glaze and served on a bed of greens with parmesan cheese, onions, tomato & cucumber with a side of ""Texas Caviar.""  

Can I say Yum?..  I think I said Yum...   It was gooooooooood  

I've found myself a bit more of a homebody these days, especially in the winter - I tend to hibernate - so I passed up the dance party that ensued after dinner, but I witnessed the pictures and it looked like a great time.  

Like this place."
The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"This place was awful. I just left. This is my second trip to Madison and my friend took me here. It was a Sunday morning and the place was nearly empty. 

Something was wrong with their water...we could not drink it. We ordered soda waters and they tasted fine. But they charged for soda water (whaaaaaat?? I know) 
I ordered the smokestack and the soup of the day. The soup was extremely salty and the sandwich was this: lower bun , turkey, bacon, cheese, bun top. Zero effort to make a decent sandwich on their part. 

My friend had the salmon salad and said it was fine. My other friend had a grilled cheese and he couldn't eat it...he said it was too cheesy, which sounds like well duh you ordered a grilled cheese, but it was more the fact that it was just not well balanced so it just felt like biting a slab of melted cheese.

Bad, bad experience."
The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"A few co-workers and I met here last Friday to get together.  We all needed to blow off some steam about work and a bar seemed like the perfect place to do it.  It was fairly busy, since it was a Friday, but the waitress we had did a pretty good job of checking on us.  We were even checked on by who I believe to be a manager a couple times.  I ordered a couple well drinks and was pleasantly surprised by how good they tasted.  You can never be too sure with a well drink...
I ordered cheese curds to munch on and while they were good, they were not anything special.  My co-worker got the hummus wrap and she seemed to enjoy that a lot.  Pricing for everything seemed average.  No bargains, but you weren't going to pay an arm and a leg for basic bar food either.  I liked the atmosphere a lot, but I'm not sure if I'll make an effort to return."
The Brass Ring,cheddar cheese curds,"Why is it that whenever a new bar goes up in Madison they insist on making it feel like it belongs in Fitchburg? Other than that, it's not a bad spot to shoot some pool, grab some cheese curds and a pitcher to relax. It's over on East Wash in the sort of no-man's-land, which keeps the kiddies out. Not necessarily a destination, but a good spot to start off your evening."
The Brass Ring,side of french fries,"I've only been to the Brass Ring a few times, to play pool or to play trivia, but as pubs go, it's a nice one. The lighting level is good, not too bright or too dark, and it's very roomy and open inside while still retaining a sense of coziness, not an easy thing to pull off. 

The food is quite good, also. I'm kind of a BLT affectionata, and I really enjoyed my chipotle BLT with pub chips tonight. The bacon tasted freshly cooked, neither over or underdone, and was very flavorful. I usually don't like the bread to be grilled because of the heavy, greasy feel it gives to the sandwich, but Brass Ring grilled it in such a way that it was nicely crispy outside and not greasy at all. The chipotle mayo is served on the side and adds nice flavor and heat. The pub chips were a little burnt tasting, not the best I've had; the only off note. The dill pickle spear was on point, nicely garlicy and dilly, with no hint of sweetness. 

I paired it with a PsycHOPath tap beer (which was served in the correct glassware), and at $4 was a very good value. The tap beer list isn't huge, but has enough variety to keep most folks happy. (DC only drinks Budweiser, and of course they had that for him, so he was happy.) 

The service is the perfect balance of friendly and efficient, if only a wee bit slow. The trivia night was one of the better ones I've been to. We had a very good time, and will do it again soon."
The Brass Ring,side of french fries,"Ordered takeout* from The Brass Ring tonight, since I had won a gift card at work. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Taking into account the fact that it was takeout, and the food stewed in a styro box for about 5 minutes I would have this to say:
Meh
Yeah, just meh. It seems like the place must use about 90% pre-prepared Sysco products. From past experience ordering appetizers here while playing pool along with this experience, it's just a mediocre culinary tour de meh. Here's my anal-retentive breakdown of the burger. 
My desired medium-rare burger patty was a few degrees past medium-well done and didn't even taste as if it were salted. It was dwarfed by the bun, and the bun wasn't big - literally a 2/3"" circle of bun was viable ringing the entire burger...not cool. The tomato was super ripe and fresh, as was the onion. The pickle spear was cold and crispy, not bad. The lettuce wasn't brown, but it was pretty well past its prime, but I ate it so it wasn't unserviceable. 
This was a ""fancy"" burger so it also had a couple small onion rings on it (tasty, but you really can't mess up an onion ring unless you forget to cook it) and chipotle BBQ sauce. The sauce was actually pretty good, a little bit of heat, and not overly burdened with sugar. Pretty sure it was made in house from pre-made bottles of other sauces. The bun wasn't stale, but it was crispy, like they tried to toast it up in an oven but left it in 3 minutes too long. Average style cheddar cheese also made an appearance. 
The fries were cooked damn near perfect and salted adequately. They even stayed a little crispy after 5 minutes in styrofoam, I suspect witchcraft. 
The whole thing came with utensils, condents and napkins without even asking. Big plus. 
I'll happy spend the remaining 12 bucks left on the gift card and eat there again. But with all the other food options within a 1mile radius of here, it might be a while till I return to try another burger. The fries though...

*This review is for the food only. From experience I can say that the bartenders are friendly, the amenities above average, and the overall atmosphere of the place is very nice."
The Brass Ring,side of french fries,"Came for Friday fish fry. For $11.95 i got a basket of fries, coleslaw and tarter sauce which was awesome. But the cod, 3 pieces that were maybe bite size at best. Super small portions. Will not be back for Fish Fry. To much competition."
The Brass Ring,side of french fries,"I've been to the Brass Ring for everything from a drink to watching a game to dinner and it's been enjoyable all around. My last visit was for lunch and I went for my go-to sandwich, the Smokestacker. A pile of very thinly sliced smoked turkey + crispy bacon + provolone is a great start, but when you add the chipotle mayo you've got one of my favorite turkey sandwiches in town. Add to that some delicious fries (which I also recommend you put the mayo to use on) and you've got one happy lady.

I also want to give a shout-out to their BBQ pulled pork on a ciabatta roll that they had available during the Badger basketball final - if you see that come up as a special, it's a good choice if you want to mix it up from their regular menu.

The only snafu I've experienced with them was the night of the basketball final - there was a lot of confusion with saving seats and moving tables back and forth - but in the end it worked out more or less, albeit our group ending up at tables on opposite sides of the dining area. If I end up there for another big game, I'll just be sure to ask for a manager to see what the situation is when we get there to avoid confusion."
The Brass Ring,side of french fries,"I was invited out to Brass Ring for a big birthday party for a friend of mine.  Dinner first, with about 12 other ladies, and then a bit of Reggae and Dancehall next door so said birthday woman could shake it like a polaroid picture.  

Last time I was in Brass Ring was about, geez...... 8 years ago?  I was heavy into playing pool in my 20's and Brass Ring has got some great pool tables.  4 stars just for that fact.  Madison isn't really known for any great pool halls... Cueniques was closed down due to mobs of people deciding they wanted to fight in the street at 2am.... and well..... not much to speak of has taken Cuenique's place...  But Brass Ring is low key.. Not many tables, but enough... 

Add some good food to the mix and I will keep Brass Ring on my playlist.  While out with me ladies I ordered the Bourbon Street Salmon Salad, which boasts a 5 ounce Norwegian Salmon Filet grilled with a bourbon glaze and served on a bed of greens with parmesan cheese, onions, tomato & cucumber with a side of ""Texas Caviar.""  

Can I say Yum?..  I think I said Yum...   It was gooooooooood  

I've found myself a bit more of a homebody these days, especially in the winter - I tend to hibernate - so I passed up the dance party that ensued after dinner, but I witnessed the pictures and it looked like a great time.  

Like this place."
The Brass Ring,side of french fries,"I think I found a new favorite pub, and it might be brass ring.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon. We sat outside with the other Madison sports teams. We were served waters and beer quickly. I ordered the hummus wrap with fries on the side. That hummus wrap; I can write songs about that wrap. Savory crunchy healthy perfection. I was in love.

Environment was stellar. Space outside was open and inviting, and brass ring welcomed the dogs we had with us. One server even provided some water for my friend's dog, which was so appreciated.

The only criticism would be that the fries were too salty and many were burnt and unappetizing. I am however very willing to come back, and I plan on having that hummus wrap over and over."

Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"The Roman Candle is my favorite casual-Italian place in Madison.  The pizza is better than most in Madison, but it's the pasta and the lunch specials that make this place really shine for me.  My current favorite is their lasagna, and prior to that, it was their now-discontinued pesto lasagna, which was incredible.  Unfortunately their pasta selection is small, but what they do have is worth getting.

The pizza is, by my reckoning, better than any of the big-name delivery places in Madison (Falbo's, Figaro's, Glass Nickel, etc.).  It's the only one that I'd consider good as a non-native Wisconsonite.  Cooking time has always been reasonable when I've had one (always eat-in), and they've all been tasty.  The Vegan Destroyer is worth a call-out; it was highly satisfactory to both my vegan sister and me, and I'm not even vegetarian.

The lunch specials are $7.99 on weekdays for a choice of two among a pasta, a slice of pizza (you get a big slice with these), a salad, or their red pepper soup, plus a fountain drink.  I'm not a salad person, but they have some pretty good salads, and the red pepper soup is fantastic.  Pretty reasonable, and fairly quick too.

In my experience, the service, while not perfect, is usually pretty decent (I usually eat at the Middleton one, less often Fitchburg).  The only issue I've had is when one pizza came out slightly burned.  They admitted it, made another one, and that one came out just right.  I can't remember anymore if they adjusted the bill or anything because of it, but I figure they're close to average in that sort of thing for the number of times I've visited."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"If my experience was carry out only then I would have left 4 stars but alas my review reflects the in-restaurant dining experience as much as the food. 

""4 stars"" worthy: light, thin hand tossed crust that is just as delicious as the house sauce and fresh toppings. Very enjoyable and appealing to all pizza lovers. Solid. 

""2 stars"" worthy: the service is abysmal, the servers do try but the training and oversight clearly lacks. And no, it was not busy, we were one of five tables on a Thursday night. Our server, Joey, bless his soul, didn't know the beers they carried and corrected himself twice. After he brought our food he came back to check on ""how we were doing"" 20 minutes later after we ate all but three slices of two pizzas we ordered. He never offered refills on water or soda, and each time someone at the table had to ask, even though the respective glass was empty."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"This one was a disappointment. I gave two stars because I felt the caption ""Meh. I've experienced better"" says it all. I came in here thinking Roman Candle, in the hierarchy of pizzerias in Madison would place below Pizza Bruta but above Glass Nickel. What I found was a mediocre pie, and in fact, not as good as Glass Nickel. I ordered the house salad, it was good, fresh, which is becoming a rarity in Madison. I am finding a lot of brown, slimy lettuce, even at the ""so called"" better restaurants. The dressing was a house balsamic. Nothing spectacular, standard fare, very common about ten years ago. There were two points of note, I felt the bacon was too much for the salad, and the dressing was thick, too thick for a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad didn't cost Roman Candle any points. My issue is with the pizza.

This is a case where perception met reality with a thud. First, I noticed that fresh basil is a topping at Roman Candle. I highly recommend that one adds this as a topping. This pizza needs basil. It also needs more cheese. I wouldn't say double cheese as the crust is not hearty enough to hold it, but certainly more than what was on mine. The lack of cheese exposes the sauce and its faults. First, for all the little legends on the menu, the fact that the cheese is from Wisconsin still does not point to a creamy, fresh tasting mozzarella. In fact, this was a dry tasteless cheese. The problem is when you have very little cheese and what there is, is tasteless, the sauce has to dominate. In this case, the sauce is exposed as bitter.

There are very few varietals of pizza that allow the sauce to be bitter. Pizza sauce should be sweet. It should be sweet and sassy, like a young playful girl. It should not be bitter. The sauce should peek above the cheese to touch the crust. That part is a pleasure to eat or should be, if it existed. Its where the bare sauce is cooked onto the crust. No such on this pizza.

The biggest let down were the meats. The menu says ""artisinal pepperoni."" If you say artisinal, I immediately think like Osteria Mozza in LA or Eataly in NYC. In Madison, artisinal clearly means anything not by Oscar Meyer. This is not artisinal. Its not pepperoni where you can taste the fressh pork, and the seasonings. The sausage falls victim to the same inability to impress. I guess if its not Johnson Brothers, it is gourmet.

Roman Candle is an average pizza. Nothing special, not really worth the effort to visit. If you do go, I recommend extra cheese and fresh basil. The rest is in your hands."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"Pizza not that great; sometimes burned; and the salad  not fresh, and looks old; dry, and the service is really bad; either the real server is out and not at work yet,  and when you find someone, she won't take the order as she is doing something else, and so I should wait for this supposedly real server, or  they chat in one corner, and takes a long time for someone to come to your table;   it is highly chaotic- am not going back there. Odd service; it;s a good place for kids, I guess. They need to replace this place with professional people; or who really enjoys working there."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"The pizza is some of the best around, easily beating out every other pizza joint in town. I would classify this in the ""pizza parlor"" sense, which is classy, nice ambiance, not too greasy, and has the right amount of Italian feel, as opposed to a ""pizza chain,"" which is so greasy that you could douse an empty cardboard box of said pizza from craptastic pizza chain in water and discern no difference from before. Bad pizza joints also have a limited menu, with few salads and *shudder* bad breadsticks (which is, of course, a mortal sin). Roman Candle fulfilled all of the ""pizza parlor"" requirements, with really good oregano breadsticks, amazing salad, especially for the price of said salad, at something like four dollars for a well-sized bowl of leaves with creamy dressing, and of course, a huge selection of pizza. They give you a choice of sauce, and have almost fifteen toppings (not that anyone's counting or anything). Also, they have wine, which I found a little surprising. A good surprising, but a surprising nonetheless. I mean, it is a pizza place after all. 
There is a bottom floor with a playpen for the little kids, so that was mostly a family zone. The service was really good, our server came and checked on us about three-quarters through our meal, which was a little late, but it was extremely busy on a Friday night, so I don't blame her. She was really courteous, asking if anyone needed any refills, take-out boxes, things like that. 
The best thing about Roman Candle? The pizza of course, but I love the ambiance, really cozy even though it's a very open place. 
And imagine my elation when I found out that Roman Candle is adding a location near my house! Let's hope it's as frenfillaboulos as this one."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"Roman Candle has yet to knock my socks off. I've been there a handful of times now and have never been wowed. 

The pizza is good, but not great. Their house salad is slightly above par. The $7 lunch special for a soda/soup or salad/slice of pizza is a good deal. It's nice because you can just get soup/salad or two pieces of pizza. 

I'll go here if someone wants to go but won't go too far out of my way."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"My boyfriend and I recently moved from the near east side to Middleton, and since Roman Candle on Willy St. was a frequent of ours, we hoped the Middleton location would not disappoint.

Same great pizza, still a nice vibe--took one star off because  they don't have as much outdoor seating as the east side, and it's just not as open and light.

We like the House Salad(greens with tomato, cucumber, bacon, blue cheese and balsamic). It's so good. 

As far as pizza, the Pestoral(feta, artichoke, kalamata olives, roasted red pepper, and yes...pesto) and the Margherita(classic with roma tomato, basil and fresh mozzarella slices) are the BEST. My boyfriend does get a hankerin' for some meat on occasion, and their sausage mushroom is good too!"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"The pizza was great.  However, my husband's salad had WAY too much Italian dressing on it.  There was a pool of it at the bottom of the bowl.  Prices are a little high.  Customer Service was fine...just was surprised she couldn't tell me how much just a slice of pizza would be.  If it varies, give me a range or ask me what kind we were interested in.  We went with a whole pizza.  

The booths are horrible.  They lean back so if you are short, your feet don't touch the ground and you are touching the person across the booth from you.  Not comfortable at all!"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"I don't usually eat pizzas that much on my own because my work place caters them all the time for events and functions, but when I do, Roman Candle is one of the places I would go to. 

I love their pestoral pizza! Featuring Spring Green basil, house-blend cheese, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, Kalamata olives, fresh tomatoes and Wisconsin feta over pesto, all the yummy toppings on a pizza. 

The new hot-wa-ii is also awesome. It's similar to a hawaii pizze, but comes with Roman Candle's own Fireworks sauce (caution: spicy) and Pineapple-Chipotle drizzle.

Great variety of pizzas for hanging out with friends or snuggling in house for a movie, pizzas for every occasion ~~"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"Great pizza, and the Middleton location is just as good as the Willy Street. Probably better, because the layout allows sound to be absorbed rather that echo into jet engine volume. I love the PPPepperoni and the Carnivore, but both have enough meat and cholesterol to jumpstart a heart attack. The house salad is great too, with bacon!"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"We were in Madison for 5 nights...we ended up eating here twice because it was so good. We split the asparagus, the house salad, and the Supreme pizza with a gluten free crust and habanero drizzle. Also enjoyed a locally brewed smoked porter, and of course, some AMAZING ice cream.   We loved the little play area for our 2 year old, and our server was amazing on checking with us even though we were the only people down in the basement, and we took our time enjoying beers on a Friday night. The host the original night we went (just got some to go that night) was SO cool..brought out a coloring book for our daughter while we waited, and made awesome pizza recommendations. Really, really loved this place...please come to Denver!!! :)"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"It was my second time coming here while visiting the boyfriend's family in Wisconsin.  Both times we came as a large group, including 2 young children, so this is probably why service was pretty bad.  Quite slow and unattentive.  

I enjoyed the speciality pizza choices, and my Margharita with extra basil was good.  Everyone else liked theirs as well, and the house/garden salad looked delicious.  

The restaurant itself is set up on 3 pseudo levels.  The main entrance has several booths and the kitchen, down a couple stairs are a couple tables, and the lower level has more tables, a play area for kids, and bathrooms.  The evening we were there, 2 musicians played Christmas music, which was nice but made the main entrance a little crowded.

Overall, I'd love to come back with a smaller group - I'm guessing the service would improve."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"Great place to come for a casual meal in downtown Middleton. I like sitting near the large windows at the front with nice natural light. The booth seating is a little odd as it's quite high off the floor, and makes one prone to accidental footsie below the table. The decor is colorful and fun.

Pizza here is quite good- you can customize it or order one of their menu options. The salads have housemade dressings, and the ones I've tried were very good. The large salad really is quite big, the small was a decent size for a meal for me, especially if you're getting an appetizer. I have also had pasta here that was delicious. 

Nice staff here that's perfectly nice with midwestern charm."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"Roman Candle is our favorite place to go to for pizza and we travel 30 miles for a fix.  The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are very fresh. You may wait a little for a fresh made pie, but it is worth it!  I also love the house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The quality is very high and the price is reasonable for expensive ingredients, ( fresh mixed greens, blue cheese, bacon, cherry tomatoes). It helps stave off hunger if you're too hungry to wait for your pizza!"

Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"I'm rating this based on food quality only since my dad and I got delivery.

Basically, the pizza is ok. Maybe for a thin crust pizza in the Midwest it's something special, but it really is pretty average compared to any pizza you could get on the east coast. That's not to say it's bad, just that it isn't great.

Also, although the prices for just plain pizzas are alright, the prices for toppings are ludicrous. If you want something like chicken on your pizza it's something like an extra $4! Toppings are usually about $2 or less each so if you want to create your own pizza, be prepared to pay for it.

Overall, I gave Roman Candle 3 stars because of the average quality and the high price that you have to pay for it. If the toppings were cheaper, I would probably give 4 stars."

They give you a choice of sauce, and have almost fifteen toppings (not that anyone's counting or anything). Also, they have wine, which I found a little surprising. A good surprising, but a surprising nonetheless. I mean, it is a pizza place after all. 
There is a bottom floor with a playpen for the little kids, so that was mostly a family zone. The service was really good, our server came and checked on us about three-quarters through our meal, which was a little late, but it was extremely busy on a Friday night, so I don't blame her. She was really courteous, asking if anyone needed any refills, take-out boxes, things like that. 
The best thing about Roman Candle? The pizza of course, but I love the ambiance, really cozy even though it's a very open place. 
And imagine my elation when I found out that Roman Candle is adding a location near my house! Let's hope it's as frenfillaboulos as this one."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"Yum! Roman Candle is delicious!

Their red pepper and tomato soup is AMAZING! So flavorful and rich.

My two favorite pizzas are The Roman Candle (spicy sauce, Italian sausage, briny banana peppers) and the barbecue chicken (BBQ sauce, green peppers, red onion, tender chicken, and optional jalapeños).

I watched my beau devour a generous spinach salad that he really enjoyed.

Service has always been good. Attentive, but without making you feel rushed.

But seriously, get the soup!"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"The pizza was great.  However, my husband's salad had WAY too much Italian dressing on it.  There was a pool of it at the bottom of the bowl.  Prices are a little high.  Customer Service was fine...just was surprised she couldn't tell me how much just a slice of pizza would be.  If it varies, give me a range or ask me what kind we were interested in.  We went with a whole pizza.  

The booths are horrible.  They lean back so if you are short, your feet don't touch the ground and you are touching the person across the booth from you.  Not comfortable at all!"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"For anyone who says, doing half and half pizza sauces, as in half margherita and half banana peppers and sausage, is ""weak"", lemme tell you...they're making the pizza in the kitchen. They are under pressure, orders flying in from all different angles, take out here, order in there, medium with extra sundrieds, sub black olives for broccoli add pine nuts, extra sauce...it's no joke. So, that being said, they can't always split a pizza in half because the sauces just don't mix and they gotta cook it and prep and all that jazz.

So, is the pizza good? Yes, hands down, this pizza is really friggin' good. The BBQ chicken is wet my pants good. The Algo Malgo or whatever it is called is truly delicious. 

If you're looking for a quick lunch spot, get your ass in there and enjoy the pizza/salad lunch deal, for it will not disappoint. Order the cheese slice if you like, but since they have the dozens of toppings to choose from, live a little and put some meatballs or eggs or fresh artichokes and make it the way you dream it. 

OVERALL: One of the top pizza place in Madison or Middleton."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"Wow, I must say I'm super shocked at the excitement of the reviews about this place! I live nearby and and have tried Roman Candle multiple times, so I'd like to say I've given them a fair shot at winning my business. 

My most recent and last experience was the worst. The Caesar salad was a sad bowl of lettuce and croutons, for 8 bucks. The dressing, which had a nasty thick yellow slimy film on the top was anything but Caesar dressing.... my husband and I think it may have been deviled egg filling??? P.s. they forgot the anchovies! Really, how many ingredients go in a Caesar salad? 

On to the pizza, we had the margarita and Brad R. was right on the money.... not legit! They were out of basil (what Italian pizza joint runs out of basil?), the mozzarella was not fresh at all and the tomatoes were pale and yellowish. Don't even get me started on the over-sauced crust, the thin crust couldn't even hold up to it! This, along with the other pizzas I've had there in the past, where not good. 

Roman Candle, I really wanted to love you, but I'm tired of the disappointment!"
Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"It was my second time coming here while visiting the boyfriend's family in Wisconsin.  Both times we came as a large group, including 2 young children, so this is probably why service was pretty bad.  Quite slow and unattentive.  

I enjoyed the speciality pizza choices, and my Margharita with extra basil was good.  Everyone else liked theirs as well, and the house/garden salad looked delicious.  

The restaurant itself is set up on 3 pseudo levels.  The main entrance has several booths and the kitchen, down a couple stairs are a couple tables, and the lower level has more tables, a play area for kids, and bathrooms.  The evening we were there, 2 musicians played Christmas music, which was nice but made the main entrance a little crowded.

Overall, I'd love to come back with a smaller group - I'm guessing the service would improve."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"Great place to come for a casual meal in downtown Middleton. I like sitting near the large windows at the front with nice natural light. The booth seating is a little odd as it's quite high off the floor, and makes one prone to accidental footsie below the table. The decor is colorful and fun.

Pizza here is quite good- you can customize it or order one of their menu options. The salads have housemade dressings, and the ones I've tried were very good. The large salad really is quite big, the small was a decent size for a meal for me, especially if you're getting an appetizer. I have also had pasta here that was delicious. 

Nice staff here that's perfectly nice with midwestern charm."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garden salad,"The Roman Candle is my favorite casual-Italian place in Madison.  The pizza is better than most in Madison, but it's the pasta and the lunch specials that make this place really shine for me.  My current favorite is their lasagna, and prior to that, it was their now-discontinued pesto lasagna, which was incredible.  Unfortunately their pasta selection is small, but what they do have is worth getting.

The pizza is, by my reckoning, better than any of the big-name delivery places in Madison (Falbo's, Figaro's, Glass Nickel, etc.).  It's the only one that I'd consider good as a non-native Wisconsonite.  Cooking time has always been reasonable when I've had one (always eat-in), and they've all been tasty.  The Vegan Destroyer is worth a call-out; it was highly satisfactory to both my vegan sister and me, and I'm not even vegetarian.

The lunch specials are $7.99 on weekdays for a choice of two among a pasta, a slice of pizza (you get a big slice with these), a salad, or their red pepper soup, plus a fountain drink.  I'm not a salad person, but they have some pretty good salads, and the red pepper soup is fantastic.  Pretty reasonable, and fairly quick too.

In my experience, the service, while not perfect, is usually pretty decent (I usually eat at the Middleton one, less often Fitchburg).  The only issue I've had is when one pizza came out slightly burned.  They admitted it, made another one, and that one came out just right.  I can't remember anymore if they adjusted the bill or anything because of it, but I figure they're close to average in that sort of thing for the number of times I've visited."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garden salad,"This one was a disappointment. I gave two stars because I felt the caption ""Meh. I've experienced better"" says it all. I came in here thinking Roman Candle, in the hierarchy of pizzerias in Madison would place below Pizza Bruta but above Glass Nickel. What I found was a mediocre pie, and in fact, not as good as Glass Nickel. I ordered the house salad, it was good, fresh, which is becoming a rarity in Madison. I am finding a lot of brown, slimy lettuce, even at the ""so called"" better restaurants. The dressing was a house balsamic. Nothing spectacular, standard fare, very common about ten years ago. There were two points of note, I felt the bacon was too much for the salad, and the dressing was thick, too thick for a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad didn't cost Roman Candle any points. My issue is with the pizza.

This is a case where perception met reality with a thud. First, I noticed that fresh basil is a topping at Roman Candle. I highly recommend that one adds this as a topping. This pizza needs basil. It also needs more cheese. I wouldn't say double cheese as the crust is not hearty enough to hold it, but certainly more than what was on mine. The lack of cheese exposes the sauce and its faults. First, for all the little legends on the menu, the fact that the cheese is from Wisconsin still does not point to a creamy, fresh tasting mozzarella. In fact, this was a dry tasteless cheese. The problem is when you have very little cheese and what there is, is tasteless, the sauce has to dominate. In this case, the sauce is exposed as bitter.

There are very few varietals of pizza that allow the sauce to be bitter. Pizza sauce should be sweet. It should be sweet and sassy, like a young playful girl. It should not be bitter. The sauce should peek above the cheese to touch the crust. That part is a pleasure to eat or should be, if it existed. Its where the bare sauce is cooked onto the crust. No such on this pizza.

The biggest let down were the meats. The menu says ""artisinal pepperoni."" If you say artisinal, I immediately think like Osteria Mozza in LA or Eataly in NYC. In Madison, artisinal clearly means anything not by Oscar Meyer. This is not artisinal. Its not pepperoni where you can taste the fressh pork, and the seasonings. The sausage falls victim to the same inability to impress. I guess if its not Johnson Brothers, it is gourmet.

Roman Candle is an average pizza. Nothing special, not really worth the effort to visit. If you do go, I recommend extra cheese and fresh basil. The rest is in your hands."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garden salad,"Pizza not that great; sometimes burned; and the salad  not fresh, and looks old; dry, and the service is really bad; either the real server is out and not at work yet,  and when you find someone, she won't take the order as she is doing something else, and so I should wait for this supposedly real server, or  they chat in one corner, and takes a long time for someone to come to your table;   it is highly chaotic- am not going back there. Odd service; it;s a good place for kids, I guess. They need to replace this place with professional people; or who really enjoys working there."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garden salad,"The pizza is some of the best around, easily beating out every other pizza joint in town. I would classify this in the ""pizza parlor"" sense, which is classy, nice ambiance, not too greasy, and has the right amount of Italian feel, as opposed to a ""pizza chain,"" which is so greasy that you could douse an empty cardboard box of said pizza from craptastic pizza chain in water and discern no difference from before.

Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"After getting past the rude feeling at the door.  Headed to the bar to order a drink for both my wife and I.  Rude bartender slash not a ""beer drinker"" as she said when I asked if they had a certain beer, cover up for lack of knowledge, had my change thrown at me.  It must have been the drinks they mixed wrong behind the bar they were sipping on.  Needless to say taking your frustration out on your customers- bosses is not the way to keep your job.  As a manager for over 15 yrs you would have been fired on the spot. After over an hr wait finally got seated to a great waitress and a good meal. I had crab and handbatter shrimp which were both cooked well and came out hot.  Three others at the table had the fish fry and it seem like they enjoyed their food.  If it wasn't for the good service at the table I probably wouldn't return.  This is not the 1st time I have been here, just past 3 times haven't been the same as when they openned.  Good people are hard to find in the restaurant business, understandable, but they are the face of your business and  it should probably be taken in to consideration when hiring them.  Delaneys is just down the road and have had excellent service and food for not much more money.  Just saying!!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"Joey's does the most flaky, light, buttery, divine fish and chips I have ever had. Make sure to pay the extra dollar to upgrade to Alaskan Halibut, it is worth it. I have tried the specials on their menu several times with indifferent results, but the fish and chips will forever hold a special place in my stomach. The tartar sauce is also excellent, and they should charge money for the mini corn muffins with honey butter they serve at the beginning of every meal, because I would pay for those. 

Other good things: steamed mussels appetizer, if you are a fan of extremely potent garlic, butter and parmesan flavor; firecracker shrimp."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"A great find in western Madison from an East Coast visitor. Often I rely on Yelp when visiting a new town and the pressure is always on when it is to find a place for a group of out-of-towners to dine. Joey's was a successful selection that I look forward to visiting the next time I'm in Madison.

Being an East Coaster, there is always this assumption that you can't get good seafood if your aren't on a coast. (As if modern transportation and shipping doesn't exist, and ""Oh, hello, they ARE the GREAT lakes"".

For most of us, cheese curds were new, and everyone loved them. I had the chicken gumbo, absolutely the best gumbo I've had in a restaurant. It was what Campbell's thinks Chunky soup is, as opposed to most attempts at gumbo that are thicker than cream soup and burnt brown in taste and color. I very much wanted the battered fish (you can actually pick the type of fish!), but I needed to eat healthy, so I had the Citrus Mahi Mahi, you know, the fish so good they named it twice!

Since we were out late on a Monday night the restaurant wasn't overly crowded and we were able to be seated immediately, but it is so good I can see where reservations are required for more popular times. Despite the ""normal"" attendance the parking lot was packed. I couldn't imagine coming into this shopping center at peak times!

They also have a nice selection of microbrews, some on tap, some not. We appreciated the server's offer to provide small samples of beer so that we could make a selection."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"This is a fish fry review.

Joey's Seafood and Grill is a nice, down-to-earth place with enough class to bring a casual date. Decor is pleasant with reddish wood tables and chairs, neutral upholstered booths, a brick back wall and exposed duct work. The effect is as if you're in a homey, modern loft. There's no ""strip mall"" feel here.

I've been here three times. Once was with my brother, once alone and the once with 4 of my friends. They were doubtful when I told them how good it was, but believers after the food (and the bill!) was delivered.

The fish simply can't be beat -- I've been three times and quality has been identical each trip, which is very impressive to me. For $12.00, you get all-you-can-eat haddock with 2 sides of your choice and mini corn muffins with honey butter. The fish is so good you simply cannot improve upon it. The smooth batter is light in texture, golden in color and crisp to the tooth. The flesh of the fish is flaky, silken and tender. Just wonderful. There are many alternatives to the haddock including cod, lake perch and Alaskan halibut. For these, there are varying prices for the fish chose and if you would like two or three pieces. There is also a ""triple play"" option (my term) that gets you one haddock, one cod and one perch. 

Besides the fish, the other great thing about fish fry here is the accompaniments. You get two choices from a list of ten (ten!!), including vegetables, various potatoes, and even red beans and rice. My choices are the potato cakes and the slaw.

Sides are varied in quality, so spread things out and see what you like. The potato cakes are 100% a must-try. They are crisp outside and smooth inside, with rich flavor of potato, cheese, cream and onion so light it could be chive. That's a compliment. Slaw is a little heavily-dressed for my taste, yet still crisp. The flavor and seasoning is spot on. To me, red beans and rice is almost a stew of red beans poured over the rice. Here it is the type where the beans are incorporated into the rice; not to my liking but still well-spiced, with both a light heat and a good depth of flavor. I've crunched maybe one or two french fries and they're good. The only side I would advise against is the hush puppies. They are cornmeal based and I strongly prefer flour hush puppies. My friends found them to be fine, so your mileage may vary.

Service is great. Waitstaff and bartenders are cheery; almost playful. They seem to sincerely enjoy working here. All of them are well-dressed in solid black articles of their choice. 

As for cocktails, I've have a few Wisconsin old-fashioneds; two were sours, one was sweet. They were serviceable.

However, as I said, this is a fish fry review. The fish fry here is the best I've had in the area, with excellent waitstaff and serviceable cocktails. Quality has been steady across several visits. I recommend the fish fry at Joey's Seafood and Grill with no hesitation."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"Wonderful! We had the firecracker shrimp as an appetizer, I had the fish and shrimp for dinner and my husband had the lake perch. Everything had great flavor and were priced below what we expected. You are served warm fresh muffins to start and two sides with dinner entrees. A great local spot.....we will be back!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"I've been to Joey's three times now and I've decided that I really like this place. Last night we were looking for fish - and just didn't want fast food fish fry (Culvers or Red Lobster) and didn't want to go to a crowded supper club or fancy restaurant. Joey's was the perfect option. Don't let its location in the strip mall fool you, it has nice atmosphere and is a above average place to go with family or on a date. I tried the special - fish fry Walleye with two sides - vegetable medley and baked potato. The fish was excellent - although fried, it wasn't overly greasy. The sides were OK. I especially liked the mini corn-cake muffins they dropped off while we waited. Good service, decent prices, yummy food - I was very pleased. 

Maybe Arthur S. went on a bad night or something. There was a strong fried smell when I went to the bathroom, but we've only had good service and decent food. Third times a charm and I'll be going back again!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"Went to Joey's on May 25 for lunch; not too crowed at noon.  Had  fish tacos served with black beans and coleslaw.  Fish was battered, fried and tasted good, but served on a flour tortilla which became a soupy, gooey mess.  They should use warm corn tortillas.  The taco filling was fairly tasteless; pico de gallo could have used some spices.  Black beans were bland; no flavor, maybe out of the can. (I d suggest a side of black beans and rice instead).   Also, since the tacos are made with coleslaw and the included side dishes are not described on the menu for this item,  the side of coleslaw was redundant.  Boring beans, flour tortillas, bland pico de gallo, redundant coleslaw = BORING FOOD!  Waitress was nice though."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"Don't let the big fish tank and smiley waitresses fool you.  I was disappointed we ""tried something new"" by going to Joey's.  Either they should invest in a new set of smaller plates, or increase their portion sizes.  The presentation was sparse and unimpressive, and even if the meal had been good, we wouldn't have left feeling full.  I tried the scallops - it was like chewing erasers in a way-too-bitter cream sauce.

We won't be going back."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"My son asks to go to Joey's Seafood at least once a week.  It's his favorite restaurant. 
His favorite dish is the mussels, but he also loves the crab legs and kids fish fry.
Kids eat free on Sundays!
Here's what his mum likes about Joey's.  
Call ahead for your reservation so you can get right in without a wait.  Yes, it's in a strip mall but its conveniently located and once you are inside it doesn't feel like a strip mall place.  Love the corn muffins that arrive before your meal.  
Decent sized portions, options for appetizers, and so far all of the fish options have been delish.  There are a couple options for those who are not fish inclined.  
Service is always fast and friendly.  On my son's birthday our waitress went out of her way to make him a special ""birthday"" desert and a candle.  Can't ask for service better than that.
Like the boy said, he would go at least once a week if he could."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"Average. Ordinary. Not bad but not special, and prices are in the 15 to 25 average. Overcooked shrimp, salty crab legs, OK fish fry. Service OK. I have had a better meal at Red Lobster. Sides are ordinary. And not special either. Red beans are watery and seemed like from a can, not Louisiana style. Very limited tap beer selection. Some decent wine prices by the bottle, by the glass expensive. Nothing special on the wine list."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,I'm not sure I've ever taken part of an all you can eat crab legs so when I found out they had it on the night we were going I knew I had to get it. The nice part is if you get the all you can eat crab you can also get as much fish and shrimp as you want. I may have devoured 4 lbs of crab legs and 21 shrimp to myself. Not a bad deal for $33.50. There's also a $10 Bucky book coupon to make it an even better deal. The waiter was nice and definitely earned his tip (which they automatically add to the bill which I'm not a fan of) with all the running back and forth to fill our crab order. We ended up being there until closing and I didn't like the fact they must have been ready for us to leave because no one was in the restaurant part to say bye to our party. Overall a decent experience. Not sure id want to spend this kind of money all the time on dinner but for special occasions it's ok.
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mad town fish fry,"After a long wait to get seated (thank goodness for the interesting fish in the aquarium!), I found the food to be quite tasty but I really had to laugh when the waiter threatened to charge me for two more ""all-you-can-eat"" menu items when my son and I ran out of room and asked for doggie bags. Why would he do that? He said we hadn't eaten more than half the additional portion we ordered and therefore the ""all-you-can-eat"" part of the special was null & void. LOL! Haven't been back since."

We were here yesterday during happy hour and enjoyed the great drink and appetizer specials. Our waitress was great too!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"Mediocre at best.  Went on Wednesday when they advertise 2/1, however that was only cod and one other choice.  I had the perch and it was OK.  Two others had the coconut shrimp and it was so overcooked they could barely eat it.  Our waiter was awful.  I paid by debit card and when I got home I noticed he had also put the other 3 dinners on it as a pre-authorization.  When I called the restaurant the manager told me he possibly ""ran my card for another order by mistake"".  No apology, no nothing.  Just like it was the most normal thing in the world.  Wouldn't go back"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,Nothing special. They had a special for $3 old fashions which was a good deal. The food was kind of bland. I ordered the ahi tuna tacos and there was a lot of cabbage. The wasabi sauce was decent. Probably will not be going back here much. The mussels were decent at best. The best thing might have been the little cornbread muffins and honey butter they bring out pre-meal.
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"I have been here many times over the years-- with friends, family, on dates, and with my wife.  I have lived on the east coast, near the gulf, and visited the west coast many times.  My wife is an east coast transplant.  We know good seafood.  In the past we've happily come here.  It hasnt been the same as what we've eaten near the ocean, but is as good as you would expect in the midwest.

I visited on Monday, December 22nd, 2014, with a friend.  Between the two of us we ordered appetizers, entrees, and extra sides.  The food was so sub par we couldnt believe it.  Our appetizers were so bland that, before we got our entrees, we made sure to ask the server for extra seasoning.  Even with that they still tasted completely unseasoned at all.  I ordered cajun shrimp.  How in the world you have cajun shrimp with no seasoning on it whatsoever I have no idea.

Our bill came to over $60.  I paid it, but I almost regret doing so.  My friend said he had better seafood at Long John Silvers and I couldnt disagree.

I dont know if they changed chefs, or what, but I wont be going back."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"Have you ever had such a good dinner you feel goosebumps of pleasure?

Well, this was one of those moments. I placed an order for takeout and it was the Malibu Coconut shrimp with steamed broccoli and a baked potato. The shrimp was breaded with such perfection I could hear the crunch of those wonderful coconut flakes so clear in my ear....mmmm..I love that sound.....veggies were simple, but do not get confused, if they are not treated with care they just end up in a funeral home inside your mouth. Luckily, these two were alive and right on point. My hubby had the firecracker shrimp with the same sides I had and his shrimp was lovely too, it also comes breaded but in this case with a sweet and spicy glaze mixed with a hint of mayo. Ah! I almost forgot, they have a nice cajun ranch dressing you shoud try, it goes really well with the breaded shrimp ;)"

Decor is pleasant with reddish wood tables and chairs, neutral upholstered booths, a brick back wall and exposed duct work. The effect is as if you're in a homey, modern loft. There's no ""strip mall"" feel here.

I've been here three times. Once was with my brother, once alone and the once with 4 of my friends. They were doubtful when I told them how good it was, but believers after the food (and the bill!) was delivered.

The fish simply can't be beat -- I've been three times and quality has been identical each trip, which is very impressive to me. For $12.00, you get all-you-can-eat haddock with 2 sides of your choice and mini corn muffins with honey butter. The fish is so good you simply cannot improve upon it. The smooth batter is light in texture, golden in color and crisp to the tooth. The flesh of the fish is flaky, silken and tender. Just wonderful. There are many alternatives to the haddock including cod, lake perch and Alaskan halibut. For these, there are varying prices for the fish chose and if you would like two or three pieces. There is also a ""triple play"" option (my term) that gets you one haddock, one cod and one perch. 

Besides the fish, the other great thing about fish fry here is the accompaniments. You get two choices from a list of ten (ten!!), including vegetables, various potatoes, and even red beans and rice. My choices are the potato cakes and the slaw.

Sides are varied in quality, so spread things out and see what you like. The potato cakes are 100% a must-try. They are crisp outside and smooth inside, with rich flavor of potato, cheese, cream and onion so light it could be chive. That's a compliment. Slaw is a little heavily-dressed for my taste, yet still crisp. The flavor and seasoning is spot on. To me, red beans and rice is almost a stew of red beans poured over the rice. Here it is the type where the beans are incorporated into the rice; not to my liking but still well-spiced, with both a light heat and a good depth of flavor. I've crunched maybe one or two french fries and they're good. The only side I would advise against is the hush puppies. They are cornmeal based and I strongly prefer flour hush puppies. My friends found them to be fine, so your mileage may vary.

Service is great. Waitstaff and bartenders are cheery; almost playful. They seem to sincerely enjoy working here. All of them are well-dressed in solid black articles of their choice. 

As for cocktails, I've have a few Wisconsin old-fashioneds; two were sours, one was sweet. They were serviceable.

However, as I said, this is a fish fry review. The fish fry here is the best I've had in the area, with excellent waitstaff and serviceable cocktails. Quality has been steady across several visits. I recommend the fish fry at Joey's Seafood and Grill with no hesitation."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"Wonderful! We had the firecracker shrimp as an appetizer, I had the fish and shrimp for dinner and my husband had the lake perch. Everything had great flavor and were priced below what we expected. You are served warm fresh muffins to start and two sides with dinner entrees. A great local spot.....we will be back!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"My wife and I ate here last night, and it was a really good experience overall. We'd actually avoided it for some time because it looked very busy and I hate long waits. So, we arrived a little bit before 5pm on Saturday. We started out by talking to the owner about their website, which had a little problem with redirects from their mobile site going to incorrect links off-site - hopefully they get that fixed soon. Otherwise, you have to type in the ""www"" on your smartphone to get at their online menus (ie., avoid the mobile site). Anyway, we ordered a shrimp cocktail appetizer, which was perfect. We also had a really terrific waitress (can't remember her name), but she gave us some great food advice and was even able to tell us about some other seafood places in the area. The service here was excellent. The menu here was also really good - a pretty good variety of seafood and meat options, and not too ""foo-fooey"" for me.  The atmosphere was also very nice - not too loud, not too big, and very clean and modern. Great place to eat and have a decent conversation too. Our food came our pretty quickly, and was a good temperature. I had the shrimp trio, and everything was cooked very well and tasted great. If I had anything to gripe about at all, it's that I wish it would have been just a little more food. On the other hand, I was pretty hungry and I tend to eat more than most people, so for most people, it probably would have been just right. Still, that's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars...I wanted to give 4.5. Between the two of us, with an appetizer and beer, we spent $42, which I didn't think was bad for seafood. So, I'm a fan of this place, and we will definitely be back soon."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"Great food, great value, outstanding service!

This was really good food for the price, a great relaxing atmosphere and really just wonderful service. Our drinks NEVER went empty and our waiter was very personable and interactive, we loved him!.

The firecracker shrimp is REALLY good, it tastes like they have a sweet chili sauce on it and something else, they're really addictive and have just the right amount of kick, I would order at least two plates of these for appetizer with a group or just order the entree version for yourself. 

Their calamari is take it or leave it (it is thin-crusted, though, so that's a huge plus - just no distinctive flavor to it - maybe they should consider serving it with an aoili sauce?) so I would only order that if you're really craving calamari entirely on its own.

I wouldn't order their clam strips at all, it's just a pre-frozen dish fried (but nothing else we ordered was like this, so I overlooked that). 

The crab we ordered was warm, with fresh butter warmed on your table. I love that they have fresh ground pepper and sea salt at the table for you, in addition to the normal condiments of malt vinegar, seafood seasoning and anything else you'd need. They also serve you cornbread muffins with honeybutter which is NOM NOM NOM.

Their crab cakes are fantastic - they have a kick to them and the sauce they serve with it is just as good. DH would have eaten mine entirely if I hadn't stopped him.

I'm not a fan of cocktail sauces typically, but I LOVED theirs, it's the right balance of basically everything. 

The outside of the place is a little offputting, but just look past that because you don't notice it once you're inside and enjoying your meal. 

They have great local brews on tap, as well as other selections in the bottle, plus their happy hour specials are FANTASTIC.

We're definitely making this one of our frequent places."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"I like Joey's. It's local. They know how to clean the crab before serving. They offer Midday a/k/a Happy Hour pricing and it's a clean establishment. From the front door to the restroom (Disclaimer: I've only patronized on Sundays). 



My crab  wasn't overcooked and old like it had been sitting in water all night. Nope! 

I love kids eat Free on Sundays which made Sundays our new go to for ""our time."" 
Service is decent enough that they leave you alone and appear when needed. I don't care for servers that ask to refill my drink - just do it. I did when I served tables. 

Anywhoo, grilled shrimp was decent but I have to admit the sides are great and I DON'T LIKE VEGETABLES! The mixed vegetables are seasoned well....not only for  a Wisconsin location but especially for a white establishment. Yes! I said it. 

The mashed potatoes are seasoned well, too! I'm scared to ask if they use oil and butter because I don't want to give them up. The wild rice may be the box kind but it works for me to mix in with the veggies. 

The kid burger....Oh My! the bun was toasted well. Meat cooked to the right temperature. No American cheese - they use Cheddar. Good time every time. 

The fire cracker shrimp were good. Nice sauce on the shrimp and the dip is okay. I say okay because I think it's mayo based and I'm allergic.

My point: I'd love to go for AYCE Crab legs but can't justify $30. I understand they are locally owned so I can't get the Casino Buffet price so we will have a group outing here. It would be the best if they offered mustard/collard greens to go with those sweet corn muffins (I suspect Jiffy Mix). The honey butter is THE BOMB!!!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"Pleasantly surprised and pleased with Joey's.    We were a little unsure of what to expect due to some negative reviews.   Stopped by for the first time and ordered takeout.   The place was very busy, a good sign.   The dishes on the tables looked delicious.  The staff seems happy and were pleasant, upbeat, talking casually with customers at the bar and also quick to break away and serve me.   The atmosphere is nice but could really use a larger space.   It's crowded.  But still it is neat and clean and everyone looks sharp and is in uniform.
The food came quickly.   When we got home, we dug in and boy was it good.   Two types of shrimp and calamari.   All tasted as good as it looked.   The sauces were very good too.   The potatoes were excellent, the coleslaw was good and made like we like it.  The hush puppies were a little dry but tasted good.   The rice and beans were nicely done and very good too.   
We are looking forward to going back for a sit down meal.   Thanks Joey's for a great set of food good portions and a fair price.  5 stars on flavor and service. 4 on atmosphere and presentation."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,"Average. Ordinary. Not bad but not special, and prices are in the 15 to 25 average. Overcooked shrimp, salty crab legs, OK fish fry. Service OK. I have had a better meal at Red Lobster. Sides are ordinary. And not special either. Red beans are watery and seemed like from a can, not Louisiana style. Very limited tap beer selection. Some decent wine prices by the bottle, by the glass expensive. Nothing special on the wine list."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,I'm not sure I've ever taken part of an all you can eat crab legs so when I found out they had it on the night we were going I knew I had to get it. The nice part is if you get the all you can eat crab you can also get as much fish and shrimp as you want. I may have devoured 4 lbs of crab legs and 21 shrimp to myself. Not a bad deal for $33.50. There's also a $10 Bucky book coupon to make it an even better deal. The waiter was nice and definitely earned his tip (which they automatically add to the bill which I'm not a fan of) with all the running back and forth to fill our crab order. We ended up being there until closing and I didn't like the fact they must have been ready for us to leave because no one was in the restaurant part to say bye to our party. Overall a decent experience. Not sure id want to spend this kind of money all the time on dinner but for special occasions it's ok.
Joey's Seafood & Grill,honey lemon grilled shrimp salad,A fantastic all you can eat seafood bonanza. Our group of 6 enjoyed just about everything. I enjoyed four of the eight varieties of shrimp - the coconut shrimp and firecracker were my favorite.   Our table mates also enjoyed the all you can eat crab legs and fish fillets. The two for one margaritas also were a huge hit. Tuesdays are the best nights by FAR!
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mini cornbread muffins,"Joey's does the most flaky, light, buttery, divine fish and chips I have ever had. Make sure to pay the extra dollar to upgrade to Alaskan Halibut, it is worth it. I have tried the specials on their menu several times with indifferent results, but the fish and chips will forever hold a special place in my stomach. The tartar sauce is also excellent, and they should charge money for the mini corn muffins with honey butter they serve at the beginning of every meal, because I would pay for those. 

Other good things: steamed mussels appetizer, if you are a fan of extremely potent garlic, butter and parmesan flavor; firecracker shrimp."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mini cornbread muffins,"My family and I have been enjoying Joey's for a few years now. We always get their mussels appetizer, which is phenomenal. They also bring out a basket of warm mini cornbread cakes to the table with some honey butter. It is no longer on their menu but I always order the calamari tacos which if you ask for it they will still make them. We were here yesterday during happy hour and enjoyed the great drink and appetizer specials. Our waitress was great too!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mini cornbread muffins,Nothing special. They had a special for $3 old fashions which was a good deal. The food was kind of bland. I ordered the ahi tuna tacos and there was a lot of cabbage. The wasabi sauce was decent. Probably will not be going back here much. The mussels were decent at best. The best thing might have been the little cornbread muffins and honey butter they bring out pre-meal.
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mini cornbread muffins,I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to Joey's. Super cute restaurant and great service. They start with really yummy corn bread muffins and my mom and I each had a different kind of chowder - both were great! The entrees were generous and we both really liked ours. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try and I'm looking forward to going back again.

Joey's Seafood & Grill,mini cornbread muffins,"I've been to Joey's three times now and I've decided that I really like this place. Last night we were looking for fish - and just didn't want fast food fish fry (Culvers or Red Lobster) and didn't want to go to a crowded supper club or fancy restaurant. Joey's was the perfect option. Don't let its location in the strip mall fool you, it has nice atmosphere and is a above average place to go with family or on a date. I tried the special - fish fry Walleye with two sides - vegetable medley and baked potato. The fish was excellent - although fried, it wasn't overly greasy. The sides were OK. I especially liked the mini corn-cake muffins they dropped off while we waited. Good service, decent prices, yummy food - I was very pleased. 

Maybe Arthur S. went on a bad night or something. There was a strong fried smell when I went to the bathroom, but we've only had good service and decent food. Third times a charm and I'll be going back again!"
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mini cornbread muffins,"Excellent food every time we go. Starter muffins with sweet butter are outstanding.  My wife and I have our favorite dishes, but have not been disappointed when trying new ones.  Beer selection is good and service is always prompt.  Easily one of our top choices for lunch or dinner in Madison."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,mini cornbread muffins,"Never been disappointed. The corn bread muffins are great. Service is great, prices are fair."

Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Delicious, fresh General Tso's pan-Asian delight. A solid three stars. The place isn't very clean, but i've never had a problem with the food in nearly 10 years of drunk late-night food runs, mid-day lunch and glorious returns to Madison. Eat up and enjoy!"
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"I love that this place is such an eyesore.  They specialize in takeout, and the aesthetics of the restaurant itself say this, loudly.  The way the painful fluorescent lighting reflects off the bright yellow walls is almost genius in its awfulness.  

When I get that craving for Sesame tofu, I like that Asian Kitchen will make three meal's worth of it, in ten minutes or less, for under seven bucks, without sacrificing taste.  I have only had the tofu dishes, and that seems to be the prime choice here.  I haven't found tofu cooked this crispy anywhere else.  It's crammed into a Styrofoam carton with an appropriately massive amount of rice and a couple obligatory pieces of broccoli buried underneath everything else.  The broccoli is soggy, but I've had much worse, and I don't go to Asian Kitchen for the broccoli anyway.

It's an ugly little hole in the wall that provides wonderfully greasy food in ridiculous portions for cheap.  It may not be fine dining, but Asian Kitchen excels where it counts."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Got the Triple Green Delight one night early in my Madison stay, looking for a quick and cheap dinner. And it was quick and cheap ($7.10, I think). Order is broccoli, snap peas, and green beans over fried rice with a reasonably spicy sauce. It did not reinvent my concept of the possibilities for Chinese carryout, but neither did it let me down. The portions were big, the veggies seemed freshly cooked, and I was good to go. The store was not spotless, but neither did it fill me with fear. Although the three-star average for this business has been achieved by wildly divergent nostalgia trips and horror stories, between them they got the average of my experience just about right. You, Asian Kitchen, were A-OK to me, and were I hungry or drunk, a full-time resident of Madison, and in need of comfort, I just might have come knocking on your door a second time."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Asian Kitchen is definitely my go-to place for quick and cheap Chinese food - especially when those late night hunger pains creep up during exam time - or after nights of drunken debauchery - (they deliver until midnight most days and 3 am Thursday-Saturday!).   

General Tso's tofu is one of my favorites and the chicken version isn't bad either.  The chicken lo mein is super greasy but good nonetheless. The ""bubble tea"" drinks are, at most, okay. They're more like super sweetened fruit slushies.  

The food is cheap and come in huge portions. I usually get three servings out of whatever I order. The service is okay, could probably be better, but you get your food pretty quickly.  Overall all, I like AK - it's the epitome of what American Chinese take-out is - and enjoy it most in the comforts of College Library."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Asian Kitchen is probably the best delivery American-Chinese place Madison has to offer. While China A8 is nice and all and offers really, really nice deals for students--I personally find their food to be a little bland and that's why I mostly prefer Asian Kitchen.

I haven't experienced a whole lot from their menu--mostly either Orange Chicken or General Tso's Chicken. Both of the chicken dishes, when done right, offer a really, really sweet and slightly spicy taste. The General Tso's Chicken, in particular, has red pepper flakes in the sauce which adds a really nice kick. However, it always happens where you get overcooked chicken that makes it crunchy and almost impossible to eat--and as a result, I can't justify giving Asian Kitchen 4 stars.

When I've come to sit in at the restaurant, I have to be honest: it is the nastiest place. There is a lot of sticky tables and the bathrooms are horrendous; I've seen cockroaches and the toilets are almost never clean everytime I've been there. But that's why I typically only order from here for delivery. (I realize the cockroaches should bother me, but I'm adventurous and I'm going to assume they're going to get cooked if they land in my food anyways--more protein that way.)

It's great, cheap, and delicious--what more do you want from a Chinese restaurant?"
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"This is the best Chinese food I've had in Madison.  And their General's Tofu is one that I've been trying to find a match for in Normal, Il.  But no luck.

This place is great.  They're open really late (2AM, IIRC) and are priced just right.

Their menu has any and all Chinese food options at all hours of the night, which is great when you're stumbling home drunk on state street and decide you want Chow Mein.  It may not be the most authentic Chinese food, but it is fantastic food that I can't recomend enough.

It's always quick and courteous and the restaurant itself is very clean and bright.  Gotta love this place!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to continue my search for General's Tofu on par with Asian Kitchen."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Your dollar will not go farther in Madison than here. There was a period of negative of reviews that I cannot argue with...I came back about 2 years ago and expectations were not met. But those days are long gone! Asian Kitchen is back in its prime.

Lunch specials are the best deal possibly in the whole city. I highly recommend them. I always do pick-up (less hassle) and have never had any trouble with my order, items, or anything else. 

The portions are outstanding and they will cater to individual requests. General tso's too sweet? Ask for it extra spicy! They'll modify. 

They also seem to be adding more vegetables to many of the dishes and diversifying the offerings.

We had the Mongolian beef, General Tso's Tofu (spicy), and Moo Shu Pork - all I would recommend!"
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"*Let me preface this review with that I already stopped ordering from here in the past due to the taste, texture and quality of their food.

I decided to give Asian kitchen another chance again due to them offering cheaper/no fees on Grub Hub.*

Over the past few weeks I ordered twice:

First time, i was enjoying my night and I would have to say, the food was okay and timely... but nothing special, it was just filling on a late night after being out.

Second time, which was just this past Sunday, I decided to order my standard order of crab rangoon and General Tso's chicken or tofu. I immediately noticed the rangoon were either refried and old or overfried, but definitely off. Next I moved on to the General Tso's tofu, it was squishy and slimey per usual and most of it got thrown out. Needless to say, it was not filling or appetizing. 

What I didn't expect was to wake mid way through the night with wrenching pain in my gut. From that moment on, I was visiting the restroom at least every 2 hrs. This lasted for the next 12 hrs. I assumed it was food poisoning and just worked to get out of my system anything I ate, the last thing being Asian Kitchen! But I was sure that since I had nothing to eat for hours before Asian kitchen, it was the catalyst of my bathroom trips.

Overall, I will forever avoid this restaurant because every time you order with Asian kitchen you are playing roulette with a bout of food poisoning. I guess if your wasted, the alcohol may kill off any bacteria in their old, slimey, refried food. You've been warned."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"I like to think of this place as a secret lunch weapon.

It's small, grubby, and not very visible from the street. 

The food is really great, and they are unbelievably quick about preparing it. Bonus points for using liberal amounts of hot pepper in spicy dishes when requested. I can take it!

Extremely inexpensive, too."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"When I am in the mood for cheap, delivery asian cuisine, this is where I turn to...
Now, I haven't tried much on the menu... The vegetable lo mein was very boring, as were their eggrolls but the General Tso's tofu... fricken brilliant!  We ordered that the first time we tried Asian Kitchen and have not strayed from that dish yet.  It is about $7 and enough to feed my bf and I, and we can really put down some food.
Hopefully I will get the balls to try something else soon, but this dish is so darn good!"
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"When Jackie and Leilei owned this place Asian Kitchen rocked my socks off. Now it's just OK. Fortunately, they still make a mean General Tso's Tofu, I must say.

Also, the full entrees are gigantic for the price. Highly recommended if you're going to pay for a Dinner Combo--just make the upgrade, it's worth the extra pound of food you get."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Some of the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted.

The low prices, large portions, and late hours have always been extremely attractive to me (mostly the inebriated, 2 am me), but after probably 10 trips to this establishment, I've finally called it quits.

While I've never experienced the bouts of food borne illness that some of my fellow yelpers have alluded to, I do agree that this place is FAR from clean. If you're going to order from here, you should make it delivery--at least then you don't have to look at the filth while you're waiting to receive your food. If you DO order delivery, make sure to check your order BEFORE the delivery guy leaves. On more than one occasion, I've received the wrong order and the delivery person had sped off before I had even opened the bag (or given him a tip!)

Things I've tried from here: 

EGG ROLL: dry and flavorless, and the only filling inside of it is shredded cabbage (how can cabbage be so dry????)

ORANGE CHICKEN: over-breaded, overly sweet, dry, and of terrible quality. If you cut into the pieces, the brown chicken on the inside is revealed

CRAB RANGOON: DRY, little to no crab flavor (certainly no pieces of crab....I'm convinced that it's just plain cream cheese inside and they're betting on the placebo effect creating some sort of crabby undertone)

GENERAL TSO'S TOFU: rubbery, overly sweet...just don't do it...it's so bad

FRIED RICE: hands down the WORST fried rice I've ever tasted in my entire life....I don't even think they fry it...it's (you guessed it) DRY, hard, there's no trace of egg in it at all, and it mostly just tastes like white rice that has been lightly coated in soy sauce. SERIOUSLY DO NOT GO THERE. DON""T GET THE FRIED RICE IT'S SO BAD I CAN'T STRESS IT ENOUGH

POTSTICKERS (STEAMED): they actually taste really freaking good....but the meat inside is questionable at best


All of that said, I have a good feeling that this place will continue to be a late-night staple for the foreseeable future, but I'm telling you: if you're looking for GOOD chinese food (perhaps for a girl's/guy's night in, movie marathon, late night study sesh, or literally any other occasion), STEER CLEAR OF ASIAN KITCHEN!!!!

My best Chinese food recommendation: FUGU Asian fusion on Gilman street. That place is BOMB."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"It's like this - This place is not the type of place that you want to see. You don't want to know that your food is coming from somewhere this sticky and dirty. 

But, I have yet to find General Tso's tofu that is half as delicious as the one they have there. It's SO good. Also, the vegetables are always crisp and fresh, and you can tell they made your food right before they brought it to you. The egg rolls are pretty tasty too. Basically, it's really good American Chinese food.

Now if it the place wasn't such a disaster..."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,This place has blown me away consistently with some of it food. I love the bok choy dishes with either chicken or beef. I also love the beef lo mein. Ask for it spicy and it makes it even better. There also have yummy garlic wings and the king pao chicken is top notch. It is disappointing to eat chinese food from other take our places after eating here.
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Asian Kitchen is by and large the most dominant Chinese food restaurant in Madison. And with good reason. It's cheap, it's fast, the portions are massive (it always takes me two sittings to finish an order, and I'm a big eater), and most importantly, the food is amazingly good. Any time I want Chinese food, I always order Asian Kitchen.

But being the undisputed king of Madison Chinese has its setbacks for the customer as well. Asian Kitchen knows that their food is as addictive as crack, and that you'll always come back no matter what they do to you. On several occasions, I have ordered my beloved Mongolian Beef or General Tso's Chicken only to find that the meat was so dry that half the food was inedible. And if it weren't for this, Asian Kitchen would easily take all 5 stars for me. But unfortunately, ordering and actually getting the great food they're so famous for is increasingly becoming a shot in the dark."
Asian Kitchen,72b. spicy general tso's tofu,"Checked out this restaurant for my first time this Wednesday evening. I was surprised to see that they are open late so I did some take out around 9pm. 

Two things that need to be emphasized... 

#1 Unbeatable price for the amount of food. 
#2 Below average quality. 

$7.60 for a take out order of the General Tso's Chicken. That was about the only positive part. The chicken wasn't very warm which made me question if it was made to order. No consistency with the chicken... some dry and crispy...some mushy and soggy. 

Overall feeling--- not bad. I guess I can't be too picky when spending seven bucks for Wednesday evening take out."
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"Delicious, fresh General Tso's pan-Asian delight. A solid three stars. The place isn't very clean, but i've never had a problem with the food in nearly 10 years of drunk late-night food runs, mid-day lunch and glorious returns to Madison. Eat up and enjoy!"
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"I love that this place is such an eyesore.  They specialize in takeout, and the aesthetics of the restaurant itself say this, loudly.  The way the painful fluorescent lighting reflects off the bright yellow walls is almost genius in its awfulness.  

When I get that craving for Sesame tofu, I like that Asian Kitchen will make three meal's worth of it, in ten minutes or less, for under seven bucks, without sacrificing taste.  I have only had the tofu dishes, and that seems to be the prime choice here.  I haven't found tofu cooked this crispy anywhere else.  It's crammed into a Styrofoam carton with an appropriately massive amount of rice and a couple obligatory pieces of broccoli buried underneath everything else.  The broccoli is soggy, but I've had much worse, and I don't go to Asian Kitchen for the broccoli anyway.

It's an ugly little hole in the wall that provides wonderfully greasy food in ridiculous portions for cheap.  It may not be fine dining, but Asian Kitchen excels where it counts."
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"The food isn't great, but the lunch deal is a really good deal and it is significantly cheaper than fugu. The late night hours on the weekend are just amazing. I've had drunk late night meals from there often."
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"Asian Kitchen is definitely my go-to place for quick and cheap Chinese food - especially when those late night hunger pains creep up during exam time - or after nights of drunken debauchery - (they deliver until midnight most days and 3 am Thursday-Saturday!).   

General Tso's tofu is one of my favorites and the chicken version isn't bad either.  The chicken lo mein is super greasy but good nonetheless. The ""bubble tea"" drinks are, at most, okay. They're more like super sweetened fruit slushies.  

The food is cheap and come in huge portions. I usually get three servings out of whatever I order. The service is okay, could probably be better, but you get your food pretty quickly.  Overall all, I like AK - it's the epitome of what American Chinese take-out is - and enjoy it most in the comforts of College Library."
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"I was in Milwaukee for work and did not want to go far from the hotel due to the bitter cold.  I saw this place on yelp and decided to check it out.  I ordered from their nicely priced lunch menu.  I ordered the shrimp egg foo young and shrimp noodle soup.  I didn't wait long for my order.  I guess because I was the only person in the restaurant.  They do offer delivery but I wanted to get my steps in.  The food was still hot even after my short cold walk back to the hotel.  Everything was tasty.  However, the gravy for the egg foo young was different.  It had more of a BBQ sauce taste & consistency.  Very different from what I am accustomed but still very good and filling.  I would try it again but eat the soup while it was still hot."
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"Asian Kitchen is probably the best delivery American-Chinese place Madison has to offer. While China A8 is nice and all and offers really, really nice deals for students--I personally find their food to be a little bland and that's why I mostly prefer Asian Kitchen.

I haven't experienced a whole lot from their menu--mostly either Orange Chicken or General Tso's Chicken. Both of the chicken dishes, when done right, offer a really, really sweet and slightly spicy taste. The General Tso's Chicken, in particular, has red pepper flakes in the sauce which adds a really nice kick. However, it always happens where you get overcooked chicken that makes it crunchy and almost impossible to eat--and as a result, I can't justify giving Asian Kitchen 4 stars.

When I've come to sit in at the restaurant, I have to be honest: it is the nastiest place. There is a lot of sticky tables and the bathrooms are horrendous; I've seen cockroaches and the toilets are almost never clean everytime I've been there. But that's why I typically only order from here for delivery. (I realize the cockroaches should bother me, but I'm adventurous and I'm going to assume they're going to get cooked if they land in my food anyways--more protein that way.)

It's great, cheap, and delicious--what more do you want from a Chinese restaurant?"
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"This is the best Chinese food I've had in Madison.  And their General's Tofu is one that I've been trying to find a match for in Normal, Il.  But no luck.

This place is great.  They're open really late (2AM, IIRC) and are priced just right.

Their menu has any and all Chinese food options at all hours of the night, which is great when you're stumbling home drunk on state street and decide you want Chow Mein.  It may not be the most authentic Chinese food, but it is fantastic food that I can't recomend enough.

It's always quick and courteous and the restaurant itself is very clean and bright.  Gotta love this place!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to continue my search for General's Tofu on par with Asian Kitchen."
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"Your dollar will not go farther in Madison than here. There was a period of negative of reviews that I cannot argue with...I came back about 2 years ago and expectations were not met. But those days are long gone! Asian Kitchen is back in its prime.

Lunch specials are the best deal possibly in the whole city. I highly recommend them. I always do pick-up (less hassle) and have never had any trouble with my order, items, or anything else. 

The portions are outstanding and they will cater to individual requests. General tso's too sweet? Ask for it extra spicy! They'll modify. 

They also seem to be adding more vegetables to many of the dishes and diversifying the offerings.

We had the Mongolian beef, General Tso's Tofu (spicy), and Moo Shu Pork - all I would recommend!"
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"*Let me preface this review with that I already stopped ordering from here in the past due to the taste, texture and quality of their food.

I decided to give Asian kitchen another chance again due to them offering cheaper/no fees on Grub Hub.*

Over the past few weeks I ordered twice:

First time, i was enjoying my night and I would have to say, the food was okay and timely... but nothing special, it was just filling on a late night after being out.

Second time, which was just this past Sunday, I decided to order my standard order of crab rangoon and General Tso's chicken or tofu. I immediately noticed the rangoon were either refried and old or overfried, but definitely off. Next I moved on to the General Tso's tofu, it was squishy and slimey per usual and most of it got thrown out. Needless to say, it was not filling or appetizing. 

What I didn't expect was to wake mid way through the night with wrenching pain in my gut. From that moment on, I was visiting the restroom at least every 2 hrs. This lasted for the next 12 hrs. I assumed it was food poisoning and just worked to get out of my system anything I ate, the last thing being Asian Kitchen! But I was sure that since I had nothing to eat for hours before Asian kitchen, it was the catalyst of my bathroom trips.

Overall, I will forever avoid this restaurant because every time you order with Asian kitchen you are playing roulette with a bout of food poisoning. I guess if your wasted, the alcohol may kill off any bacteria in their old, slimey, refried food. You've been warned."
Asian Kitchen,l5. general tso's tofu lunch special,"I like to think of this place as a secret lunch weapon.

It's small, grubby, and not very visible from the street. 

The food is really great, and they are unbelievably quick about preparing it. Bonus points for using liberal amounts of hot pepper in spicy dishes when requested. I can take it!

Extremely inexpensive, too."

My personal favorite is to get the sesame chicken, and have a friend get the chicken with veggies. Then you kinda mix the two together so you get a little veggie, and a little sesame chicken. Your free ""sides"" include lots of fried or steamed rice AND a great egg roll. 

Its not health food by any stretch, but its less greasy than other places (the right amount of grease in my book)."

Asian Kitchen,l13. general tso's chicken lunch special,"""Healthy Diet Menu"" that ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD.

Chinese is my go-to meal after being out of town (which I am frequently) and I decided to try the less-greasy alternatives on Asian Kitchen's ""Healthy Diet Menu"" last night.

I was very pleased with what I got. Now mind you, it is food that does not have any oil, sugar, salt or added fats, so we're not talking the usual, rub-it-on-my-thighs-because-it's-going-to-end-up-there-anyway Chinese food experience. I ordered the Chicken and Broccoli and steamed dumplings. I've had the steamed dumplings before and they are fairly authentic steamed dumplings. A friend from China taught me to make them a few years ago, and they're pretty close to hers. The chicken and broccoli order was HUGE (it'll be AT LEAST two more meals) and looked gorgeous. A few carrots for color, and the brown sauce it comes with is just salty enough to punch it up, but not to give that salted-snail feeling that a lot of Chinese food seems to give me. They also give it to you on the side so seasoning is at your discretion.

I'll definitely be ordering again and again. Nice to have a late-night food option that isn't so calorie-dense."

All of that said, I have a good feeling that this place will continue to be a late-night staple for the foreseeable future, but I'm telling you: if you're looking for GOOD chinese food (perhaps for a girl's/guy's night in, movie marathon, late night study sesh, or literally any other occasion), STEER CLEAR OF ASIAN KITCHEN!!!!

My best Chinese food recommendation: FUGU Asian fusion on Gilman street. That place is BOMB."
Asian Kitchen,l13. general tso's chicken lunch special,"It's like this - This place is not the type of place that you want to see. You don't want to know that your food is coming from somewhere this sticky and dirty. 

But, I have yet to find General Tso's tofu that is half as delicious as the one they have there. It's SO good. Also, the vegetables are always crisp and fresh, and you can tell they made your food right before they brought it to you. The egg rolls are pretty tasty too. Basically, it's really good American Chinese food.

Now if it the place wasn't such a disaster..."
Asian Kitchen,l13. general tso's chicken lunch special,This place has blown me away consistently with some of it food. I love the bok choy dishes with either chicken or beef. I also love the beef lo mein. Ask for it spicy and it makes it even better. There also have yummy garlic wings and the king pao chicken is top notch. It is disappointing to eat chinese food from other take our places after eating here.
Asian Kitchen,l13. general tso's chicken lunch special,"Asian Kitchen is by and large the most dominant Chinese food restaurant in Madison. And with good reason. It's cheap, it's fast, the portions are massive (it always takes me two sittings to finish an order, and I'm a big eater), and most importantly, the food is amazingly good. Any time I want Chinese food, I always order Asian Kitchen.

But being the undisputed king of Madison Chinese has its setbacks for the customer as well. Asian Kitchen knows that their food is as addictive as crack, and that you'll always come back no matter what they do to you. On several occasions, I have ordered my beloved Mongolian Beef or General Tso's Chicken only to find that the meat was so dry that half the food was inedible. And if it weren't for this, Asian Kitchen would easily take all 5 stars for me. But unfortunately, ordering and actually getting the great food they're so famous for is increasingly becoming a shot in the dark."
Asian Kitchen,l13. general tso's chicken lunch special,"Checked out this restaurant for my first time this Wednesday evening. I was surprised to see that they are open late so I did some take out around 9pm. 

Two things that need to be emphasized... 

#1 Unbeatable price for the amount of food. 
#2 Below average quality. 

$7.60 for a take out order of the General Tso's Chicken. That was about the only positive part. The chicken wasn't very warm which made me question if it was made to order. No consistency with the chicken... some dry and crispy...some mushy and soggy. 

Overall feeling--- not bad. I guess I can't be too picky when spending seven bucks for Wednesday evening take out."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"It was all right.  The vegetable egg roll was great.  The fried rice was ok.  I had chicken lo mein and the noodles & vegetables were good, but the meat was yuck.  I'm not sure what it is... I think I should only order items that do NOT have meat in them when I go to restaurants, because I commonly end up unsatisfied with the meat and it ruins the whole meal.  The checken was bland, tasteless, kind of gummy and some pieces were extremely gristly.

The fortune cookies were the good kind :) and they gave my boyfriend real pancakes w/his order (moo shu pork I think?)  He seemed to like his quite a bit.

PS it was delivery, not eat-in, and the delivery time wasn't horrible, but not super great."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"Last 3 times Ive been there I've asked to make my chicken extra spicy. I literally say ""make it so spicy it hurts."" or ""the spiciest you can possibly make it."" it has never been spicy. I don't know if they just don't listen, care, or understand? 

Anyway, standard pretty average Midwest Chinese. Too expensive."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"Overall an average stop. The place looked clean, was well lit and the staff was very nice. 

Then portion of my meal was large enough for 2 people. There was so much chicken and about 10 pieces of broccoli. So if you like leftovers or can eat enormous amounts of food give it a shot. 

The fried rice was bland. This is one of my favorite parts of the meal and this was a let down. No egg, carrot, etc...  Just rice. Egg roll was average as well. 

If you're in the mood for Chinese and are nearby, stop in. Don't go too far to try it out though. They have indoor and outdoor seating."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"I live very nearby this restaurant, and when I moved into my apartment, I was so excited to have a Chinese place next door. I had high hopes, and they simply couldn't have fallen farther. I have ordered take out from here twice (well, they only have 1 table anyway), and it wins the award for worst Chinese food EVER. I had tofu mixed vegetables, which is my go-to. No. just no. The vegetables were not just mediocre quality, but clearly past their prime. I'm talking soggy, wilted, and literally, barely even edible. It was so bad, I couldn't even tolerate eating the rest of my meal. Again, in an attempt to force myself to like China Wok, I ordered from here a second, and final time, 2 weeks after. The food was still of poor quality.I had hoped it was an isolated incident, but the facts suggest otherwise. I am truly shocked there are so many positive reviews here.

In conclusion, poor quality food, questionable sanitation, very very limited seating. Please, China Wok, if you read this, take a look at what you're serving as Tofu Mixed Veggies, or it's only a matter of time before the health department will look for you!"
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"WORST HOT AND SOUR SOUP EVER.  
I complained and they said they would make me more soup.
Just like yesterday, they made a big batch, heated some for me and put in vegetables and meats.
They raised the price to $4.00, the quality decreased to horrible.  I won't go back there.
When I told them I wanted a fresh batch, they said we just made this.ars.
I will not go back to this hole in the wall dump.
See my other one-star review about this dive."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"The food is ok for Madison Chinese food (I say this because I do not think Madison has very good Chinese food overall).  It is cheap, we got three entrées and an order of crab rangoons for under $25."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"I ordered takeout from here tonight. Eh. It was just okay. I ordered the hot and sour soup, which was a bit thin and greasy but otherwise okay tasting. I also ordered the chicken and snow peas. In my experience, this dish is supposed to be chicken, snow peas, maybe a few carrot slices, and a clear-ish sauce. Instead it came drenched in a brown sauce and had a ton of carrots, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. Not what I expected, plus the snow peas were really overcooked and had no ""snap"" whatsoever. I probably won't be going back here. On the plus side, the prices are very good, and $10.74 bought enough food for two meals or more. The food was hot when I picked it up, and the cashier was cordial."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"The great thing about China Wok is it is exactly what you'd expect. It's your decent, standard Americanized Chinese fare. I've never had a bad experience; it's always the same. This place is close by me, so delivery is always super fast. Although the food is generally nothing special, the fried dumplings hold an especially, soft, doughy spot in my heart."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,Good Chinese at an affordable price. They have the best lunch combos and the food is usually ready for pickup in 10 minutes. My food is always hot and have yet had any complaints with consistency.  Not the best Chinese out there but for the price it's pretty solid!
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"this food sucks!  it was horrible!  fried rice included soy sauce and carrots only!  no flavor.  the chicken dishes had fat on the meat.  i called and told them it was horrible and that i would not come back and they said, okay.  i spent $46 dollars on food that was awful and i definitely will not go again."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"so, chinese food... i never care for it, but every once in a while, mr. bekee gets a hankerin', so i go along.

their vegetable moo shu was excellent. a great mix of fresh, crispy (when necessary) vegetables and egg, delivered with four pancakes (not flour tortillas, like some places try to pull), and yummy plum sauce. the vegetable spring roll was also a success, though a little over-greasy.

my dining companion had a three-meat and garlic sauce dish, which he said was delicious with dumplings and a pork egg roll. all were very tasty.

the best part was that the delivery took under 15 minutes! and we're over 2 miles away, as the car drives. i presume they'll become part of our lazy weekend agenda."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"I think I am always gonna find myself coming back to this place. It has the best crab Rangoon and the Seseme Chicken is unforgetable. There should be more places like this and if the building space was more attractive or bigger, I think it would be really successful unlike other resteraunts. Also, the delivery usually takes half an hour so I order 15 minutes earlier *hint hint*"
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"China Wok is my go-to delivery place for basic Chinese. 

When I just want some moderately priced food that will get here fast, fill my belly with warm and comforting Asiatic foodstuffs, this is who I turn to. I can't speak for its authenticity or service, but I can speak for how often I find myself hungry, cold, and ordering from China Wok's online delivery system. 

I don't generally care for Sweet & Sour anything. That's not real food!  Have you seen that toxic-waste colored, gelatinous red sauce?  That can't be good for you.  But on a friend's recommendation, I tried it from China Wok. It's delicious. Somehow the battered and fried chicken had not become soggy during delivery, and I found it was insanely addictive over pork fried rice. (I like their fried rice- not too greasy. But it seems to turn bitter when you re-heat it the next day.)

Decent dumplings, and my BF seems to enjoy the spare ribs, since those are the only two things he ever orders from there. The sauce that comes with those dumplings is pretty awesome I must say. I also enjoy the crab rangoons, though they are the very creamy kind with almost no actual crab meat. Ask me if I care. Because I don't. 

Really, I've probably had 75% of the menu by now, and nothing really sticks out as ""not good.""  Though once we tried the Teriyaki Chicken and found it to be pretty dry. Who knows if that is how it usually is, since we only tried it once. What business did we have ordering Japanese food from a Chinese place anyway?

They are reliable, fairly priced, good size portions, hot when it arrives, completely non-threatening Chinese. If I wanted authentic Chinese cuisine, I'd be going somewhere for dine-in, not carry out.  China Wok delivers, and makes my insides happy."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"Standard midwest Chinese food, fast delivery, good prices, and absolutely the best steamed dumplings in town (and I've tried most of them). They're twice the size of the dumplings anywhere else in town and have a nice bite of ginger. Honestly one whole star is for those - otherwise it's decent utility Chinese and I have no complaints, after 2 years of pretty routine ordering."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"It was pretty good for fast food Chinese, did take a long time for the order to be delievered though."
China Wok,l12. chicken with chinese vegetables,"You know how you see a picture of food at a restaurant, you order it, only to have what is put on your plate barely resemble what you saw in the picture?  Well, you don't have to worry about this at China Wok.  What you get as your meal looks even better than the pictures above their counter.

I've dined at this carry out Chinese location numerous times over the past 2 years.  My office is only a mile or so away and it makes for a quick meal.  I must say, I feel like something has changed in the past year.  When I used to go, I felt like no matter what I ordered, it all looked/tasted the same. (ie sauce, color, vegetables, etc)  But for the past year or so, my coworker and I marvel at how great the food looks when it comes from the kitchen.  We primarily dine in.  We're practically giving each other high-fives, because we feel like we just scored big.

And the flavor is just as good as it looks.  I just ate at another carryout Chinese location and the quality of food reminded me how great China Wok is, so I jumped out to right this review.

I regularly get Kung Pao Chicken or Mongolian Beef.  My coworker exclusively gets General Tso's Chicken (this thing always looks amazing!)

Value is always great...we can get both of our lunches, i usually add an egg roll (75 cents) and he usually gets a soda and it costs us around $12 for both of us.  Quantity of food is also great.

As you can tell, I highly recommend this place.  Given it's a carryout Chinese place, I really should give it 5 stars for overcoming such an obstacle!"

One thing my friend and I didn't know - so in Midwest (or in Madison only?) ""chow mein"" is not a noodle dish .... .  So make sure to order ""Lo mein"" if you want that noodle dish. Chow mein is chop suey. I swear it's not like that in California!"

Domino's Pizza,small build your own pizza,Always a fresh hot ZA! Accurate orders and super fast service! Always craving pizza from DOM! Keep it up! $7.99 3 topping large Monday through Thursday!!!
Domino's Pizza,small build your own pizza,Dominos is dominos. But when I walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. I had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after I ordered. This dominos is slow. Drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. Edit: our soda was flat. Seriously go get Ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one
Domino's Pizza,small build your own pizza,"This Domino's is a hit or miss location. 

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.... it's a chain but I'm one of the folks that actually liked the crust before this new & improved crust came along. I like their sauce even the seasoned beef (because Pizza Extreme doesn't season their beef anymore I really have to make do w/ DP's). 

This location is a crap shot. Somedays service is on point and they're about their business. Other days it's like, ""I don't own this place so I could give a care less. So what do you want? No, there are no specials. No, we don't make that. Yeah the banner out front may say one thing but I'm in person telling you another.""

Think Chicago the movie when Richard Gere explains to Rene Z. about Lucy Lui, the Pineapple Princess, of what her husband says when she (Lucy) catches him in the bed with two (2) ladies. ""Who you gone believe, baby? Me or your eyes!"" Now that's funny. 

This location is locally owned and operated. I appreciate meeting a really good manager some years back but again those days are nigh now the best info I can give is order online and you'll incur less issues."
Domino's Pizza,small build your own pizza,"The pizza isn't that bad, but the manager cries like a little baby elephant during move in and move out day in Madison.  What a dork.  Dude keeps getting all posse and threatening to tow people.  So, watch out for the dominoes parking authority."
Domino's Pizza,small build your own pizza,"CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!  I ordered my pizza at 11:35 am, did not arrive until 12:35 pm.  Where I work is downtown/campus area.  My co-worker and I ordered the artisan pizza with spinach, feta and onions.  I noticed on the Tracker (on the Dominos website) that the pizza had been sitting under Quality Check for more than 20 minutes.  I called and the girl who answered the phone gave me an uncomfortable laugh and stated they were 'busy' or words to that effect.  

When the pizza finally arrived, the guy showed up with a pile of pizzas including mine.  He didn't smile and just said 'have a nice day' in a very montone voice.  When I got back to my desk and opened the box...the pizza was stone cold folks!  Thank goodness the pizza was half priced or otherwise I would have been on the phone to whatever manager runs the place.  NOT HAPPY!

Dominos, you need to not only have your place properly staffed on a Friday, but definitely staffed properly when there are half priced specials going on!  You cannot allow pizzas to just sit there until the one, lone guy shows up and grabs a dozen pizzas trying to deliver all of them within a short period of time.  NOT GOOD BUSINESS!  Thumbs down Dominos.  There are too many other places around here who deliver in a timely fashion and offer a much better product.

I will NOT be ordering from this Dominos again.  You have lost mine and my co-workers future business and we will not hesitate to inform others (as this yelp review attests to) NOT to order from this establishment.

One ticked off middle-aged woman who just wanted to eat a pizza...geesh.

When I finally got my phone charged, I called said location and they got frustrated when I didn't have the exact location of the hotel and hung up on me. I called back and spoke to a different person and they finally told me the couldn't find my location and tried calling me. When I didn't answer, they straight up canceled my order. One would assume that it's not that hard to find the only high rise hotel on the entire street. I feel I was blown off and then blown off again when I called about my order an hour later.

They took the order and charged my credit card, they said it would take an hour. OK, so I could wait, it was snowing really heavy and I was busy so I gave them time. At the two hour mark I called and they said the driver was just at my address for a delivery, but they didnt have an order in the system for me. They tried to find the guy that took the order and they said he had clocked out and left. So all they could do was make a new pizza and send it out.

Last night my fiance and I ordered two pizza's for delivery through the Domino's app at roughly 7:35pm. While keeping tabs on the app, I found that the pizza remained at the ""quality check"" portion for more than a half hour. I decided to wait a few minutes, and roughly 10 minutes later the pizza's arrived an hour after being ordered. The delivery driver was deadpan and short, and the pizza was lukewarm at best. Normally delivery ordered from this location through the app comes in half the time, but I was willing to overlook that.

What I was not willing to overlook was the food poisoning that I had from the pizza. I woke up at 4 AM to stomach cramps, nausea, and even worse symptoms that I won't go into gory detail on here.

Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"This is one of those true Yelp success stories.

I grew up mostly in Madison but lived in Milwaukee for a number of years where Mexican food is ridiculously good.  Whether it be from one of the amazing restaurants on the Southside or the authentic Mexcian grocers (El Ray), you really can't go wrong.  Up until I went to Taqueria, I hadn't run into a restaurant in Madison that I would even deem ""acceptable"" for Mexican food.

There's a few places that were decent, but nothing that ever stuck out or that had all the right stuff put together.  Each place lacked either taste, proper pricing, or variety on their menu.

Well Taqueria Guadalajara solves that issue ten-fold in my opinion.  They are pretty much just what others describe here; a very very small mom & pop operation with a comfortable environment and amazing food at good prices.  Portion sizes are also quite generous.  The staff is polite and the TV usually has either soccer or mexican soap operas on, adding to the authentic vibe.

The food needs to be emphasized here though, they have some fantastic options.  First off, the chips and salsas are tasty, they give you a hot blend which I found enjoyable and a mild blend which is has a very traditional taste (cilantro, tomatoes, etc).  Make sure though that you order Guacamole, even if it takes them a while to bring it out.  Their fresh homemade Guac is out of this world, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like Guacamole.  I have to put it on everything I get here though, as it's just that delicious.

Secondly, there are a few main dishes I've had worthy of note.  I'd say the best deal they offer are the tacos, my girlfriend got 2-3 tacos each time with a side, and I think they were about $1.75 or $2 per taco.  This isn't something from taco bell though, these are flavorful and fulfilling jam-packed tortillas, and if you get a side of rice and / or beans it should be more than enough food.  Some of my other favorites, albeit pricey, are the Mexican flag burrito and the Tortas (Mexican Sandwhiches) with slow-roasted pulled pork.  I'd rate one meat over the other, but the Carne Asada, the el pastor pulled pork, and the chicken were all mouth-watering.  Just make sure you wash it down with one of their many beers / sodas available.

Nobody's perfect, so there are a few minor qualms.  The service is terribly slow and inattentive.  They make up for it with warm hospitality, but we often had to wait for drink / chip refills to the point where we had finished the main course and usually had to wait a while to put in our order.  That said, they do get the main courses out promptly, the last time I went I had my meal in less than ten minutes.  Only thing is, we've seen this behavior when we went at 8pm at night on a weekday, so I have no idea how it is when they're packed.  My girlfriend said she went for lunch and it was crazy-crowded (she still got her food though).

Overall, Taqueria is a slice of delight in an unexpected location."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Good Mexican food is hard to find in the Midwest, but you can find some here. The corn tortillas are made fresh, which makes a world of difference. The salsa is spicy, and the pastor and carne asada tacos are what you should get. They also offer classic Mexican dishes like mole, chile relleno, and menudo and pozole on the weekend. Tacos are served Mexico City street taco style with only chopped onions and cilantro on top. The only thing I don't really like about Taqueria Guadalajara is that the entrance opens onto the kitchen, which feels really weird. Dining room is in the back."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Their chips they served were lackluster and there wasn't enough salsa. My taco was fantastic, but the gordita was not good. I was just disappointed."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Went there for the first time last week and I loved it. The moment we walked in, we were seated at the bar where the smiling waitress immediately gave us chips and salsa. As soon as we ordered our beef tongue tacos and carne asada tacos, we had to wait about 5 minutes to get our food (and personally, I was so drawn into the soap opera on the TV, I hadn't even noticed). Everything was delicious. The meat and the tortillas were hot and fresh, sprinkled with cilantro and a splash of fresh lime. We devoured our meal in no time flat. 
The best part is that it was crazy cheap! We spent under $20 for two people with a ton of tacos and beer. I will definitely be coming back."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"My favorite restaurant in Madison.  The prices are great, the food is delicious, and they even have non-boring vegetarian options, especially the vegetarian huarache and sope, and the potato gordita. 

I'm from Portland OR, where you can find pretty good Mexican food.  This place is by far the best Mexican food I've had in Madison, and beats anything I could find in Pittsburgh, PA.  It even rivals my favorite Oregon Mexican places in Portland (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-sirenita-portland) and Eugene (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-siena-eugene).

If you go, be sure to try a sope or huerache if you've never had one before.  As far as I can tell the huerache is the bigger version of the sope.  The base is a 1/2 inch thick (!) soft corn tortilla, made there and freshly grilled.  Next come the beans.  The vegetarian ones are then topped with grilled veggies, including broccoli and carrots, and a generous amount of fresh avocado (scooped right out of the skin while you wait), and finally cheese and sour cream.  Add some of the delicious homemade salsa (there are two kinds) they serve with the free corn chips, and you've got the best meal in town :)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"What a little hole in the wall gem on Park St.! I've heard a lot of buzz about this place in the past, but this is my first time. It's quant and authentic in decor; I like the mix of Badger memorabilia and vibrant yellow, pink, and teal Mexican color scheme. 

I got the enchiladas mole with chicken. I don't think this mole had a chocolate base, but there were definitely notes of cinnamon that showed. Served with a side of beans and rice, this traditional dish was a big eat for only $7! 

My dad got the Platillo Guadalajara, featuring steak, refried beans, pico de gallo, a grilled jalapeño (caution: very spicy!!), and a grilled cactus salad. I've never had cactus before, but it was tangy and tasted pickled...I liked it! 

I would come back just for the complementary verde salsa and chips. It was a smoky flavor, and I couldn't stop eating it! Large portions, definitely a leftover kind of joint. Would be good to-go food too. Yum!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Went here in hopes of having a good pozole rojo, but it was a Tuesday and they only make pozole during the weekend. Instead I was torn between the flauta dinner and the enchiladas verdes. I asked the server which she preferred and she actually offered to serve me a plate with one flauta and one enchailada just so that I could enjoy both! Super attentive and really knew how to please the customer. She also refilled my chips and salsa which were great for snacking. I really enjoyed the chile verde on the enchilada and overall the dish was very good. I also ordered their champurrado which was delicious and perfect for a cold winter day. Can't wait to go back!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,This place is five stars for food but the service is lacking. Food is the best in Madison. The chips and salsa possibly the best I've ever had. The only problem is they give you a really small basket and you have to ask a few times for a refill of the chips but be sure to always ask for salsa because getting them to refill that is also a chore. Everything I've had is delicious not a bad item on the menu. The taco dinner only comes with two but they are hearty and filling even if you're use to getting three.
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Dam it, I picked another place for lunch which was very popular and a line waiting to get a table. We would wait about 25 minutes while watching how the well oiled staff handled the onslaught that was in full action.

The place is small with a bar area in the front and a small dining room in the back. The place had colorful fresh looking walls with open duct work on the ceiling. The tables and chairs are cheap cafeteria style placed in the room.

I was worried when I opened the menu and nothing it was more than $11 and change. I would have the taco dinner for a whopping $7 which was steak and pork with a Negra Mondelo.

The chips and salsa were complementary and filled at least twice while we were there. The salsa was standard but the green was the hot one with better flavor. The chips were commercial tri color but did do the job.

The tacos were very good I must say for $7. They were my kind, meat, cilantro and onions. The corn tortillas had great flavor and cooked perfect on the flat top grill, just in the middle of soft to hard with flexibility left in them. The steak was flavorful and slightly seasoned. The pastor was melt in your mouth tender, i sampled the meats before I put the salsa on them and ate them. The beans were thick and lumpy with onions in them which I liked. The rice as usual does nothing for me. Not one mystery gristle or fat chunks in the meat so they trim the meat well.

Over all for price vs quality this is a solid joint. The tacos were very good and I can see why people wait in line for the place. We had to wait in line to pay on my way out so line in and line out. For price vs quality vs value there cant possibly be anything better and my only problem was no margarita on the menu to complete the whole experience. I wish this was in my neighborhood because I don't anything even close but I'm glad I we stopped by."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Try as I might...I always end up ordering tres tacos de carne asada...con todos...whenever we go here.  If you've never had real Mexican tacos...served on the street preferably, you don't know what you're missing.  It's simple, street food...but so delicious! The carne flavor is transcendent...and when coupled with onions & cilantro...and real corn tortillas...and the essential salsa...ephemerally flavorful and satisfying.  My bf sometimes opts for the huarches...a spectacularly beautiful combination of meat, beans, avocado, lettuce and cheese with a drizzling of sour cream...all in appropriate quantities instead of the typical Americanized Mexican where everything is drenched in cheese or sauce...

Go.  Eat.  Savor...and take some to go...it's equally good or better later or the next day..."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Very small place, super friendly service, really good food, awesome family ""feel"". 1st come, 1st serve seating. Went with a party of 6 total. 2 adults, 2 young children, 2 college kids. There were two large parties of people (6 top & 8 top) waiting to be seated when we arrived. We arrived as my 5 year old was melting down from hunger (and sitting through his sisters orchestra concert). Waiting was becoming a problem--shortly after we arrived as my 65 lb child was sprawled across the only hallway between the kitchen and seating area--he was just DONE. One of the staff, saw me struggling to get my kid up & took it upon herself to bring him a basket of chips & salsa!!! She smiled sympathetically while delivering them. OMG my kid got up and started cooing over the tricolored chips while scarfing them down. That move on the part of that lovely staff person was one of the most thoughtful public displays of parenting support i have ever experienced. We were seated about 7-10 minutes after we arrived. The food itself was very good. All fresh, good flavor, good size portion without being overwhelming."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"This place has been well described by others so I will just say that it is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Pork tacos + some real sugar Coke and some great genuinely hot salsa = happy happy.  My Wife loves the tortas and the food is cheap, fast and delicious.

The only down side for me was that the in-room kitchen put off a bit of grease in the air and during the winter and the place is pretty closed so I had an asthma flare up from breathing the smoke and ended up wheezing my way through my tacos.  But I suppose if they had good ventilation the place would not be the quaint, authentic inexpensive gem that it is."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I was in Madison last week to visit my niece, and we went here for dinner. I had a chicken mole, which was pretty good, especially the mole sauce, however was a bit disappointed by the service. Maybe it was because it was on the later side and our waiter was ready to leave for the night, but both my niece and I felt a bit rushed. If we were going to come back another time, I'd definitely come a little earlier. But as far as the food goes, it was pretty good."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Was really disappointed. The place was messy the service sometimes there or not and the food was one dimentional. 

Menudo soup need the cilantro and onions that were on the side to give it some  spark.

The Platillo Guadalajara was good but easily be made at home better. Fresh items with not much herbs or spices added to them.

The only good thing was the Horchata that was perfectly sweet and spiced.

Hopefully just the items I chose. The nacho looked amazing. Steve L. better check them out."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I am a little disappointed after dining in this week. Service isn't quite as friendly, good, or efficient as it used to be. They literally give you two tablespoons of salsa on first pour, with a few chips. My husband ordered a steak dish that was mostly onion and a few pieces of sparse steak. It looked nothing like the picture. Everything tastes good, it just seems they are getting skimpy on ingredients. I hope that changes soon, as competition is heating up for tacos in Madison! I won't abandon this place, but it might want to revisit its business plan. If they can't keep up with the costs, the menu could stand to go up in price just a tad to make up for it. I'll see how it goes next time."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I was excited that they served taco de lengua beside taco de pastor which is a common type of tacos. The salsa sauces were perfect to me. I really like the spicy one but not for mi amigos mexicanos. Lol  only complaint is they didn't serve a lot of pieces of lime same as in Mexico,  it's just small piece of it on the plate and that is not enough for the real tastes of Mexican foods.

I also had sopa de pozole. It's tasier than when I had in Mexico, maybe bcoz of the well prepared broth. The ambient was just right. It made me think of the taco places in Mexico. All in all, I definitely recommend u guys for this place if u feel like going out of the American atmosphere for an hour. :)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Mi amor...how did I not review you earlier, Guadalajara?
Have been going here since it first opened and it's really exciting to see it flourish!

Chips are now served with both a mild red salsa and a quite hot green salsa.  The tacos and gorditas are the best with either steak (carne) or carnitas (pork), in my opinion.  The gorditas are just steaming hot pockets of deliciousness with refried beans, meat, and cheese.  They do have some vegetarian options on their menu as well.  The guac is the one item that's kind of ""eh"" since it's overly pureed rather than with big chunks.

If you have a group of 4-5, you can order the parrillada, which is an assortment of sausage crumbles, pork al pastor, thinly sliced potatoes, and green onions& potatoes.  All of this is served with rice, beans, guacamole, pepper mix, and tortillas, and it'll feed a crowd!

Love going here, always satisfied with the food, and it's great to see the same friendly faces when you go."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I haven't had good Mexican food in Madison since I first started visiting in 2009, so I was excited to try this place that some local Madison friends enjoy. Guadalajara Taqueria is a small restaurant with a counter for maybe five people and seating in the back with maybe 8 tables. We got seated around 6pm on a Tuesday evening, and the places was packed with a line by the time we left.

Like many taquerias, we were served chips and salsa when we sat down at our table. The chips were kind of fun because they were red, green, and yellow, and the salsa was good, but nothing outstanding. Our chips were refilled when we finished them.

I ordered a burrito mexicana with carne asada. It was a standard burrito on the inside with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream covering the top to visually look like the Mexican flag. Creative! The burrito was good, though what I crave is a San Francisco super burrito.

We also ordered a side of nopales (cactus) and grilled jalapeños. I enjoyed both.

I give this place four stars for Madison, but if it were in California, it'd get three stars."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"There was no parking available out front, so we drove around to the side street to see if we could get to the ""additional parking in the rear.""  We took a chance and turned down a one lane dirt driveway behind some houses.  Bingo!  

They have a walkway ramp that leads to the dining area in the back of the restaurant.  When we stepped just inside the door we were immediately greeted by an intense and humid heat.  There was zero air flow in the dining area, and it was quite stifling.  Like another reviewer, Brian T., mentioned you don't know if you should sit down, wait, stand around with your finger up your nose or what.  Everyone who is already sitting at tables looks up at you curiously, and I couldn't help but wonder if we were just gigantic dorks.  

I flagged down a waitress who said it would be 1 to 5 minutes before we were seated.  Ok, progress.  But as I'm watching her, she actually went over to one occupied table and asked them to move to another table.  Then she had us sit at their table.  Why?????  I felt kind of awkward and tried not to look in their direction after that.  

We ordered a steak chimichanga, chili relenos, potato gordita, and a steak gordita.  They were just ok.  I grew up in California, and I have Mexican friends who taught me some of their authentic Mexican cooking, so I wasn't falling down and convulsing with glee over what we had here.  I definitely wouldn't say it's the best you can find in Madison.  In fact, I'd say it's similar to what you can find just about anywhere in Madison.  

After we finished our meals, we waited and waited and waited for a check.  We were sweating because of the overheated dining area, and really just wanted to get the heck out of there.  Check eventually arrived, but not before my dining companion started to have a mini meltdown.   He stood up from the table and looked like he was either going to pass out or start chewing on his shirt like a weirdo.  I was going to send him outside to spare the other patrons, but then I saw the waitress coming with the check and we were all saved.  

There were just too many problems here, and the food certainly wasn't worth all of the hassle.  So to all of you reviewers who feel like they are having a religious experience when you go here because its just so good, I say ""enjoy"" because I don't wanna!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"There is much to like about Taqueria Guadalajara 2.0: the service is efficient, the menu extensive and you get incredible bang for the buck.  I like but not love the food; there are sub-par elements of any meal juxtaposed against some near transcendent elements.  While not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, it is certainly in the conversation.

The Parrillada that my table ordered during my last visit to Taqueria Guadalajara exemplifies uneven performance of the kitchen.  This dish for four consists of various Mexican grilled meats, roasted potatoes, knob onions, deep-fried jalapeños and grilled cactus.  The steak and rib meat was superb, with a char on the exterior but not overcooked. The same goes for the slightly sweet knob onions, which helped balance out the pile of unctuous grilled meat.  And the oh-so-wonderful corn tortillas served on the side were thick, fresh and loaded with flavor.  On the flip side, the overcooked chorizo added a crunchy element the dish did not need.  The potatoes could provide that textural component if properly prepared, but instead, the limp, under-seasoned spuds seemed out of place, considering the generous pile of starchy Mexican rice served on the side.

The same study in contrasts occurs with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The bland, slightly stale tri-color chips seem out of place in a restaurant that serves such wonderfully fresh corn tortillas.  Taqueria Guadalajara serves two salsas with the chips.  The flavor-packed spicy version is expertly prepared while its milder sibling is a watery mess.

Once you get past the uneven performance of the kitchen, the performance of the restaurant shines.   

The expansive menu offers a vast variety of choices, including numerous vegetarian options.  Adventurous eaters can dine on pig stomachs or beef intestines while the kid's menu gives you the ability to feed the bambinos when you elect to bring them along.  On weekends, the restaurant offers pozole and menudo.  The generous serving sizes mean you will be toting a doggy bag when departing the restaurant.

I have enjoyed top-notch treatment during my visits.  While not overly gregarious, the servers are cordial and efficient.  Even when slammed with customers, I always receive water and complimentary chips and salsa within a couple minutes of being seated.  Also appreciated is how the servers keep a keen eye on the chip basket.  When the chip level starts running low, the server will promptly ask if the table if they want a refill.   They also consistently perform other service basics liking checking in after they deliver the food and promptly removing dirty dishes.  

For a mom-&-pop Mexican restaurant,  Taqueria Guadalajara gets a gold star for cleanliness.  The stainless steel open kitchen still gleans as it did when the restaurant reopened and the tabletops are always spotless.

The serving area is relatively small and there is scant space between the tables.  Eating during peak hours means it may be difficult to carry on a discussion with tablemates at conversational tones.  The dining room has the obligatory muted flat screen tuned to a Liga MX match or other Latin programming.

 Pro tip:  When perusing past reviews, be aware that a completely remodeled Taqueria Guadalajara reopened on August 8, 2013 after a fire closed the restaurant for over six months.  You should discount any comments about the gritty nature of the eatery before that date.

So if you find yourself travelling the South Park Street corridor with a heavy appetite and a light wallet, do not hesitate to pay Taqueria Guadalajara a visit."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Madison - and I have tried most of them.

The vegetarian tacos are delicious, and you can get the taco dinner (2 tacos, rice, and beans) for only two dollars. Their salsa is also delicious.

I will quickly become a regular here - I can't believe it took me so long to find this place!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Best Mexican food in Madison. It is a tiny space and I'm so glad they expanded out the back part of the restaurant. The only down side, if you go during the summer, you may need to bring a jacket, they REALLY blast the A/C in the back area. But enough about that. During peak hours, they do get really busy and there may be a short wait. Parking could be an issue too, but nothing that should deter you from going.

Their food is fantastic. The tacos come with just onions, cilantro and lime and a choice of meats. Their sopes are homemade, and are delicious. I also love the tamales there. I prefer the green tamales over the red, but honestly, they are both great. I also love their pork tenderloin in tomatillo sauce, it's spicy and tangy and is so good! Their salsa is homemade, the mild is so good. and the hot one is really smokey and really hot! Pretty much everything there is great. 

If you call for take out, your stuff is ready in less than 10 minutes, so get in your car as soon as you hang up the phone. The tortillas do get a little soggy once they get packed for a to go order."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Was visiting Madison for the Great Midwest Beer Fest and prior to getting in line for the opening we headed west a bit and via Yelp landed in this little Taqueria.  From the front it almost looks too small to dine-in as there are no tables and just a small counter.  But the server will lead you back, literally through the kitchen, to the dinning area in the back of the restaurant.

As we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't spend too much time searching the menu, quickly selecting a torta.

Our server brought some colored chips and two types of salsas; the chips were good but the salsa was nothing great.  The torta on the other hand was excellent, the steak was juicy and had a hint of grilled, smoky flavor.  The sandwich was huge and was more food then needed (had to save room for 5 hours worth of beer sampling)."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Always delicious and interesting food. Sometimes, my friends are really confused when they receive a taco with cilantro in it instead of cheese, beans and salsa -- all smothered with sour cream.

My favorite experience was the beef tongue tacos and the tripe tacos.  The tongue was incredibly soft and tasty and the the texture of the tripe was really unique and satisfying."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"We've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since moving from California.  And so far Taqueria Guadalajara is the best, hands down, of all the places we've tried.

We've been here twice.  On both visits we ordered the Burrito Mexicano, which is huge and has an excellent balance of meat, cheese, rice, and beans.  The salsa, sour cream, and guacamole on top (which helps create the colors of the Mexican flag) give it good additional flavor.  We've also ordered both times the tacos, which are also tasty--we've ordered the carne asada and pastor tacos.  Great meat flavor and greasy enough to add flavor but you won't have grease dripping down your arms.

We've also had the chicken and cheese tamales, which had good flavor but there wasn't a whole lot of filling inside (especially the cheese), and a sope with chicken, which was delicious with a thick corn tortilla that is crispy on the bottom but soft on top and delicious meat, again.

For our son, we ordered a kid's quesadilla which was alright.  The cheese wasn't melted, but I think they did that so that he didn't burn himself.  If that's the intention, then that was very nice of them.  Our son, as well as do I, loves the horchata, which is a sweet rice drink.  It was tasty and wasn't too thick with rice.  A little more cinnamon would be nice,  though.

And, to be honest, last time we went, I had read Brad R.'s review and was scared about getting food poisoning.  I probably hate being sick more than the average person, so I understand his warning.  However, as I let that thought leave my mind and focused on enjoying the food, I started to think: I'm sure that if you talk to enough people, you'll find someone who has gotten food poisoning or has had some horrible experience at EVERY restaurant there is.  If you want a surefire way to avoid food poisoning, you'll have to stay away from ALL hole-in-the-wall, but authentic places like this restaurant and go to Taco Bell or cook your own food and cook the hell out of everything.  Again, I believe Brad, and I feel bad for his experience, but at the same time, I think you've gotta have trust in a place and hope that you don't get sick."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"It's a hole in the wall, but in my opinion, great food comes from hole in the walls.  After all, I want the place that can sustain a business just from the food alone and not because it's a nice and pleasant place to sit and chat.  

I'm not sure why people say that it's not the cleanest place to eat.  I didn't see any health department ratings, but the place seemed clean enough.  And after a quick scan of the other reviews on this site, it doesn't seem like anybody's gotten sick or anything either.  I suspect it's just more of the usual Madison liberal snobbery because of the cosmetics of the place.  

It's not the best Mexican food I've had.  I'd like their carne asada to be a little bit more marinated.  I had two carne asada tacos and one al pastor.  They were generous wiht the cilantro which is a definite plus.  I'd love a salsa verde option, but I'll take what I can get.  I didn't particularly enjoy the burrito as it felt a bit soggy.  But despite this, it's the best Mexican in Madison.  It'll certainly satisfy my cravings until I can get back to California or actually make the effort to make my own.  

 There isn't really enough seating for big groups here, but take out is always an option."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,This place looks super small from the outside. It is still pretty small from inside too - probably could fit overall 25 - 30 people. The service was fairly slow but the food was good. It was really fresh. We got some colored chips and salsa. We also got some entrees which was good and we shared among 3 of us. 2 entrees were good enough.
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"No one does Mexican food better in Madison than Taqueria Guadalajara. The best part is - every time I go, I try something new. So, I cannot provide a quality review on one single menu item, but I can say they do it right. There's usually some form of soccer/futbol playing on the televisions, and the homemade chips and salsa are completely satisfying. 

The weekend specials are worth the dedicated trip - I had menudo for the first time here and was delighted. While I'm not one to order tripe (beef stomach) specifically - it's use in this soup was spot on.

Overall Taqueria Guadalajara offers wonderful service, wonderful food, and a wonderful atmosphere. Make a trip, you will not regret it!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Ate here in Sept while searching for the best Mexican food in Madison...the search stopped here, this has to be it!

Ordered takeout and the place was packed. While Sitting in the front waiting for my food, I was able to see the work the cooks put into their food. Everything was fresh and made to order.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla which was outstanding.  Moist fresh chicken with cheese, guacamole, lettuce salad and sour cream. Really was a meal in itself. My wife had chicken tacos which were very good according to her. I went with a beef Chimichanga.  While the flavor of the chimichanga was good, it was fairly greasy. Something of a guilty pleasure really and it is HUGE!  This was accompanied with chips and salsa that weren't bad either. Overall my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Pricing was good I thought for the quality you get. Will be a stop often for me on my drives North. Recommend."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,I'm ok with this place. I've actually only gone here a couple times after the rebuild after the fire damage. The food is quite good ranging from average to above average. It's light years ahead of some of the guck I had earlier from Fuzzy's Taco Shop yet I can't say I'd drive here over similar neighborhood tastes like El Pastor or La Hacienda. The reason this place won't get stars higher with me is honestly trhe seating and noise. It feels like I'm in some kind of lunch room in High School all over again when there are more people there. Everyone seems friendly and the servers are friendly but its strange for me to have a meal with people at my elbows that I don't know. The other issue I've come across there is cleanliness ranging from strange things floating in the water to finding a rubber band in the salsa.. It looked like something to just tie jalapenos or tomatos-not a hair band..but still.. I'm sure curiosity will drive me back here again in the future or will venture into a delivery option sometime again.
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I challenge you to find better Mexican food in Madison. 

Just dined there since it's re-opening and it's only gotten better. Clearly they invested in the infrastructure. The salsa got even better and they will sell it if you want to put it on everything you have at home. (guilty)

It's authentic and flavorful. Squeeze limes on everything like its your job. Ask for more salsa because it's that delicious. The torta can easily feed two & is crisped to perfection. My partner in crime had the tacos and left none standing. Everyone was silent as they dined. 

So glad you're back taqueria!

There isn't a lot of seating, so I'd be careful during peak hours. TOTALLY worth the wait. (And easy on your pocketbook!)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Taqueria Guadalajara on Park has some huge positives going for it, which will certainly bring me back, but on the occasion of my first visit there were a few things that were less than stellar. I could see TG regularly hitting a 4 star review and occasionally even a 5 star, but this was my experience today:

Chips and salsa: These were really disappointing. The chips seemed undercooked and were a little leathery. I came in with my son and we were given very few chips. When we asked for more we got another very small basket. The salsas were pretty good (especially the hot), but again the quantities were very limited. I'd happily pay a bit more for enough chips and salsa to enjoy rather than having to ask over and over for very small batches. 

Burrito Mexicana (w/ Carne asada): The burrito was a good size and the guacamole on top was pretty tasty, but that was all of the good. The carne asada had a nice texture, but it was pretty flavorless. A little salt and lime could have gone a LONG way here. There was WAY too much lettuce inside and no enough of everything else. There was also a LOT of tortilla relative to the size of the overall burrito, but fortunately the tortilla was quite good. 

Lomo de puerco in salsa verde: Overall this was my favorite dish of the day. I was hoping for something close to chili verde (which this is NOT), but I enjoyed what I was served nonetheless. The salsa verde has a really good taste, but was a little on the thin side. I also enjoyed the grilled onion served with dish, that added a lot. The pork loin was sliced very thinly and seared pretty hard on the flat top, so it was a little dry. The rice and beans on the side were a nice compliment, and the corn tortillas were excellent! In fact, the corn tortillas may have been the single best thing I had during the entire visit. 

The best thing about TG is the authenticity of the food. There are a number of other dishes I'm excited to try that I think could benefit from this exact authenticity. It's also nice that TG is VERY affordable, but as I mentioned above I'd be okay paying just a bit more for a few things to be a little better. Parking can also be a bit of a chore, but I was lucky and got a spot right out front. The service was very good, and the space is fairly comfortable, albeit slightly on the smaller side. I expect to update this review in the future, but for this particular visit I'd say TG was about a three star stop."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Establishments like this are the exact reason I am grateful for yelp.  We are currently crossing the country from Maine to Washington and have had to rely on either word of mouth, chain restaurants or (thankfully) yelp.  I can honestly say that we probably never would have found this gem if it had not been for yelp.

First of all, we ate at the counter in the front and watched all the magic in the kitchen.  It was warm upfront, but my husband cooled himself with a Negro Modelo, I enjoyed a mandarin soda and our daughter stuck with water.  Everyone was terrifically friendly.  It was a delight to watch all the cooking happening.  The food was incredible to boot.  I had a chicken chimichanga which came with rice, beans and lettuce, my husband had a burrito mexicano with a gordita on the side and our daughter had three chicken tacos.  Combine this with tortilla chips and some of the best salsa I have ever had and we were in heaven.  Just when we thought our meal couldn't get any better, one kindly gentleman who worked here gifted us with a green tamale, on the house.  It.  Was. AMAZING.  Fresh, perfect consistency and positively tasty.

And then there is the thing that drive this amazing establishment into overdrive:  The price.  The grand total for all of the delicious, tasty goodness above?  $26.  Seriously.  The three of us can hardly go out for breakfast at that price, let alone some of the best mexican food we have ever had.  

If you are in Madison run, don't walk, to Taqueria Guadalajara.  You will be delighted that you did."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"We have been on the search for good Mexican in Wisconsin. This is it!!!!

Their salsa is fantastic, fresh and you'll want several helpings. The al pastor (spicy pork) is incredible and their carne asada is delicious. I ordered a chimichanga and my husband and and sister ordered burritos. All of it was great, flavorful, generous portions and best of all, AUTHENTIC. 

The service is fast, friendly, and the staff is really friendly. 

We'll be regulars!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Food wasnt hot when we got it,slow service, store bought chips (stale) with salsa. Taste of food was decent but definitely nothing special."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Wow ...this small hole in the wall is wonderful  from the servive and  love the food totally authentic Mexican food.
Awesome salsa,tortas,enchiladas, amd the flan was so good. I'll definitely come back here."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Great, authentic, inexpensive Mexican.   I especially recommend the chile relleno.  
Fast service, but in no way, ""fast food."" Difficult to get extra chips and more delicious salsa out of the wait staff (in either Spanish or English).  Noisy, back dining room. Don't come here to hold a meeting."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Fast and friendly service.  Clean and affordable.  I had the carne asada and pastor Tacos and a side of Orden de cebollitas cambray.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the taco meat had been better seasoned.  The pastor was not bad, but the steak was very bland.  Everyone I was with seemed pleased with their meal and my husband said we could come back for sure (he is kind of picky). He had the steak quesadilla plate."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"In the famous words of Chuck D and Flavor Flave ""don't believe the hype.""

For years our friends of been raving about this place.  We have heard people call this the ""best Mexican restaurant in Madison"" and other people call it the ""absolute best Mexican food period.""   So after a couple years of wanting to try this place...we finally did.

I cannot complain about the aesthetics...it is a cute little place without all the traditional bright colors....but thats where the good ends.

FIRST OFF:   How can you have a Mexican Restaurant that does not serve Margaritas?    Really?   When I want to devour a burritos I want some Tequila and Lime to go with it.   Even if it is the pre-made junk.

SECOND:  The food was bland.....about as bland as bland can be.   My wife ordered a Chicken Quesadilla as she always does at Mexican restaurant and it literally had ZERO taste.    Heck she had to use all of the salsa form the chips to even remotely get a flavor to it.   Oh...and speaking of chips....they are complete straight out of the bag store bought terrible chips.  Even Laredo's has better chips....well...actually they have better food all together and that is saying a lot!

THRID:  Lets talk my burrito.   I decided to go a different route than my normal fajitas or taco salad and got myself a steak burrito.   OMG....this this was.....TERRIBLE!   The steak was as hard as a rock.  The burrito itself was even more bland than my wife's quesadilla and literally had NO TASTE AT ALL.   Worst part is she stole all the salsa and it took the rest of the meal to get more.

So...when heading up Park street and wanting Mexican food this place is a joke.   Traditional....sure but tasteless traditional and just...I would rather eat at Taco Bell."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"When most people think of Mexican food, they imagine Chipotle. This makes me sad. Mexican food, like Southern food, doesn't look all that fancy, but they taste fantastic. And Taqueria Guadalajara achieves this, in my opinion. I've been their twice now - first time I ordered enchiladas de mole, and the second time I got their marinated beef tongue and some tacos. They do a good job making sure the meats are marinated thoroughly, and they have what seems to be house-made salsa with two spiciness levels, which you can use to taste. Also their beef tongue, scary as that might sound, is actually *incredibly* tender. It's really cozy, and they're open fairly late too - two more points in their favor."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"A great little hole-in-the wall, authentic, that is SUPER kid friendly. Perhaps the best authentic Mexican in Madison. Awesome salsa. Friendly staff. Don't kill it you hipsters."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,Great carne asada burrito. Awesome chips and salsa. Everything very authentic.
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Oh my goodness....I love love love this place!! I've been trying to find good enchiladas and chile relleno since I moved and came to Wisconsin and they have both. The food was hot and fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful. My husband enjoyed the steak tacos. They give you two types of salsa with tortilla chips when you are seated ...one was very hot but both were tasty. Qdoba, Chipotle are fast food compared to this place and I can't even go in those places with a straight face after going to this Taqueria. I will definitely be returning!!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"1416. In case you were wondering that's how many miles it is from the Madison to the border of Mexico. You could drive that, or just dine right here in Madison for authentic Mexican cuisine. 

I want to paint a picture in your mind. You are driving down Park street and you see this very small looking building out your window with a name you can't pronounce. Unless you found it on yelp and were searching for it you might miss it.  You walk in and see an open kitchen, a dinner style bar for guest, and a back dining room.  The smell hits your nose like the first flower of spring. You can see the fresh ingredients being used, you can see them cooking everything.  You have arrived at Taqueria Guadalajara.

Everything about my lunch here was top notch. The price, the food, the friendliness when I pronounced a dish wrong. Even the fresh salsa and tri-colored tortilla chips they give you as soon as you sit down. Let's do the Durley breakdown. 

Food: Trying to pick something was the hardest thing I've done all week. I settled on two tacos and the chilli relleno. 
Tacos: I ordered one tripa (intestine) and one Lengua (beer tongue) Onions and fresh cilantro were topped on both with a double warm, homemade, yes that's right homemade, corn tortilla. (Very important to me that they used corn and not flour) The meat on both tacos was so juicy and flavorful. I was really impressed with the Lengua. I strongly recommend you try it. Seriously, get out of your comfort zone and put some tongue on your tongue!  
Chilli Relleno: This was a good sized plate for the price. One chilli, a side of beans, Mexican rice,  and lettuce,tomatoes. The chilli itself was cooked to perfection and the filling? Oh my, oh my, oh my. Topped off with the homemade sauce.... Can I just move into the basement please? The beans were great. More refried beans style but a little runny so they stayed moist. The rice was not dry at all which was a huge plus, not over or undercooked, just the way momma use to make it ;) 

Drinks: Soda, imported beer, specialty drinks, and of course, my favorite soda, pineapple Jarrito. 

Price: This is the best part. Its so inexpensive for the quality of ingredients. 
Taco ~ $2
Chilli Relleno ~ $7 

I strongly encourage you to try this fabulous place if you want some authentic Mexican cuisine without driving 1,416 miles."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"By far the best Mexican food I've ever had! Don't let the exterior of the building turn you away...the pink paint makes it look a little sketchy, but the taste of the food put out by this kitchen is off the charts.

To start with, there are 2 kinds of salsa that are really good. Then, I had the Huaraches with steak...so good! My boyfriend ate a chicken chimichanga..best chimichanga either of us has ever tried! The portion sizes are huge, and the prices are really good. Definitely a place I will visit again when I'm in the area!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Really good tacos and salsa.  Nothing too special about the place.  I've dined in and gotten delivery.

Will get it again, no doubt."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"This place isn't the best restaurant in Madison.

It's not even the best Mexican restaurant in Madison.

Best Mexican-Restaurant-Housed-In-An-Obnoxiously-Pink-Building?

I think we can safely give it that.

A work colleague and I were in downtown Madison the other day and looking for a place to have lunch.  Usually when we want Mexican and are a bit further west La Guanajuatence is our go-to place.  Being further east I scoured Yelp and found that Guadalajara was likely our best bet.

We were not disappointed.

I just want to say that this is only a four-star review because the previously mentioned place got five-stars from me and Guadalajara was just not quite as good.

In every other way other than direct comparison it was spectacular.  I had a chicken sope and a three-pack of tacos.  One tripe, one tongue, and one el pastor.  My colleague had a pork chimichanga.  Obviously, we both had chips and salsa + Mexican coke.

Chips and salsa were good.  I see other reviewers rave about them, but I really thought they were only okay.  La Guanajuatence has a salsa BUFFET w/ fifteen salsas.  You really can't compare the two.

Tacos were GREAT.  The tripe taco was the best thing I've eaten yet this year.  It's probably better than anything I ate most of last year.  Crunchy one one side and soft and unctuous on the other.  It was the highlight of my week, seriously.  So so so good.  Everything else was delish as well.  The sope was chewy and thick and cheesy and delicious.  W/ a little of the hot salsa from the chips on top it was just what I needed to top off the meal.

Service was awesome.  We were on a tight schedule, let the waitress know this and were in/out w/in thirty minutes of placing our order.

I really enjoyed this place and will go again w/out hesitation if we're in the area.

That said, since I gave La Guanajuatence five-stars I don't see how I can give this place the same rating.

Four Stars from me, but go yourself because it's probably five-stars good."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,Okay okay okay..... I went back to this place with a friend... I was reluctant at first but meh I said what the hell.... I will try it again... We actually ate inside of the restaurant we where seated quickly we ordered extra chips and salsa but I think our waiter had forgotten... We asked him like three times... My friend and I chatted it up so we weren't to worried about it... I had flautas the chicken ones yummy next time I think I will ask for the dressings on the side they got really soggy... But they were really good so this place isn't that bad... It's okay
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I live six blocks away, but its natty exterior scared me off. The other day, I scoped Mexican restaurants and this came very highly rated. 

As we walked in (with my 11-year-old), it was clean and rustic (another word for an outdated and sparse sh*thole). The clientele combined many Hispanics casually speaking Spanish (big plus) and face-filled Caucasians. Within 10 seconds of seating, we had a bowlful of chips and fresh mild / hot salsa and very pleasant greeting from the server.    

Opening the menu, they filled the pages with Mexican perfection. We're a little adventurous (me more so than my 11-year-old) and was excited by the menu items of tripe, tongue and cactus. OMG, right!?!?! Those items are only found in a Taco Bell entree by freak accident. 

Don't worry, there are many conventional items as well. 

Chowing on chips, we slugged a couple of Jarrito sodas (I had tamarind and he had lime). Before 10 minutes passed, our burritos came. He had beef and I had seasoned pork steak (carne el pastor). While digging in mine, I had to nibble on his too. Both were incredible; the meat was tender and delicious and included sides were refried beans (perfectly seasoned, cooked and homemade) and delicious rice (slightly smoked and cooked to perfection). We were in such delight, I do not know we recalled breathing.

To go, we picked a beef tongue taco (he would not promise to resist French-kissing the taco); Platillo Guadalajara (special with steak, chile and cactus); chimichanga (MASSIVE); tamale dinne and  two Cokes (glass bottle) for UNDER $50! 

Before I typed this up, I sampled the plates and the food is consistent. All the food is homemade, filling and perfectly textured/seasoned. 

I feel like such and idiot for holding out on this joint."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"My understanding is this place was recently re-constructed after a burn-down fire -- nice work!  The interior is welcoming but definitely sit by the back if you can.  Lunch gets verrrry busy so aim to time it right.  

As far as food, I can only speak to the tacos which were flavorful and mostly authentic.  The other dishes looked hearty and balanced.  The appetizer chips didn't appear to be made on site, which is disappointing -- but the salsa seemed homemade.  Service is attentive and prices reasonable.  I look forward to working my way around the menu."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,Stopped in for some afternoon tacos because I had heard so much about this place. The tacos were really good and the staff was extremely friendly. Great child and salsa as well. I was also really surprised to see how crowded it was for 3:30 on a Saturday.
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I think authentic pretty well sums it up. This spot has excellent basic Mexican staples, is affordable, and probably rocks it out for best Mexican in Madison. Very different atmosphere from La Mestiza, which is typically quiet and more private. This place is bustling and loud; great for groups. The tacos were delicious, served on double corn tortillas (good move). Chips and salsa were so-so (Mestiza much better). Odd thing: soft drinks served in individual cans, not as fountain beverage (not a huge fan). But overall, where it counts-- for an entree, this place was the bomb."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"This place is fantastic!!!
Came here for lunch last weekend and everything was wonderful...the food and service!
The salsa is yummy and the servers don't seem to mind when you ask for more tortilla chips.  They were also very helpful in making sure that we had vegetarian food and were great about making substitutions.
Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town :)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Had driven by this place a few times while visiting back in Madtown, looked pretty real and was on the right side of town so had to try. Yay! Real mexican, made & served by the same, and the place full of local hispanic families. Yes, it was hot & humid (Madison in August, right?) and my togo sat for 5mins before I got my ticket. The world didn't end with a 5min wait and the food was FANTASTIC! Lingua tacos, melt in your mouth good. Carne asada burrito, best since San Diego street food.  Realize your a gabacho, gringo, and get some darn fine mexi here!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Can't believe I haven't written a review yet.

This place has the best Mexican food I've found so far in Madison (I've had better elsewhere, but it really is quite good for serving white bread Wisconsinites) and they are quite affordable!

SO sticks with the Lomo de Puerco en Salsa Verde every time, tender with a nice heat. I jump around and have tried a variety of taco, burrito, quesadilla, and platillo combinations. I recommend pork for your choice of meat, flavorful but not tough or stringy. Definitely try a horchata, Mexican Coke, or Jarritos with your meal. Tamarind Jarritos is my favorite.

The place is small, with a pick up spot and small counter in front, with maybe 10 tables in the back. I recommend an early lunch/dinner especially if you want a meal on the weekends (!!) so you don't have to wait in the cramped space up front (the line extends outside even during winter..). Thankfully food comes out pretty fast and you get free salsa and chips to curb your hunger pangs."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"You will not find better mexican food in Madison, that's a sure thing, possibly all of Wisconsin, maybe something decent in Milwaukee. This is the closest thing to the kick-ass mexican offered in Los Angeles. If you expect to be seated in a middle of the road white surburban scared of foreigners sort of way, you're way out of your league. Go back to Applebee's. This is a family owned and run authentic mexican joint. They know what they are doing and they do it well. I have found the tamales to be pretty awesome, the burrito is okay, the fresh salsa is amazing and spicy, I love the roasted jalapenos, of course I do that at home myself now, my wife likes the tortas. I've had the Guadalajara plate, which was pretty good. Try some things that you would not normally try, and have some new experiences. It might not be super duper fantastic to you, but then you know what you like and what you don't.

If you go to LA ever, try La Fogata's on Van Nuys in Sherman Oaks. That is truly kick-ass, the fresh salsa, the burritos, the tamales, etc. That would get 5 stars for sure, and compared to La Fogata's in LA, this place in Madison would probably be 3.5 stars. But I gave it 5 based on Madison, and what little quality food there is in Wisconsin in general, unless all you eat are brats and cheese, then you are in the right place! Go Badgers?"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"This place is so good! Very authentic and great prices! 
I had the chicken chimichanga which was awesome. It came with rice, beans, and pico on the side and it was plenty of food for one person. 
My friends had the beef tacos and they also looked amazing with just the right amount of cilantro. Just make sure you ask for cheese if you like cheese on tacos like I do.
I would defiantly eat here again and for the cheap price why not!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I don't know Mexican, but I know what I like. And this is it. Also, it's cheap. Easily spend less than $7 on a meal.

I was introduced by a friend who lived down the street. He's since moved, which removed a ready excuse to visit this fantastic place. Luckily another friend has moved into the area.

I just love the flavor of of the food here, my absolute favorite being the steak huarache (avocado, lettuce, tomato, and meat piled onto a flatbread). It starts out great, but spoon a bunch of the mild salsa (true, I can't take too much heat growing up in the Midwest, but I like chunks of veggies in my salsa and the flavor more than the saucy hot) and it gets even better. The tortas (big ol' sandwich) are also good for a change of pace. Haven't been able to resist the standbys enough to get deeper into the menu so I can't comment on the burritos, enchiladas, etc but have heard good things from my friends."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"All these Yelp reviews hype this place up a bit... I was so excited to go here but the food didn't impress me! The horchata was a spicy (not hot, spice-y!) creamy dream, and my friend described her stuffed chile pepper as a ""veggie delight."" But the chips and salsa and my other pal's chimichanga were both average, and my Platillo Guadalajara was just meh! The corn tortillas and beans were good, but the beef and veggies were too oily and I didn't like that the cactus side, although tasty, was served cold. Mexican food is Mexican food and it's always good to eat, but I won't go out of my way to come back here! Los Gemelos is still the king of Madison Mexican food in my book."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Best Mexican in Madison (well chimichanga, at least!). I love the green salsa and the chicken chimichanga. Perfect hole-in-the-wall family-owned  kind of atmosphere; everyone is super nice. Highly recommended.

Only downfall is no margaritas!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Qualifications:  Resident of San Diego for 4 years, frequenter of Taco Shops.

Quick synopsis:  Highly Recommended, great food great prices.  Will go back soon.

We had a group of 4 total, one of which is an 11 month old baby, for lunch around 1:30 on a Saturday.  We sat at a table pretty quickly however the 2 baby seats were taken.  By the time were were leaving every available seat was taken.  To start they brought out some chips and salsa.  The chips were regular but the salsa's were home made and fantastic.  There was a red and a picante.  I bought a cup of the picante for $4 to take home, it was pretty much the perfect spiciness.  

Between us all we order Chile Relleno, Taco Dinner, Veggie Sopa, Chicken Enchilada, and a Chicken Taco.  My order was the Relleno and for $7 I couldn't expect anything more.  Rice, re-fried beans, lettuce, tomato, the chile, and 5 corn tortillas.  I was really stoked on the tortillas because usually a place only gives you like 2.  Everything on the dish was very good.  I was actually really surprised on how tasty the chile was.  It came with a ""traditional red sauce"" on it that complimented it really nicely.  I am a pretty big eater and was satisfied after I was done.  

My baby had the chicken taco for $2.  She can't talk but we are pretty sure she loved it.  We were really happy that there was something so simple on the menu we could offer her.  I finished off what she didn't eat and I thought the shredded chicken had a great flavor and was tender.  My wife got the taco dinner that came with beans and rice.  It came with 2 tacos carne and pork.  She said she really liked the carne but the pork was pretty standard.  She wanted to specifically note that the tortillas were fantastic, I agree.

Mother in law got the Sopa ($3) and Enchilada ($7).  I had a bite of each.  I haven't eaten too much sopa but it was absulutely delishes, I like to call it an open faced tamale.  Her burrito was covered in a green sauce that had quite a nice flavor, you could really taste the pepper in it.  MIL said they were really good and the value for the price was excellent.

I wish I could give out fractions of stars because I don't really like giving out 5 unless it totally blows me away.  I would give them at least 4.5 though.  It exceeded our expectations, which started high, and the prices were very good.  The dining area isn't very large so if you have a big group I would probably stay away.  But for a family I think it was perfect.  Nice moderate ambient noise to keep baby happy and great food for dad."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I've been here a couple of times, one was to order, and the other to dine in. Both times I ended up getting chimichangas. The first time, I ordered the chicken chimi, and it was alright, the meat was pretty dry. But the second time when we dined in, I ordered the pork chimichanga and it was so flavorful and tender. We started off with complimentary chips and salsa and the salsa was really really good. Unfortunately they were served in single serve bowls and there were 4 of us eating so it wasn't enough. We also started off with some guacamole and that was pretty small too, it was super super good, but I don't know if it was worth the money to get that small of serving. Besides small servings of chips and salsa, the service wasn't that great either. Not a deal breaker but not that efficient. There was only 1 wait staff person for all 9-10 tables which made getting more water, chips & salsa, the bill, etc. a lengthy wait. I do wanna come back here and explore more of the menu"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I love this place and for a while when they closed down after the fire I was so sad thinking that is it for my favorite mexican food place. Heaved a sigh of relief when they re-opened, and boy, were they popular! They weeks right after the re-opening saw huge crowds even after they expanded their sitting area. You can tell this place is authentic by the sheer number of mexican diners ~~

The moment you get seated they will start you off with water and tortilla chips with salsa while you look over the menu and wait for your food.

Love their huarache and their tortas. And the grilled cactus plate. Well you could hardly go wrong with mexican grilled meat, potatoes, fresh salsa and avocado/guacamole etc. And these are all made to perfection!

If you visit on weekends, they have the menudo, a soup with beef tribe (stomach). Caution: The serving for that is humongous! Probably that alone will fill you up, so if you are going to order something else in addition, might be a good idea to split the soup with your group. 

I can't stop going on and on about this place. Their service is awesome for such a busy eatery. The waitresses are always smiling and friendly and service is prompt. If you like, you can also sit at the counter area where you can watch the chefs grilling the meat as you munch away on yours =)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Truly a diamond in the rough.  We always order out due to the smallness of the dining area, but the authentic tamales and tacos simply cannot be beat! Also of note, is their delicious salsa.  Caution to those who do not like hot!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Pretty authentic Mexican with very reasonable prices. We tried enchiladas (chicken) in verde sauce and the chimichanga with Pork. Though the chimichanga was a little greasy but perfectly crispy on the outside. They serve warm colorful chips with an awesome spicy salsa and okayish mild one. Do try the guac, it's nice and refreshing. We also gulped the meal down with a Jarrito lime, a good call."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Love the beer choices. Too bad there aren't margaritas. Staff are great, attentive enough to have your needs met. Quick enough for work lunch! Chips and salsa replenished a few times.

The place is small and cozy, windows along the back wall. I like the bright walls and flatware.

The food was excellent - rice, beans, burrito, tacos, steak, fried jalapeno, chips, two types of salsa, Modelos. I'll be back for sure; there are many more items on the menu I hope to try."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Taqueria Guadalajara re-opened August 8 after re-modeling due to extensive fire damage.  The layout is the same but everything is new and clean so the place does not have quite the same hole-in-the- wall feel.  It was packed with a diverse clientele and many families out for Sunday dinner.  Service was friendly though slow.  The food was very tasty and portions were ample. My husband had chicken quesadillas, my son chicken tacos and I had the pozole, available on weekends only, and we all enjoyed our dishes.  The noise level is high and tables along the side wall are cramped but overall it was an enjoyable experience."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I'm spoiled from the south side of Milwaukee where food carts and restaurants serving excellent food are aplenty. 

Still, they serve two tacos for two bucks on corn tortillas with carne asata, cilantro, and onion. That's my goto whenever I hit up the pink house."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"How have I not reviewed my favorite Madison Mexican joint?

This place is sooo good.  Free salsa and chips? Check. A nice assortment of Mexican Brews? Check.  Fresh Tamales? Check. The only thing they are missing is Margaritas. 

I swear you could order your food and have it served in the time its takes Univision to do a commercial break.  They are that fast.  

I had never had a huarache before coming here.  Now the Huarache Mexicano is my go to.  My gf loves the burritos.  Their tacos al pastor are a lesson in simple awesomeness.  

I actually came here up talk up their chicken chimichanga.  I was hungover and wanted some comfort food that only The Taqueria could offer.  I had heard the chimis were awesome but I never got around to trying the deep fried goodness.  Oh My God was it great.  It was cheesy fried awesome.   I don't want to know how many calories are in a deep fried chicken burrito.  The worst part about my last visit is now I know I like deep fried chicken burritos.  I didn't need to know that.  I was perfectly fine with regular burritos. Oh Well."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"A bunch of my friends and I had been meaning to try out this place because it is so close to where I live, usually looks busy, and we are curious people. We finally got around to it last night, and it was the best homemade Mexican food I have had yet in Madison!

The front part has a dining counter with a grill, which looked inviting, but we sat in the back part of the restaurant with tables. The two salsas they serve before the meal are great - although the green salsa was a bit more spicy than I prefer, it was still delicious, and I'm sure people with a higher tolerance for heat would absolutely love it.
  
I had a burrito mexicano (which comes with mild red salsa, sour cream and guacamole spread on the top to look like a Mexican flag) with steak. It tasted far better than any burrito I'd had in recent memory. I was surprised at how few beans were in it, but it may have been because the two people I was with ordered theirs with no beans and they came back a couple of times to make sure they had our order correct. I was happy with the staff there for that very reason and also because they were just pleasant to begin with.

For what you get, there's no beating the price, either :) I will definitely be back for more!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"If you want to eat REAL Mexican food, visit Taqueria Guadalajara. It's a tiny space with an open kitchen. Sit at the front counter if you can, so you can enjoy the full cultural experience. 

We've visited several times, but I'll focus on my most recent visit. It was Saturday lunch. We arrived just prior to 11:30, after having been to indoor cycling class earlier that morning, so we were starving for an early lunch. Good thing we arrived when we did, as the place was completely packed 10 minutes after we arrived.

I ordered the huarache el Paisano, which is refried beans, a piece of grilled cactus, fried onions, green salsa, melted cheese and topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado and sour cream. It's an entire platter of food for only $7. The steak version of this dish is also $7, so they keep the prices very reasonable.

Service was super friendly and fast. I also enjoyed a Mexican Coca-Cola.

Do yourself a favor and visit this authentic Mexican restaurant on Park St."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I would give this place a 5 star except that I'm still a tough love reviewer and I only reserve 5 stars for impeccable ambiance and food to match.  The food was delicious and the wait staff was very attentive.

I had the torta de carne asada, and my dining buddy ordered the torta mexicana.  I know a thing or two about tortas because my family used to run a taco truck in the 1990s with only Mexican customers. I expected the torta de carne asada to be similar to what my friend ordered, the torta mexicana-- a flat strip of tender meat, cilantro, and tomato, mayonnaise, salsa, etc.  I would order what she ordered since my torta carne asada came undone too easily.  I don't want to be a messy eater if I'm about to go to another meeting afterwards. 

Enough with categories-- the tacos looked delicious, and free chips and salsa. the spicy salsa was pretty spicy, stick to the red mild sauce for the faint of heart.  This isn't child's play. 

I also ordered the horchata rice milk cinnamon beverage. Good stuff. 

To one side of me was a group of gringolandia college badgers, and to my right were Mexican customers who only spoke Spanish with the owners, in a very friendly demeanor as though they are regulars. The seating availability during lunch was spacious, but it might be during when school was not in session. 

Try this place before you decide to drop money at a chain Mexican burrito place."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Tiny hole-in-the-wall...two tables that can seat 2 people each, and then a small counter.  Most of the kitchen is right before your eyes--so you can see how they prepare the food.

The food here?  Absolutely top-notch.  Very fresh.  Muchisimo sabor!!!  The hot salsa here is so flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it even when my face was burning.  Lots of fresh avocado, onion, cilantro, everything was so good and balanced just right."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I'm so glad Madison has real Mexican food! And Guadalajara does it well. Cheap prices, cane sugar sodas, Mexican cable channel blaring, an open kitchen so you can actually see them cooking your food, and a friendly atmosphere. We ordered lunch to go and it was delicious. Their house marinated pork is AMAZING. The chicken enchiladas are also very tasty. Guadalajara is also open quite late, which is great if you ever get those late night munchies.

The waitress also seemed incredibly capable and on top of things. I see a lot of complaints about the service of this place, but I was honestly impressed. Considering the restaurant was kinda packed, we received great service for being to go customers. We were greeted with a friendly welcome, and she even gave us chips and salsa while we were waiting to take home our order. I usually don't tip when I get take out, but I couldn't help it after seeing the waitress handle everything so swiftly and elegantly. I guess I just have a soft spot for hard-working, capable waitresses :)

I didn't get to try the tamales this time, but I saw some people buying them by the gallon-size bag and they looking delicious. I'll have to get tamales next time..."
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"FINALLY! I found good carry-out mexican food in Madison. I usually go to La Hacienda out of old college day habits of seeking cheap cheap cheap mexican food. Lately, I've been seeking something better like I got used to while living in San Diego...Guadalajara was pretty close. I went to Francisco's first, but they were closed on Sundays (they did have a sign in the window ""$10 margarita pitchers"" so I have a feeling my straw and I will eventually try it out).

I got a burrito which was outstanding and only $6. My only complaints were that the cheese was melted on the exterior (making it hard to eat w/o a fork and knife), it was zapped in the microwave (unnecessary if the cheese was placed inside), and the lady was trying to be skimpy on the salsa (I wanted to try it all). 

Everyone was speaking Spanish, it was extremely quick, the staff was very friendly, all the other food going out looked great, the place seemed clean despite its quirky late night drunken Cabo taco shop appearance and the salsa was really good in my opinion. 

I can't wait to go back!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I love guad. Had a vegetarian huarache and some refried beans and rice and was just the happiest camper. I would say this is authentic, significantly better than any chain Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately I can see this becoming a weekly delivery order. (Side note: I've only ordered delivery and never actually been there.) (second side note: mild salsa is amazing and the guac is ever so spicy.)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Don't let the pink siding and the decor inside scare you away.  The food here is in my top 3 in Madison.  Basically working off of a flat top and deep fryer, the small kitchen puts out solid and delicious (and very affordable) eats.  Their tacos are great.  Classic two corn tortillas wrapped around a meat, cilantro, and onions.  They bring out two different types of salsa for you to choose from.  Make sure you try either the sopes (ingredients on top) or the gordita (ingredients stuffed inside).  Both are made using a thicker tortilla that puffs up when fried. They are out of this world and for around $2.50 each, they are a bargain.

Note:  If you decide to sit in the front of the restaurant, be prepared to carry the smells of the kitchen with you the rest of the day.  To me, a small price to pay to eat excellent fare!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"I can see why this place is loved. They make their food with love. It's authentic alright. I still prefer Casa del Sol and Laredo's any day tho. The salsa is tasty but full of chunks and the really hot salsa is just that, reallllllllllly hot. Too hot to enjoy. But the chimichanga and the steak quesadilla were delicious. Juicy, shredded chicken, buttery quesadilla, great guacamole for only $2! Just watch out for bones in the chicken. I crunched into a large one. Almost made me lose my appetite. Food was too good to stop eating tho. I decided not to mention the bone because I just wanted to have a good time without any drama. I'm not afraid to mention it here tho, just as a warning to you all. Chew carefully and enjoy!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,extra side of salsa,"Mexican patrons lining up outside a Mexican place is always a good sign. The place is a hidden gem in Wisconsin. It doesn't show up on most internet top ten lists, but most residents know about the place. 

I had a pork chimichanga for $7. When they say stuffed with meat, it was stuffed!! They did not shortchange me. The same item in a fancier setting would be at least $20. It was a little greasy, but hey, it is a deep fried burrito. 

The spicy salsa is good. But do ask for gauc. It was very well done. I also tried a Jarritos which is supposed to be a Mexican soda. I went with lime though most people recommend the tamarind. My partner had the chicken enchiladas which was flavorful."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"This is one of those true Yelp success stories.

I grew up mostly in Madison but lived in Milwaukee for a number of years where Mexican food is ridiculously good.  Whether it be from one of the amazing restaurants on the Southside or the authentic Mexcian grocers (El Ray), you really can't go wrong.  Up until I went to Taqueria, I hadn't run into a restaurant in Madison that I would even deem ""acceptable"" for Mexican food.

There's a few places that were decent, but nothing that ever stuck out or that had all the right stuff put together.  Each place lacked either taste, proper pricing, or variety on their menu.

Well Taqueria Guadalajara solves that issue ten-fold in my opinion.  They are pretty much just what others describe here; a very very small mom & pop operation with a comfortable environment and amazing food at good prices.  Portion sizes are also quite generous.  The staff is polite and the TV usually has either soccer or mexican soap operas on, adding to the authentic vibe.

The food needs to be emphasized here though, they have some fantastic options.  First off, the chips and salsas are tasty, they give you a hot blend which I found enjoyable and a mild blend which is has a very traditional taste (cilantro, tomatoes, etc).  Make sure though that you order Guacamole, even if it takes them a while to bring it out.  Their fresh homemade Guac is out of this world, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like Guacamole.  I have to put it on everything I get here though, as it's just that delicious.

Secondly, there are a few main dishes I've had worthy of note.  I'd say the best deal they offer are the tacos, my girlfriend got 2-3 tacos each time with a side, and I think they were about $1.75 or $2 per taco.  This isn't something from taco bell though, these are flavorful and fulfilling jam-packed tortillas, and if you get a side of rice and / or beans it should be more than enough food.  Some of my other favorites, albeit pricey, are the Mexican flag burrito and the Tortas (Mexican Sandwhiches) with slow-roasted pulled pork.  I'd rate one meat over the other, but the Carne Asada, the el pastor pulled pork, and the chicken were all mouth-watering.  Just make sure you wash it down with one of their many beers / sodas available.

Nobody's perfect, so there are a few minor qualms.  The service is terribly slow and inattentive.  They make up for it with warm hospitality, but we often had to wait for drink / chip refills to the point where we had finished the main course and usually had to wait a while to put in our order.  That said, they do get the main courses out promptly, the last time I went I had my meal in less than ten minutes.  Only thing is, we've seen this behavior when we went at 8pm at night on a weekday, so I have no idea how it is when they're packed.  My girlfriend said she went for lunch and it was crazy-crowded (she still got her food though).

Overall, Taqueria is a slice of delight in an unexpected location."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Their chips they served were lackluster and there wasn't enough salsa. My taco was fantastic, but the gordita was not good. I was just disappointed."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"What a little hole in the wall gem on Park St.! I've heard a lot of buzz about this place in the past, but this is my first time. It's quant and authentic in decor; I like the mix of Badger memorabilia and vibrant yellow, pink, and teal Mexican color scheme. 

I got the enchiladas mole with chicken. I don't think this mole had a chocolate base, but there were definitely notes of cinnamon that showed. Served with a side of beans and rice, this traditional dish was a big eat for only $7! 

My dad got the Platillo Guadalajara, featuring steak, refried beans, pico de gallo, a grilled jalapeño (caution: very spicy!!), and a grilled cactus salad. I've never had cactus before, but it was tangy and tasted pickled...I liked it! 

I would come back just for the complementary verde salsa and chips. It was a smoky flavor, and I couldn't stop eating it! Large portions, definitely a leftover kind of joint. Would be good to-go food too. Yum!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"My favorite a la carte Mexican restaurant in Madison is back, with a fresh new coat of paint and the same familiar vibe. My favorite dish went up in price and was renamed to Platillo Guadalajara, but it's still the same fatty thin-sliced steak with crispy ends goodness. I like to eat half the plate with corn tortillas and pack the rest away for tomorrow's lunch. 

It can be fun to watch the kitchen bustle at the counter seats, but you'll definitely leave smelling like tortillas and onions. The spacious room in the back is usually filled with couples and families during lunch on the weekends. Taqueria Guadalajara is on its way to becoming a Madisonian institution."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"DON'T LET THE SHADY PINK BUILDING FOOL YOU! YELP helped me discover this hidden gem. The food was super good and super authentic. I found my inner fatman while I was here and sampled two tacos, a gordita, and sope. The TACOS were to die for. By far MY FAVORITE. I had one steak and one pork. DELICIOUS! The SOPE and GORDITA were just more of the same goodness in a fried tortilla. Super Good, and Super Cheap. Check it out!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,Absolutely fantastic food! I had the chimichanga with steak and my husband had the burrito Mexicano. Both were very good and I don't think I've ever had a better chimichanga in my life! The horchada is also very creamy and flavorful. Our new Mexican restaurant favorite!
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Dam it, I picked another place for lunch which was very popular and a line waiting to get a table. We would wait about 25 minutes while watching how the well oiled staff handled the onslaught that was in full action.

The place is small with a bar area in the front and a small dining room in the back. The place had colorful fresh looking walls with open duct work on the ceiling. The tables and chairs are cheap cafeteria style placed in the room.

I was worried when I opened the menu and nothing it was more than $11 and change. I would have the taco dinner for a whopping $7 which was steak and pork with a Negra Mondelo.

The chips and salsa were complementary and filled at least twice while we were there. The salsa was standard but the green was the hot one with better flavor. The chips were commercial tri color but did do the job.

The tacos were very good I must say for $7. They were my kind, meat, cilantro and onions. The corn tortillas had great flavor and cooked perfect on the flat top grill, just in the middle of soft to hard with flexibility left in them. The steak was flavorful and slightly seasoned. The pastor was melt in your mouth tender, i sampled the meats before I put the salsa on them and ate them. The beans were thick and lumpy with onions in them which I liked. The rice as usual does nothing for me. Not one mystery gristle or fat chunks in the meat so they trim the meat well.

Over all for price vs quality this is a solid joint. The tacos were very good and I can see why people wait in line for the place. We had to wait in line to pay on my way out so line in and line out. For price vs quality vs value there cant possibly be anything better and my only problem was no margarita on the menu to complete the whole experience. I wish this was in my neighborhood because I don't anything even close but I'm glad I we stopped by."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"This is considered one of the best taco places in Madison, and it is just that.  The best taco place in Madison, not the best I've had regrettably.  
I decided to go outside ""the norm"" and ordered the cow tongue and intestine taco.   It was well cooked, garnished, and presented, but lacked taste. 
Some foodies believe that to truly appreciate the taste of a meal you shouldn't season it, but I'm not them.  A pinch of salt would've carried this dish a long way. 
I also decided to be adventurous and ordered the cactus huaraches and unfortunately I didn't like it.  Something felt amiss.  Maybe it's because it didn't have meat, but from perception alone I was hoping for a heartier feel after eating it.  
Nonetheless, better than most taco places, but I miss my taco trucks."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I am a little disappointed after dining in this week. Service isn't quite as friendly, good, or efficient as it used to be. They literally give you two tablespoons of salsa on first pour, with a few chips. My husband ordered a steak dish that was mostly onion and a few pieces of sparse steak. It looked nothing like the picture. Everything tastes good, it just seems they are getting skimpy on ingredients. I hope that changes soon, as competition is heating up for tacos in Madison! I won't abandon this place, but it might want to revisit its business plan. If they can't keep up with the costs, the menu could stand to go up in price just a tad to make up for it. I'll see how it goes next time."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I was excited that they served taco de lengua beside taco de pastor which is a common type of tacos. The salsa sauces were perfect to me. I really like the spicy one but not for mi amigos mexicanos. Lol  only complaint is they didn't serve a lot of pieces of lime same as in Mexico,  it's just small piece of it on the plate and that is not enough for the real tastes of Mexican foods.

I also had sopa de pozole. It's tasier than when I had in Mexico, maybe bcoz of the well prepared broth. The ambient was just right. It made me think of the taco places in Mexico. All in all, I definitely recommend u guys for this place if u feel like going out of the American atmosphere for an hour. :)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Very good, but not the best in Madison. Great steak and pork tacos, with the tortillas cooked in griddle grease. Yum. Decent torta though it's covered in margarine. Definitely worth a visit. 

The only thing is that this place is really dirty and grimy. It qualifies as 'beyond-dive' in that way, though everything is cooked out in the open and in front of you and seems professional enough. Why not just mop the floors once in a while?"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Mi amor...how did I not review you earlier, Guadalajara?
Have been going here since it first opened and it's really exciting to see it flourish!

Chips are now served with both a mild red salsa and a quite hot green salsa.  The tacos and gorditas are the best with either steak (carne) or carnitas (pork), in my opinion.  The gorditas are just steaming hot pockets of deliciousness with refried beans, meat, and cheese.  They do have some vegetarian options on their menu as well.  The guac is the one item that's kind of ""eh"" since it's overly pureed rather than with big chunks.

If you have a group of 4-5, you can order the parrillada, which is an assortment of sausage crumbles, pork al pastor, thinly sliced potatoes, and green onions& potatoes.  All of this is served with rice, beans, guacamole, pepper mix, and tortillas, and it'll feed a crowd!

Love going here, always satisfied with the food, and it's great to see the same friendly faces when you go."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I will just briefly add to the chorus of positive reviews. I went on Cinco de Mayo, and even though they had a crowd, the service was quick and friendly. I had a taco with lengua, and enchiladas de mole. Both excellent."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"There is much to like about Taqueria Guadalajara 2.0: the service is efficient, the menu extensive and you get incredible bang for the buck.  I like but not love the food; there are sub-par elements of any meal juxtaposed against some near transcendent elements.  While not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, it is certainly in the conversation.

The Parrillada that my table ordered during my last visit to Taqueria Guadalajara exemplifies uneven performance of the kitchen.  This dish for four consists of various Mexican grilled meats, roasted potatoes, knob onions, deep-fried jalapeños and grilled cactus.  The steak and rib meat was superb, with a char on the exterior but not overcooked. The same goes for the slightly sweet knob onions, which helped balance out the pile of unctuous grilled meat.  And the oh-so-wonderful corn tortillas served on the side were thick, fresh and loaded with flavor.  On the flip side, the overcooked chorizo added a crunchy element the dish did not need.  The potatoes could provide that textural component if properly prepared, but instead, the limp, under-seasoned spuds seemed out of place, considering the generous pile of starchy Mexican rice served on the side.

The same study in contrasts occurs with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The bland, slightly stale tri-color chips seem out of place in a restaurant that serves such wonderfully fresh corn tortillas.  Taqueria Guadalajara serves two salsas with the chips.  The flavor-packed spicy version is expertly prepared while its milder sibling is a watery mess.

Once you get past the uneven performance of the kitchen, the performance of the restaurant shines.   

The expansive menu offers a vast variety of choices, including numerous vegetarian options.  Adventurous eaters can dine on pig stomachs or beef intestines while the kid's menu gives you the ability to feed the bambinos when you elect to bring them along.  On weekends, the restaurant offers pozole and menudo.  The generous serving sizes mean you will be toting a doggy bag when departing the restaurant.

I have enjoyed top-notch treatment during my visits.  While not overly gregarious, the servers are cordial and efficient.  Even when slammed with customers, I always receive water and complimentary chips and salsa within a couple minutes of being seated.  Also appreciated is how the servers keep a keen eye on the chip basket.  When the chip level starts running low, the server will promptly ask if the table if they want a refill.   They also consistently perform other service basics liking checking in after they deliver the food and promptly removing dirty dishes.  

For a mom-&-pop Mexican restaurant,  Taqueria Guadalajara gets a gold star for cleanliness.  The stainless steel open kitchen still gleans as it did when the restaurant reopened and the tabletops are always spotless.

The serving area is relatively small and there is scant space between the tables.  Eating during peak hours means it may be difficult to carry on a discussion with tablemates at conversational tones.  The dining room has the obligatory muted flat screen tuned to a Liga MX match or other Latin programming.

 Pro tip:  When perusing past reviews, be aware that a completely remodeled Taqueria Guadalajara reopened on August 8, 2013 after a fire closed the restaurant for over six months.  You should discount any comments about the gritty nature of the eatery before that date.

So if you find yourself travelling the South Park Street corridor with a heavy appetite and a light wallet, do not hesitate to pay Taqueria Guadalajara a visit."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"There must be a reason why these are listed as the first items in Taqueria Guadalajara's menu.  

Out of the extensive lists of Tex-Mex Mexican inspired items (burritos, enchiladas, etc) these are the truly authentic Mexican items in this taqueria.

The key item is the taco. What are they?  These are small soft corn tortillas with your choice of carne asada, pastor, chicken and if you happen to be truly adventurous even tongue.

Eat them like they do throughout Mexico. Asked them with a bunch of cilantro and onion, top it off with a glob of guacamole and a spoonful of the house hot sauce.  If you want them American style then you can always sub the cilantro for lettuce and tomatoes and even make them more American by adding cheese or sour cream.

In my book everything else at this taqueria is decoration. If you eat the tacos as described above you will step out of Taqueria Guadalajara as if you have just stepped out one of the best taqueria anywhere in Mexico.

After all the restaurant name says it all ""taqueria"" that translates closely as ""Tacos stall"" in Spanish.

If you have a sweet tooth drink a cold horchata, a cold Mexican CocaCola or a cerveza fria to ease down the incredible tacos.

TREMENDOS TACOS!

I rate this 5 star for value, freshness and for an authentic flavor of Mexico."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"On our way back from Chicago, we stopped here for some Mexican food.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  I had the PLATILLO GUADALAJARA
Steak, refried beans, cactus salad (nopales), fried onions, pico de gallo
and a deep-fried jalapeño. Served with warm tortillas.  My fiancée had the ENCHILADAS DE MOLE Two corn tortillas rolled and stuffed with chicken or cheese, covered with our homemade
mole sauce, melted cheese and sour cream. Served with rice and refried beans.  My dish won some awards and found the cactus salad to be very good.  It was nice to wrap my own tortillas with steak, beans, and cactus.  I was concerned about the spice but it was perfectly fine.  She like her dish as well and we were full and satisfied."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"GORDITA GORDITA GORDITA

get it! Chicken gordita. This is SO good. Think a traditional taco, but fried tortilla. and a little ""fatter"". 

Chicken taco - mexicano (cilantro + onion) - still a little bland (the chicken needs ""something"" in it).

Small space but they have 12 4-person tables. Bigger than expected. They have Jarritos and Victoria beer. 

Free chips and salsa - the mild is mild and the spicy is medium. Both very GREAT flavors."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Was visiting Madison for the Great Midwest Beer Fest and prior to getting in line for the opening we headed west a bit and via Yelp landed in this little Taqueria.  From the front it almost looks too small to dine-in as there are no tables and just a small counter.  But the server will lead you back, literally through the kitchen, to the dinning area in the back of the restaurant.

As we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't spend too much time searching the menu, quickly selecting a torta.

Our server brought some colored chips and two types of salsas; the chips were good but the salsa was nothing great.  The torta on the other hand was excellent, the steak was juicy and had a hint of grilled, smoky flavor.  The sandwich was huge and was more food then needed (had to save room for 5 hours worth of beer sampling)."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Always delicious and interesting food. Sometimes, my friends are really confused when they receive a taco with cilantro in it instead of cheese, beans and salsa -- all smothered with sour cream.

My favorite experience was the beef tongue tacos and the tripe tacos.  The tongue was incredibly soft and tasty and the the texture of the tripe was really unique and satisfying."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"We've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since moving from California.  And so far Taqueria Guadalajara is the best, hands down, of all the places we've tried.

We've been here twice.  On both visits we ordered the Burrito Mexicano, which is huge and has an excellent balance of meat, cheese, rice, and beans.  The salsa, sour cream, and guacamole on top (which helps create the colors of the Mexican flag) give it good additional flavor.  We've also ordered both times the tacos, which are also tasty--we've ordered the carne asada and pastor tacos.  Great meat flavor and greasy enough to add flavor but you won't have grease dripping down your arms.

We've also had the chicken and cheese tamales, which had good flavor but there wasn't a whole lot of filling inside (especially the cheese), and a sope with chicken, which was delicious with a thick corn tortilla that is crispy on the bottom but soft on top and delicious meat, again.

For our son, we ordered a kid's quesadilla which was alright.  The cheese wasn't melted, but I think they did that so that he didn't burn himself.  If that's the intention, then that was very nice of them.  Our son, as well as do I, loves the horchata, which is a sweet rice drink.  It was tasty and wasn't too thick with rice.  A little more cinnamon would be nice,  though.

And, to be honest, last time we went, I had read Brad R.'s review and was scared about getting food poisoning.  I probably hate being sick more than the average person, so I understand his warning.  However, as I let that thought leave my mind and focused on enjoying the food, I started to think: I'm sure that if you talk to enough people, you'll find someone who has gotten food poisoning or has had some horrible experience at EVERY restaurant there is.  If you want a surefire way to avoid food poisoning, you'll have to stay away from ALL hole-in-the-wall, but authentic places like this restaurant and go to Taco Bell or cook your own food and cook the hell out of everything.  Again, I believe Brad, and I feel bad for his experience, but at the same time, I think you've gotta have trust in a place and hope that you don't get sick."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,I'm ok with this place. I've actually only gone here a couple times after the rebuild after the fire damage. The food is quite good ranging from average to above average. It's light years ahead of some of the guck I had earlier from Fuzzy's Taco Shop yet I can't say I'd drive here over similar neighborhood tastes like El Pastor or La Hacienda. The reason this place won't get stars higher with me is honestly trhe seating and noise. It feels like I'm in some kind of lunch room in High School all over again when there are more people there. Everyone seems friendly and the servers are friendly but its strange for me to have a meal with people at my elbows that I don't know. The other issue I've come across there is cleanliness ranging from strange things floating in the water to finding a rubber band in the salsa.. It looked like something to just tie jalapenos or tomatos-not a hair band..but still.. I'm sure curiosity will drive me back here again in the future or will venture into a delivery option sometime again.
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"This is a ""5-star 1-star"" place. You know what I mean?

The food and decor really reminded me of real taco stands in Mexico. Cheap. Yummy. A breath of fresh air after all the terrible or pretentious Mexican food that I've eaten in Madison.

Real Mexican people eat here. Need I say more?"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Take out, delivery or dine in. Yummy 2$ tacos with add on options like avocado cheese and grilled onions. I've had steak and chicken which come with cilantro and onions. I wish they offered fish tacos as well. They make their gorditas in house. Offer two homemade salsas with their chip baskets- a mild and spicy one that is very unique. Offers authenticity at a great value."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I thought we had finally found an awesome neighborhood Mexican place, but nope, the food kind of sucked.  My gorditas tasted kind of old.  The steak was chewy and tasted kind of weird.  The burrito was bland and very soggy.  Aren't they supposed to fry it a little on the grill first?  

I feel bad saying it because the atmosphere was so cool.  It was little and cramped and the furniture was shitty.  There was a tv!  And like kids running around screaming who were somehow attached to the people running the place.  

Oh well, maybe they were having an off night or something"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Given that there are already over 200 reviews for this place, I doubt I will add anything of value. That being said I love this place and would like to support it's fantastic food and service in any fashion possible.

I've said it in other reviews, unfortunately there isn't a depth in diversity of dining in Madison. This is one place that helps solve this issue. Taqueria Guadalajara offers authentic Mexican food in a laid back atmosphere and with warm, friendly service.

As many reviewers have already elaborated, this place is packed at peak times. Luckily service is so fast that waiting doesn't exceed past twenty minutes per party.

When I do go here, I have a tendency to order the same thing over and over again, the steak chimichanga.  I see a lot of people order variety though, including a various assortment of foods with Verde sauce, breakfast, etc... 

All food is made fresh and to order. This is a point of distinction between this taqueria and others in Madison. A clear example is that the steak is made for burritos, tacos, etc. in small batches to satisfy the orders needing steak. At other places, the steak will be made every few hours and will be allowed to sit around. This makes all the difference in taste of freshness and providing restaurant quality. The produce is also prepared in fresh as well every few hours. The tastes are very reflective of going to a classic place in Mexico and asking for a particular food.

The price, friendly staff, and great quality simply has no rival in Madison.

Oh and they also have Mexican cokes, horchata, Jarritos, and a few beers for selection - a nice touch."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Fast and friendly service.  Clean and affordable.  I had the carne asada and pastor Tacos and a side of Orden de cebollitas cambray.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the taco meat had been better seasoned.  The pastor was not bad, but the steak was very bland.  Everyone I was with seemed pleased with their meal and my husband said we could come back for sure (he is kind of picky). He had the steak quesadilla plate."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"In the famous words of Chuck D and Flavor Flave ""don't believe the hype.""

For years our friends of been raving about this place.  We have heard people call this the ""best Mexican restaurant in Madison"" and other people call it the ""absolute best Mexican food period.""   So after a couple years of wanting to try this place...we finally did.

I cannot complain about the aesthetics...it is a cute little place without all the traditional bright colors....but thats where the good ends.

FIRST OFF:   How can you have a Mexican Restaurant that does not serve Margaritas?    Really?   When I want to devour a burritos I want some Tequila and Lime to go with it.   Even if it is the pre-made junk.

SECOND:  The food was bland.....about as bland as bland can be.   My wife ordered a Chicken Quesadilla as she always does at Mexican restaurant and it literally had ZERO taste.    Heck she had to use all of the salsa form the chips to even remotely get a flavor to it.   Oh...and speaking of chips....they are complete straight out of the bag store bought terrible chips.  Even Laredo's has better chips....well...actually they have better food all together and that is saying a lot!

THRID:  Lets talk my burrito.   I decided to go a different route than my normal fajitas or taco salad and got myself a steak burrito.   OMG....this this was.....TERRIBLE!   The steak was as hard as a rock.  The burrito itself was even more bland than my wife's quesadilla and literally had NO TASTE AT ALL.   Worst part is she stole all the salsa and it took the rest of the meal to get more.

So...when heading up Park street and wanting Mexican food this place is a joke.   Traditional....sure but tasteless traditional and just...I would rather eat at Taco Bell."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Still haven't dropped the ball. Been going here for years now. Mi Ranchero is my favorite, Chorizo, Steak, Grilled Cactus and whole grilled onions. It brings back memories of Oaxaca, warm nights & Modelo Negro."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Favorites include cheese mole enchiladas and platilo guatelahara  which includes thinly grilled steak, fried jalepeno, onions, beans and nopale salad...mmmm so good."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Upon further review... if it were between Taqueria el Asadero in Chicago and Taqueria Guadalajara in Madison, Asadero would win every time when it came to steak tacos, steak burritos or any other item containing steak. Otherwise, Guadalajara would win on every other dimension."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"""Mexican food"" is such a loose term in Madison. Some people think that Pedro's or Laredos are good places to find the elusive, delicious and authentic fare but they'd be wrong. If I can hear the staff speaking in mostly English then I know the food won't be what I'm looking for. If my tacos come with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream then I'm looking for the nearest salida.

Taqueria Guadalajara is hands-down the best place to find authentic and tasty Mexican food. 

They do it right: fast, friendly service, authentic meals and a very reasonable, if not underpriced, price point. This place is a home run and it's somewhat unassuming from the outside. I haven't had a single item from the menu that didn't make me want to keep eating. This place is the epitome of Mexico. Come here and eat some good food but don't be ""that guy"" and order flour tortillas. That's what Taco Bell is for."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Oh my goodness....I love love love this place!! I've been trying to find good enchiladas and chile relleno since I moved and came to Wisconsin and they have both. The food was hot and fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful. My husband enjoyed the steak tacos. They give you two types of salsa with tortilla chips when you are seated ...one was very hot but both were tasty. Qdoba, Chipotle are fast food compared to this place and I can't even go in those places with a straight face after going to this Taqueria. I will definitely be returning!!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"1416. In case you were wondering that's how many miles it is from the Madison to the border of Mexico. You could drive that, or just dine right here in Madison for authentic Mexican cuisine. 

I want to paint a picture in your mind. You are driving down Park street and you see this very small looking building out your window with a name you can't pronounce. Unless you found it on yelp and were searching for it you might miss it.  You walk in and see an open kitchen, a dinner style bar for guest, and a back dining room.  The smell hits your nose like the first flower of spring. You can see the fresh ingredients being used, you can see them cooking everything.  You have arrived at Taqueria Guadalajara.

Everything about my lunch here was top notch. The price, the food, the friendliness when I pronounced a dish wrong. Even the fresh salsa and tri-colored tortilla chips they give you as soon as you sit down. Let's do the Durley breakdown. 

Food: Trying to pick something was the hardest thing I've done all week. I settled on two tacos and the chilli relleno. 
Tacos: I ordered one tripa (intestine) and one Lengua (beer tongue) Onions and fresh cilantro were topped on both with a double warm, homemade, yes that's right homemade, corn tortilla. (Very important to me that they used corn and not flour) The meat on both tacos was so juicy and flavorful. I was really impressed with the Lengua. I strongly recommend you try it. Seriously, get out of your comfort zone and put some tongue on your tongue!  
Chilli Relleno: This was a good sized plate for the price. One chilli, a side of beans, Mexican rice,  and lettuce,tomatoes. The chilli itself was cooked to perfection and the filling? Oh my, oh my, oh my. Topped off with the homemade sauce.... Can I just move into the basement please? The beans were great. More refried beans style but a little runny so they stayed moist. The rice was not dry at all which was a huge plus, not over or undercooked, just the way momma use to make it ;) 

Drinks: Soda, imported beer, specialty drinks, and of course, my favorite soda, pineapple Jarrito. 

Price: This is the best part. Its so inexpensive for the quality of ingredients. 
Taco ~ $2
Chilli Relleno ~ $7 

I strongly encourage you to try this fabulous place if you want some authentic Mexican cuisine without driving 1,416 miles."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"To be honest, I was a little bit ""weary"" of this place.  $2 tacos, good quality food? Seemed wayyyy too good to be true. NOPE! This place is AMAZING! Even my friend who generally doesn't like Mexican food, she enjoyed her food here!!! I came here with a group of friends and they first served us their unlimited chips and salsas. All of which tasted great, great flavors, good amount of spice, and unlimited!!! I ordered a Huarache with Intestine, and a pork stomach taco.  For $7, the huarache was definitely worth it. Piled high with veggies, and given a generous amount of GOOD QUALITY meat, I was absolutely satisfied, and super full.   The taco was great too, two corn tortillas with good quality toppings.  I was so happy with all the food I ate here, and surprised by the price and quality (in a good way of course).  I would DEFINITELY recommend this place :)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"By far the best Mexican food I've ever had! Don't let the exterior of the building turn you away...the pink paint makes it look a little sketchy, but the taste of the food put out by this kitchen is off the charts.

To start with, there are 2 kinds of salsa that are really good. Then, I had the Huaraches with steak...so good! My boyfriend ate a chicken chimichanga..best chimichanga either of us has ever tried! The portion sizes are huge, and the prices are really good. Definitely a place I will visit again when I'm in the area!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I come from California, so I've had my fair share of excellent Mexican food, and Taqueria Guadalajara is definitely on par with some of the best Mexican food I've had.

My favorite item here is straightforward: steak tacos. Fresh, soft corn tortillas packed with fresh seasoned steak, onions, cilantro, and lime. It's heaven, plain and simple. Their other meats are of course excellent as well, chicken and chorizo are my other favorites, but seriously, I wouldn't mind only eating their steak tacos for the rest of my life. Would also recommend a horchata to go along with your meal. Many places in California are guilty of diluting their horchatas, but not in Wisconsin! 

Ever since finding out about this place, I now go every week, usually twice when I'm desperate, and always sit at the counter. Always amazing service, and amazing food. Will continue to go here every week while I'm in Madison."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"This place isn't the best restaurant in Madison.

It's not even the best Mexican restaurant in Madison.

Best Mexican-Restaurant-Housed-In-An-Obnoxiously-Pink-Building?

I think we can safely give it that.

A work colleague and I were in downtown Madison the other day and looking for a place to have lunch.  Usually when we want Mexican and are a bit further west La Guanajuatence is our go-to place.  Being further east I scoured Yelp and found that Guadalajara was likely our best bet.

We were not disappointed.

I just want to say that this is only a four-star review because the previously mentioned place got five-stars from me and Guadalajara was just not quite as good.

In every other way other than direct comparison it was spectacular.  I had a chicken sope and a three-pack of tacos.  One tripe, one tongue, and one el pastor.  My colleague had a pork chimichanga.  Obviously, we both had chips and salsa + Mexican coke.

Chips and salsa were good.  I see other reviewers rave about them, but I really thought they were only okay.  La Guanajuatence has a salsa BUFFET w/ fifteen salsas.  You really can't compare the two.

Tacos were GREAT.  The tripe taco was the best thing I've eaten yet this year.  It's probably better than anything I ate most of last year.  Crunchy one one side and soft and unctuous on the other.  It was the highlight of my week, seriously.  So so so good.  Everything else was delish as well.  The sope was chewy and thick and cheesy and delicious.  W/ a little of the hot salsa from the chips on top it was just what I needed to top off the meal.

Service was awesome.  We were on a tight schedule, let the waitress know this and were in/out w/in thirty minutes of placing our order.

I really enjoyed this place and will go again w/out hesitation if we're in the area.

That said, since I gave La Guanajuatence five-stars I don't see how I can give this place the same rating.

Four Stars from me, but go yourself because it's probably five-stars good."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,I love this place! One of the BEST taco places in Madison. You can pick anything on their menu and it will be delicious! This is a great place to sample the menu with a friend.
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I live six blocks away, but its natty exterior scared me off. The other day, I scoped Mexican restaurants and this came very highly rated. 

As we walked in (with my 11-year-old), it was clean and rustic (another word for an outdated and sparse sh*thole). The clientele combined many Hispanics casually speaking Spanish (big plus) and face-filled Caucasians. Within 10 seconds of seating, we had a bowlful of chips and fresh mild / hot salsa and very pleasant greeting from the server.    

Opening the menu, they filled the pages with Mexican perfection. We're a little adventurous (me more so than my 11-year-old) and was excited by the menu items of tripe, tongue and cactus. OMG, right!?!?! Those items are only found in a Taco Bell entree by freak accident. 

Don't worry, there are many conventional items as well. 

Chowing on chips, we slugged a couple of Jarrito sodas (I had tamarind and he had lime). Before 10 minutes passed, our burritos came. He had beef and I had seasoned pork steak (carne el pastor). While digging in mine, I had to nibble on his too. Both were incredible; the meat was tender and delicious and included sides were refried beans (perfectly seasoned, cooked and homemade) and delicious rice (slightly smoked and cooked to perfection). We were in such delight, I do not know we recalled breathing.

To go, we picked a beef tongue taco (he would not promise to resist French-kissing the taco); Platillo Guadalajara (special with steak, chile and cactus); chimichanga (MASSIVE); tamale dinne and  two Cokes (glass bottle) for UNDER $50! 

Before I typed this up, I sampled the plates and the food is consistent. All the food is homemade, filling and perfectly textured/seasoned. 

I feel like such and idiot for holding out on this joint."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Can't believe I haven't written a review yet.

This place has the best Mexican food I've found so far in Madison (I've had better elsewhere, but it really is quite good for serving white bread Wisconsinites) and they are quite affordable!

SO sticks with the Lomo de Puerco en Salsa Verde every time, tender with a nice heat. I jump around and have tried a variety of taco, burrito, quesadilla, and platillo combinations. I recommend pork for your choice of meat, flavorful but not tough or stringy. Definitely try a horchata, Mexican Coke, or Jarritos with your meal. Tamarind Jarritos is my favorite.

The place is small, with a pick up spot and small counter in front, with maybe 10 tables in the back. I recommend an early lunch/dinner especially if you want a meal on the weekends (!!) so you don't have to wait in the cramped space up front (the line extends outside even during winter..). Thankfully food comes out pretty fast and you get free salsa and chips to curb your hunger pangs."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Ordered a grilled steak burrito for delivery and when I got it there was no steak.  The delivery service (Eats24) contacted the restaurant and said for sure there was steak in the burrito... so I guess the customer who's eating it is wrong!  What a joke, food was at best average otherwise.  Won't recommend this place to anyone."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I was browsing through my Bucky Book when I found a coupon that said ""two free tacos."" I thought well I do like Mexican food s, so why not? I went down about 11:30 and sat right at the counter in front. They instantly hand me a menu and ask me what I'd like to drink. I tell them Coca Cola, they bring me a glass bottle. I order my two tacos, one steak, and one chicken. 

After I order a guy walks in and sits two seats down, he looks familiar.... I see his name tag on his shirt. It's Chris Rickert the columnist from Wisconsin State Journal. Mr. Rickert was there to interview the owners about the redevelopment of the Park Street area near Fish Hatchery Road. Turns out the owners of the restaurant just bought the building yesterday... She said she is not going anywhere and her family loves Madison. I earned myself as little spot in the article as Chris and I started talking about his columns and the food. 

Chris and I came to a determination, Taqueria Guadalajara is the best Mexican food in town. Service was great and food tasted very fresh. I will be back for sure, also prices are awesome $1.75 for a taco!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"This place is everything that has been described. Small, authentic, shabby looking, iffy service.

It was a little hard to find parking, but I guess that is not an uncommon problem in Madison. They advertise they serve mixed drinks but they don't. They don't even have margaritas. 

I got the Mexican Burrito and a veggie taco. The burrito was kinda bland, possibly would have tasted better with meat in it but I was less than impressed. The veggie taco was much tastier and wished I had gone that route instead.

It was also kinda hot in there but I guess air conditioning isn't common in Madison since it stays cold most of the year. I may consider going back there again but I wasn't completely sold."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Wow, is this place great!
I was a little apprehensive when my boyfriend showed me his favorite Mexican joint in Madison--it definately looks like a dive.  But he loves food and so do I, plus I read all of the previous reviews, and gave it a shot.
Walking in was a bit... icky? It is not the cleanest or nicest place-at all, but we were greeted by smiling faces.  Space is limited here and we sat at the ""bar"" which is really where the cooking is going on, which is nice because you can watch them prepare your food.

I got 2 vegetarian tacos and a potato chalupa. Oh, and a tangerine Jarritos!  Oh my goodness, it was all so great and SO cheap.  The tacos are $1.75 each and chalupa $2.50 (I think).  My boyfriend got chicken enchiladas which he had never had and loved as well
Plus, the chips and salsa werer really good (minus the fact that they were replenished by a gloveless boy :/).

If you can get over the clean factor, this place is amazing.  4 stars b/c of the no glove thing, but the food is super good and very fast.  I will definately come here if I want fast Mexican instead of taco bell lol.  

AND my bf said they have outdoor seating in the summer! Yay!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Qualifications:  Resident of San Diego for 4 years, frequenter of Taco Shops.

Quick synopsis:  Highly Recommended, great food great prices.  Will go back soon.

We had a group of 4 total, one of which is an 11 month old baby, for lunch around 1:30 on a Saturday.  We sat at a table pretty quickly however the 2 baby seats were taken.  By the time were were leaving every available seat was taken.  To start they brought out some chips and salsa.  The chips were regular but the salsa's were home made and fantastic.  There was a red and a picante.  I bought a cup of the picante for $4 to take home, it was pretty much the perfect spiciness.  

Between us all we order Chile Relleno, Taco Dinner, Veggie Sopa, Chicken Enchilada, and a Chicken Taco.  My order was the Relleno and for $7 I couldn't expect anything more.  Rice, re-fried beans, lettuce, tomato, the chile, and 5 corn tortillas.  I was really stoked on the tortillas because usually a place only gives you like 2.  Everything on the dish was very good.  I was actually really surprised on how tasty the chile was.  It came with a ""traditional red sauce"" on it that complimented it really nicely.  I am a pretty big eater and was satisfied after I was done.  

My baby had the chicken taco for $2.  She can't talk but we are pretty sure she loved it.  We were really happy that there was something so simple on the menu we could offer her.  I finished off what she didn't eat and I thought the shredded chicken had a great flavor and was tender.  My wife got the taco dinner that came with beans and rice.  It came with 2 tacos carne and pork.  She said she really liked the carne but the pork was pretty standard.  She wanted to specifically note that the tortillas were fantastic, I agree.

Mother in law got the Sopa ($3) and Enchilada ($7).  I had a bite of each.  I haven't eaten too much sopa but it was absulutely delishes, I like to call it an open faced tamale.  Her burrito was covered in a green sauce that had quite a nice flavor, you could really taste the pepper in it.  MIL said they were really good and the value for the price was excellent.

I wish I could give out fractions of stars because I don't really like giving out 5 unless it totally blows me away.  I would give them at least 4.5 though.  It exceeded our expectations, which started high, and the prices were very good.  The dining area isn't very large so if you have a big group I would probably stay away.  But for a family I think it was perfect.  Nice moderate ambient noise to keep baby happy and great food for dad."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"A bunch of my friends and I had been meaning to try out this place because it is so close to where I live, usually looks busy, and we are curious people. We finally got around to it last night, and it was the best homemade Mexican food I have had yet in Madison!

The front part has a dining counter with a grill, which looked inviting, but we sat in the back part of the restaurant with tables. The two salsas they serve before the meal are great - although the green salsa was a bit more spicy than I prefer, it was still delicious, and I'm sure people with a higher tolerance for heat would absolutely love it.
  
I had a burrito mexicano (which comes with mild red salsa, sour cream and guacamole spread on the top to look like a Mexican flag) with steak. It tasted far better than any burrito I'd had in recent memory. I was surprised at how few beans were in it, but it may have been because the two people I was with ordered theirs with no beans and they came back a couple of times to make sure they had our order correct. I was happy with the staff there for that very reason and also because they were just pleasant to begin with.

For what you get, there's no beating the price, either :) I will definitely be back for more!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Hands down my favorite mexican restuarant in Madison.   I can't speak highly enough of the staff or food.   My favorite is the the chile relleno.   Their flan has a smooth consistency that is often missing from that desert.   On top of that the small items- tacoes, at are great a great deal.  They don't serve tex-mex so don't go in expecting taco bell.  :)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"FINALLY! I found good carry-out mexican food in Madison. I usually go to La Hacienda out of old college day habits of seeking cheap cheap cheap mexican food. Lately, I've been seeking something better like I got used to while living in San Diego...Guadalajara was pretty close. I went to Francisco's first, but they were closed on Sundays (they did have a sign in the window ""$10 margarita pitchers"" so I have a feeling my straw and I will eventually try it out).

I got a burrito which was outstanding and only $6. My only complaints were that the cheese was melted on the exterior (making it hard to eat w/o a fork and knife), it was zapped in the microwave (unnecessary if the cheese was placed inside), and the lady was trying to be skimpy on the salsa (I wanted to try it all). 

Everyone was speaking Spanish, it was extremely quick, the staff was very friendly, all the other food going out looked great, the place seemed clean despite its quirky late night drunken Cabo taco shop appearance and the salsa was really good in my opinion. 

I can't wait to go back!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I stopped in for breakfast before the Great Taste. I was trying to find a Mexican part of town, and just happened to see the pink house looking building.  I could not have done better. 
 This is real Mexican food. A small joint, devoid of gimmicks and frills. The staff was super friendly, and there was a soccer game on tv. You know you have found a decent place to eat when they lead you through the (tiny, but clean) kitchen to your table. 
 I had a steak huarache and a lengua taco, and they were deliciously devoid of the massive piles of melted cheese some places use to hide the fact that their food sucks. 
 This is the good stuff. Fresh and bright flavors for a great price. I will make a point to stop here anytime I am in the area."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Best Mexican food I've had in Madison by a very, very long shot!  

This is not the sort of place you go for the ambiance.  It's teeny, cramped, and hot, and loudish cheesy music videos were blaring from a television.  But honestly, who the heck cares when you're eating food this good?

Admittedly, my first dining experience (two or three years ago) at Taqueria Guadalajara was sort of meh -- I had the Burrito Mexicano (the one that looks like a Mexican flag!) and it was just okay.  But my second meal was so delicious that I'm thinking that the first must've been an off evening or something (for me or for them).  I had the chicken tacos, and even though it was just seasoned chicken and lettuce in a corn tortilla, it was absolutely delicious.  No dry chicken here, no sir.  My boyfriend got a pork taco (super freaking good -- I'll be getting this when I go back), a tongue taco (also very good but I personally can't get over the whole I'm-eating-something's-tongue thing) and a vegetarian sope which was just fried heaven.  I do wish they had soda from a fountain rather than in cans, but really, a minor complaint.

All that yum for $13.50?  You'd better believe I'll be back.  Soon.  And often."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"It was taco Tuesday and I decided to eat here for the first time.  Before I review the restaurant I would like to talk about tacos....and food in general.  
I LOVE tacos.  
I could eat them more than once a day...and I have (don't judge)!  In my mind there are two types of tacos.  Regular tacos and craft tacos...or fusion...new age...call them whatever you like.  Designer tacos...ok...ok....anywayz....I'm not going to walk into a restaurant like Taqueria Guadalajara and expect tacos like El Dorado Grill just like I'm not going to walk into Glass Nickel and expect pizza like Pizza Brutta.  It's important to know the restaurant BEFORE you go.  I hate all the reviews that say ""meh...it was okay...but nothing outstanding"".  What??

To the restaurant~  I had 4....count 'em....4 tacos.....2 carne asada (steak) and 2 pastor (marinated pork).  They were delicious.  My partner had a chicken quesadilla with beans and rice.  Her's was delicious and she ate all her beans and rice!!  It was what we expected.  I like this place....the food is good....inexpensive....the service was great....they sell beer although we both had diet pepsi...and we had fun."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I can see why this place is loved. They make their food with love. It's authentic alright. I still prefer Casa del Sol and Laredo's any day tho. The salsa is tasty but full of chunks and the really hot salsa is just that, reallllllllllly hot. Too hot to enjoy. But the chimichanga and the steak quesadilla were delicious. Juicy, shredded chicken, buttery quesadilla, great guacamole for only $2! Just watch out for bones in the chicken. I crunched into a large one. Almost made me lose my appetite. Food was too good to stop eating tho. I decided not to mention the bone because I just wanted to have a good time without any drama. I'm not afraid to mention it here tho, just as a warning to you all. Chew carefully and enjoy!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"I'm new to Madison and have been CRAVING tacos for the past month.  I stopped in for the first time last night on the recommendation of a good friend, and am I glad he told me about this place.

Firstly, the atmosphere is GREAT.  I love the the small, cramped, homey feeling of the restaurant.  The fact that it's a converted house gives it extra character.  You walk in and there's barely enough room for a table, let alone customers. 

I had steak, chicken and pork tacos with rice and beans.  Topped with fresh cilantro and onions and paired with a Dos Equis, it's just what I needed to finish off a lazy Sunday.  

Did I mention it's CHEAP!  I'll definitely be satisfying my taco cravings here again soon."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak taco,"Probably the best kept secret in Madison.  If you think you like Mexican you haven't seen anything yet.  Go here and you'll never eat faux Mexican (i.e. Taco Bell, Chipotle, etc.) ever again.  You can get a seat at the bar and watch them cook the food right in front of you with Telemundo playing in the background.  This place is authentic Mexican food and the people are very nice.  I am a fan of the sopes and their cow tongue is pretty tasty too."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"This is one of those true Yelp success stories.

I grew up mostly in Madison but lived in Milwaukee for a number of years where Mexican food is ridiculously good.  Whether it be from one of the amazing restaurants on the Southside or the authentic Mexcian grocers (El Ray), you really can't go wrong.  Up until I went to Taqueria, I hadn't run into a restaurant in Madison that I would even deem ""acceptable"" for Mexican food.

There's a few places that were decent, but nothing that ever stuck out or that had all the right stuff put together.  Each place lacked either taste, proper pricing, or variety on their menu.

Well Taqueria Guadalajara solves that issue ten-fold in my opinion.  They are pretty much just what others describe here; a very very small mom & pop operation with a comfortable environment and amazing food at good prices.  Portion sizes are also quite generous.  The staff is polite and the TV usually has either soccer or mexican soap operas on, adding to the authentic vibe.

The food needs to be emphasized here though, they have some fantastic options.  First off, the chips and salsas are tasty, they give you a hot blend which I found enjoyable and a mild blend which is has a very traditional taste (cilantro, tomatoes, etc).  Make sure though that you order Guacamole, even if it takes them a while to bring it out.  Their fresh homemade Guac is out of this world, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't even like Guacamole.  I have to put it on everything I get here though, as it's just that delicious.

Secondly, there are a few main dishes I've had worthy of note.  I'd say the best deal they offer are the tacos, my girlfriend got 2-3 tacos each time with a side, and I think they were about $1.75 or $2 per taco.  This isn't something from taco bell though, these are flavorful and fulfilling jam-packed tortillas, and if you get a side of rice and / or beans it should be more than enough food.  Some of my other favorites, albeit pricey, are the Mexican flag burrito and the Tortas (Mexican Sandwhiches) with slow-roasted pulled pork.  I'd rate one meat over the other, but the Carne Asada, the el pastor pulled pork, and the chicken were all mouth-watering.  Just make sure you wash it down with one of their many beers / sodas available.

Nobody's perfect, so there are a few minor qualms.  The service is terribly slow and inattentive.  They make up for it with warm hospitality, but we often had to wait for drink / chip refills to the point where we had finished the main course and usually had to wait a while to put in our order.  That said, they do get the main courses out promptly, the last time I went I had my meal in less than ten minutes.  Only thing is, we've seen this behavior when we went at 8pm at night on a weekday, so I have no idea how it is when they're packed.  My girlfriend said she went for lunch and it was crazy-crowded (she still got her food though).

Overall, Taqueria is a slice of delight in an unexpected location."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Not the place to go if decor is important to you.  After walking through the kitchen to get to the tables with mismatched chairs in the back, my BF and I suspected we were in for some tasty food and we were not disappointed! 

I had a huarche al pastor- sort of an open faced burrito with pork and he had the enchiladas verde.  Both of us completely cleaned our plates, and even with a generous tip the total was at least half of what we might spend at a nicer place with lesser quality food. We will be going back for sure!!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Great authentic Mexican food.  Small place but worth the wait if there is one. Tried the burrito, tacos and enchilada. All excellent.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Then enchilada was crispy. The way it should be. Both salsas were excellent. Just wish there were margaritas,  but i understand....laws."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"We had a really good dinner here and will definitely be back. It is a small place, but there is seating in the back, so do try it. We were there early and got right in, but it was filling up by the time we left. I had the chicken enchiladas verde and my dining companion had the burrito mexicana. Prior to our entrees they brought us chips and two different salsas. I am a fan of heat, so I loved them both, but the hotter of the two maybe too intense for some. Our dinners came with rice and beans, and they there both delicious! Everyone that waited on us was pleasant and cordial. After we got there we noticed they prefer cash because of the service charge, and I felt bad we only had a card. Note to self next time bring cash. I love frequenting local places, and this is one we will definitely be back to. Tasty, flavorful food and good prices."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"What a little hole in the wall gem on Park St.! I've heard a lot of buzz about this place in the past, but this is my first time. It's quant and authentic in decor; I like the mix of Badger memorabilia and vibrant yellow, pink, and teal Mexican color scheme. 

I got the enchiladas mole with chicken. I don't think this mole had a chocolate base, but there were definitely notes of cinnamon that showed. Served with a side of beans and rice, this traditional dish was a big eat for only $7! 

My dad got the Platillo Guadalajara, featuring steak, refried beans, pico de gallo, a grilled jalapeño (caution: very spicy!!), and a grilled cactus salad. I've never had cactus before, but it was tangy and tasted pickled...I liked it! 

I would come back just for the complementary verde salsa and chips. It was a smoky flavor, and I couldn't stop eating it! Large portions, definitely a leftover kind of joint. Would be good to-go food too. Yum!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"My favorite a la carte Mexican restaurant in Madison is back, with a fresh new coat of paint and the same familiar vibe. My favorite dish went up in price and was renamed to Platillo Guadalajara, but it's still the same fatty thin-sliced steak with crispy ends goodness. I like to eat half the plate with corn tortillas and pack the rest away for tomorrow's lunch. 

It can be fun to watch the kitchen bustle at the counter seats, but you'll definitely leave smelling like tortillas and onions. The spacious room in the back is usually filled with couples and families during lunch on the weekends. Taqueria Guadalajara is on its way to becoming a Madisonian institution."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"DON'T LET THE SHADY PINK BUILDING FOOL YOU! YELP helped me discover this hidden gem. The food was super good and super authentic. I found my inner fatman while I was here and sampled two tacos, a gordita, and sope. The TACOS were to die for. By far MY FAVORITE. I had one steak and one pork. DELICIOUS! The SOPE and GORDITA were just more of the same goodness in a fried tortilla. Super Good, and Super Cheap. Check it out!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,Absolutely fantastic food! I had the chimichanga with steak and my husband had the burrito Mexicano. Both were very good and I don't think I've ever had a better chimichanga in my life! The horchada is also very creamy and flavorful. Our new Mexican restaurant favorite!
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Dam it, I picked another place for lunch which was very popular and a line waiting to get a table. We would wait about 25 minutes while watching how the well oiled staff handled the onslaught that was in full action.

The place is small with a bar area in the front and a small dining room in the back. The place had colorful fresh looking walls with open duct work on the ceiling. The tables and chairs are cheap cafeteria style placed in the room.

I was worried when I opened the menu and nothing it was more than $11 and change. I would have the taco dinner for a whopping $7 which was steak and pork with a Negra Mondelo.

The chips and salsa were complementary and filled at least twice while we were there. The salsa was standard but the green was the hot one with better flavor. The chips were commercial tri color but did do the job.

The tacos were very good I must say for $7. They were my kind, meat, cilantro and onions. The corn tortillas had great flavor and cooked perfect on the flat top grill, just in the middle of soft to hard with flexibility left in them. The steak was flavorful and slightly seasoned. The pastor was melt in your mouth tender, i sampled the meats before I put the salsa on them and ate them. The beans were thick and lumpy with onions in them which I liked. The rice as usual does nothing for me. Not one mystery gristle or fat chunks in the meat so they trim the meat well.

Over all for price vs quality this is a solid joint. The tacos were very good and I can see why people wait in line for the place. We had to wait in line to pay on my way out so line in and line out. For price vs quality vs value there cant possibly be anything better and my only problem was no margarita on the menu to complete the whole experience. I wish this was in my neighborhood because I don't anything even close but I'm glad I we stopped by."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"This place is really good, not just 'good for wisconson' or 'good for suburb mexican', It's straight up good. I only had a steak burrito and some guacamole but both were delicious and the guys here were nice. Everything tastes fresh and authentic. Reminds me of Chicago."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"It's easy to miss this place when driving by. It's such a small place, but the food is great. I ordered a wet burrito with chicken and 2 tacos (1 carne asada, 1 beef tongue). Yep, you read it right, beef tongue. All the food was fresh, authentic, and most importantly, delicious! I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I am a little disappointed after dining in this week. Service isn't quite as friendly, good, or efficient as it used to be. They literally give you two tablespoons of salsa on first pour, with a few chips. My husband ordered a steak dish that was mostly onion and a few pieces of sparse steak. It looked nothing like the picture. Everything tastes good, it just seems they are getting skimpy on ingredients. I hope that changes soon, as competition is heating up for tacos in Madison! I won't abandon this place, but it might want to revisit its business plan. If they can't keep up with the costs, the menu could stand to go up in price just a tad to make up for it. I'll see how it goes next time."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Very good, but not the best in Madison. Great steak and pork tacos, with the tortillas cooked in griddle grease. Yum. Decent torta though it's covered in margarine. Definitely worth a visit. 

The only thing is that this place is really dirty and grimy. It qualifies as 'beyond-dive' in that way, though everything is cooked out in the open and in front of you and seems professional enough. Why not just mop the floors once in a while?"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Mi amor...how did I not review you earlier, Guadalajara?
Have been going here since it first opened and it's really exciting to see it flourish!

Chips are now served with both a mild red salsa and a quite hot green salsa.  The tacos and gorditas are the best with either steak (carne) or carnitas (pork), in my opinion.  The gorditas are just steaming hot pockets of deliciousness with refried beans, meat, and cheese.  They do have some vegetarian options on their menu as well.  The guac is the one item that's kind of ""eh"" since it's overly pureed rather than with big chunks.

If you have a group of 4-5, you can order the parrillada, which is an assortment of sausage crumbles, pork al pastor, thinly sliced potatoes, and green onions& potatoes.  All of this is served with rice, beans, guacamole, pepper mix, and tortillas, and it'll feed a crowd!

Love going here, always satisfied with the food, and it's great to see the same friendly faces when you go."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I haven't had good Mexican food in Madison since I first started visiting in 2009, so I was excited to try this place that some local Madison friends enjoy. Guadalajara Taqueria is a small restaurant with a counter for maybe five people and seating in the back with maybe 8 tables. We got seated around 6pm on a Tuesday evening, and the places was packed with a line by the time we left.

Like many taquerias, we were served chips and salsa when we sat down at our table. The chips were kind of fun because they were red, green, and yellow, and the salsa was good, but nothing outstanding. Our chips were refilled when we finished them.

I ordered a burrito mexicana with carne asada. It was a standard burrito on the inside with salsa, guacamole, and sour cream covering the top to visually look like the Mexican flag. Creative! The burrito was good, though what I crave is a San Francisco super burrito.

We also ordered a side of nopales (cactus) and grilled jalapeños. I enjoyed both.

I give this place four stars for Madison, but if it were in California, it'd get three stars."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"There is much to like about Taqueria Guadalajara 2.0: the service is efficient, the menu extensive and you get incredible bang for the buck.  I like but not love the food; there are sub-par elements of any meal juxtaposed against some near transcendent elements.  While not my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, it is certainly in the conversation.

The Parrillada that my table ordered during my last visit to Taqueria Guadalajara exemplifies uneven performance of the kitchen.  This dish for four consists of various Mexican grilled meats, roasted potatoes, knob onions, deep-fried jalapeños and grilled cactus.  The steak and rib meat was superb, with a char on the exterior but not overcooked. The same goes for the slightly sweet knob onions, which helped balance out the pile of unctuous grilled meat.  And the oh-so-wonderful corn tortillas served on the side were thick, fresh and loaded with flavor.  On the flip side, the overcooked chorizo added a crunchy element the dish did not need.  The potatoes could provide that textural component if properly prepared, but instead, the limp, under-seasoned spuds seemed out of place, considering the generous pile of starchy Mexican rice served on the side.

The same study in contrasts occurs with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The bland, slightly stale tri-color chips seem out of place in a restaurant that serves such wonderfully fresh corn tortillas.  Taqueria Guadalajara serves two salsas with the chips.  The flavor-packed spicy version is expertly prepared while its milder sibling is a watery mess.

Once you get past the uneven performance of the kitchen, the performance of the restaurant shines.   

The expansive menu offers a vast variety of choices, including numerous vegetarian options.  Adventurous eaters can dine on pig stomachs or beef intestines while the kid's menu gives you the ability to feed the bambinos when you elect to bring them along.  On weekends, the restaurant offers pozole and menudo.  The generous serving sizes mean you will be toting a doggy bag when departing the restaurant.

I have enjoyed top-notch treatment during my visits.  While not overly gregarious, the servers are cordial and efficient.  Even when slammed with customers, I always receive water and complimentary chips and salsa within a couple minutes of being seated.  Also appreciated is how the servers keep a keen eye on the chip basket.  When the chip level starts running low, the server will promptly ask if the table if they want a refill.   They also consistently perform other service basics liking checking in after they deliver the food and promptly removing dirty dishes.  

For a mom-&-pop Mexican restaurant,  Taqueria Guadalajara gets a gold star for cleanliness.  The stainless steel open kitchen still gleans as it did when the restaurant reopened and the tabletops are always spotless.

The serving area is relatively small and there is scant space between the tables.  Eating during peak hours means it may be difficult to carry on a discussion with tablemates at conversational tones.  The dining room has the obligatory muted flat screen tuned to a Liga MX match or other Latin programming.

 Pro tip:  When perusing past reviews, be aware that a completely remodeled Taqueria Guadalajara reopened on August 8, 2013 after a fire closed the restaurant for over six months.  You should discount any comments about the gritty nature of the eatery before that date.

So if you find yourself travelling the South Park Street corridor with a heavy appetite and a light wallet, do not hesitate to pay Taqueria Guadalajara a visit."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"On our way back from Chicago, we stopped here for some Mexican food.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  I had the PLATILLO GUADALAJARA
Steak, refried beans, cactus salad (nopales), fried onions, pico de gallo
and a deep-fried jalapeño. Served with warm tortillas.  My fiancée had the ENCHILADAS DE MOLE Two corn tortillas rolled and stuffed with chicken or cheese, covered with our homemade
mole sauce, melted cheese and sour cream. Served with rice and refried beans.  My dish won some awards and found the cactus salad to be very good.  It was nice to wrap my own tortillas with steak, beans, and cactus.  I was concerned about the spice but it was perfectly fine.  She like her dish as well and we were full and satisfied."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Was visiting Madison for the Great Midwest Beer Fest and prior to getting in line for the opening we headed west a bit and via Yelp landed in this little Taqueria.  From the front it almost looks too small to dine-in as there are no tables and just a small counter.  But the server will lead you back, literally through the kitchen, to the dinning area in the back of the restaurant.

As we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't spend too much time searching the menu, quickly selecting a torta.

Our server brought some colored chips and two types of salsas; the chips were good but the salsa was nothing great.  The torta on the other hand was excellent, the steak was juicy and had a hint of grilled, smoky flavor.  The sandwich was huge and was more food then needed (had to save room for 5 hours worth of beer sampling)."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"It's a hole in the wall, but in my opinion, great food comes from hole in the walls.  After all, I want the place that can sustain a business just from the food alone and not because it's a nice and pleasant place to sit and chat.  

I'm not sure why people say that it's not the cleanest place to eat.  I didn't see any health department ratings, but the place seemed clean enough.  And after a quick scan of the other reviews on this site, it doesn't seem like anybody's gotten sick or anything either.  I suspect it's just more of the usual Madison liberal snobbery because of the cosmetics of the place.  

It's not the best Mexican food I've had.  I'd like their carne asada to be a little bit more marinated.  I had two carne asada tacos and one al pastor.  They were generous wiht the cilantro which is a definite plus.  I'd love a salsa verde option, but I'll take what I can get.  I didn't particularly enjoy the burrito as it felt a bit soggy.  But despite this, it's the best Mexican in Madison.  It'll certainly satisfy my cravings until I can get back to California or actually make the effort to make my own.  

 There isn't really enough seating for big groups here, but take out is always an option."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Taqueria Guadalajara on Park has some huge positives going for it, which will certainly bring me back, but on the occasion of my first visit there were a few things that were less than stellar. I could see TG regularly hitting a 4 star review and occasionally even a 5 star, but this was my experience today:

Chips and salsa: These were really disappointing. The chips seemed undercooked and were a little leathery. I came in with my son and we were given very few chips. When we asked for more we got another very small basket. The salsas were pretty good (especially the hot), but again the quantities were very limited. I'd happily pay a bit more for enough chips and salsa to enjoy rather than having to ask over and over for very small batches. 

Burrito Mexicana (w/ Carne asada): The burrito was a good size and the guacamole on top was pretty tasty, but that was all of the good. The carne asada had a nice texture, but it was pretty flavorless. A little salt and lime could have gone a LONG way here. There was WAY too much lettuce inside and no enough of everything else. There was also a LOT of tortilla relative to the size of the overall burrito, but fortunately the tortilla was quite good. 

Lomo de puerco in salsa verde: Overall this was my favorite dish of the day. I was hoping for something close to chili verde (which this is NOT), but I enjoyed what I was served nonetheless. The salsa verde has a really good taste, but was a little on the thin side. I also enjoyed the grilled onion served with dish, that added a lot. The pork loin was sliced very thinly and seared pretty hard on the flat top, so it was a little dry. The rice and beans on the side were a nice compliment, and the corn tortillas were excellent! In fact, the corn tortillas may have been the single best thing I had during the entire visit. 

The best thing about TG is the authenticity of the food. There are a number of other dishes I'm excited to try that I think could benefit from this exact authenticity. It's also nice that TG is VERY affordable, but as I mentioned above I'd be okay paying just a bit more for a few things to be a little better. Parking can also be a bit of a chore, but I was lucky and got a spot right out front. The service was very good, and the space is fairly comfortable, albeit slightly on the smaller side. I expect to update this review in the future, but for this particular visit I'd say TG was about a three star stop."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I had the enchiladas de mole with chicken, and they were delicious. My boyfriend had some kind of burrito that he also liked. The service leaves a bit to be desired, but the food is top notch. Will definitely be back."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Take out, delivery or dine in. Yummy 2$ tacos with add on options like avocado cheese and grilled onions. I've had steak and chicken which come with cilantro and onions. I wish they offered fish tacos as well. They make their gorditas in house. Offer two homemade salsas with their chip baskets- a mild and spicy one that is very unique. Offers authenticity at a great value."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I thought we had finally found an awesome neighborhood Mexican place, but nope, the food kind of sucked.  My gorditas tasted kind of old.  The steak was chewy and tasted kind of weird.  The burrito was bland and very soggy.  Aren't they supposed to fry it a little on the grill first?  

I feel bad saying it because the atmosphere was so cool.  It was little and cramped and the furniture was shitty.  There was a tv!  And like kids running around screaming who were somehow attached to the people running the place.  

Oh well, maybe they were having an off night or something"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Given that there are already over 200 reviews for this place, I doubt I will add anything of value. That being said I love this place and would like to support it's fantastic food and service in any fashion possible.

I've said it in other reviews, unfortunately there isn't a depth in diversity of dining in Madison. This is one place that helps solve this issue. Taqueria Guadalajara offers authentic Mexican food in a laid back atmosphere and with warm, friendly service.

As many reviewers have already elaborated, this place is packed at peak times. Luckily service is so fast that waiting doesn't exceed past twenty minutes per party.

When I do go here, I have a tendency to order the same thing over and over again, the steak chimichanga.  I see a lot of people order variety though, including a various assortment of foods with Verde sauce, breakfast, etc... 

All food is made fresh and to order. This is a point of distinction between this taqueria and others in Madison. A clear example is that the steak is made for burritos, tacos, etc. in small batches to satisfy the orders needing steak. At other places, the steak will be made every few hours and will be allowed to sit around. This makes all the difference in taste of freshness and providing restaurant quality. The produce is also prepared in fresh as well every few hours. The tastes are very reflective of going to a classic place in Mexico and asking for a particular food.

The price, friendly staff, and great quality simply has no rival in Madison.

Oh and they also have Mexican cokes, horchata, Jarritos, and a few beers for selection - a nice touch."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Fast and friendly service.  Clean and affordable.  I had the carne asada and pastor Tacos and a side of Orden de cebollitas cambray.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the taco meat had been better seasoned.  The pastor was not bad, but the steak was very bland.  Everyone I was with seemed pleased with their meal and my husband said we could come back for sure (he is kind of picky). He had the steak quesadilla plate."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"In the famous words of Chuck D and Flavor Flave ""don't believe the hype.""

For years our friends of been raving about this place.  We have heard people call this the ""best Mexican restaurant in Madison"" and other people call it the ""absolute best Mexican food period.""   So after a couple years of wanting to try this place...we finally did.

I cannot complain about the aesthetics...it is a cute little place without all the traditional bright colors....but thats where the good ends.

FIRST OFF:   How can you have a Mexican Restaurant that does not serve Margaritas?    Really?   When I want to devour a burritos I want some Tequila and Lime to go with it.   Even if it is the pre-made junk.

SECOND:  The food was bland.....about as bland as bland can be.   My wife ordered a Chicken Quesadilla as she always does at Mexican restaurant and it literally had ZERO taste.    Heck she had to use all of the salsa form the chips to even remotely get a flavor to it.   Oh...and speaking of chips....they are complete straight out of the bag store bought terrible chips.  Even Laredo's has better chips....well...actually they have better food all together and that is saying a lot!

THRID:  Lets talk my burrito.   I decided to go a different route than my normal fajitas or taco salad and got myself a steak burrito.   OMG....this this was.....TERRIBLE!   The steak was as hard as a rock.  The burrito itself was even more bland than my wife's quesadilla and literally had NO TASTE AT ALL.   Worst part is she stole all the salsa and it took the rest of the meal to get more.

So...when heading up Park street and wanting Mexican food this place is a joke.   Traditional....sure but tasteless traditional and just...I would rather eat at Taco Bell."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"If I want to get tacos or a burrito in Madison this is the place I go. The place is small and can have a wait sometimes but if you ask me that's how you know it's good. The burritos are more than enough food to satisfy most anyone and the tacos come in a ton of varieties. And of course why not wash everything down with a Mexican Coca-Cola! 

You might have to walk a block or so after you park but it is more than worth it."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Still haven't dropped the ball. Been going here for years now. Mi Ranchero is my favorite, Chorizo, Steak, Grilled Cactus and whole grilled onions. It brings back memories of Oaxaca, warm nights & Modelo Negro."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Favorites include cheese mole enchiladas and platilo guatelahara  which includes thinly grilled steak, fried jalepeno, onions, beans and nopale salad...mmmm so good."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Upon further review... if it were between Taqueria el Asadero in Chicago and Taqueria Guadalajara in Madison, Asadero would win every time when it came to steak tacos, steak burritos or any other item containing steak. Otherwise, Guadalajara would win on every other dimension."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,Great carne asada burrito. Awesome chips and salsa. Everything very authentic.
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Oh my goodness....I love love love this place!! I've been trying to find good enchiladas and chile relleno since I moved and came to Wisconsin and they have both. The food was hot and fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful. My husband enjoyed the steak tacos. They give you two types of salsa with tortilla chips when you are seated ...one was very hot but both were tasty. Qdoba, Chipotle are fast food compared to this place and I can't even go in those places with a straight face after going to this Taqueria. I will definitely be returning!!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Good Mexican food is hard to come by in Madison.

I had lost all hope when I visited multiple ""Mexican"" restaurants and they put velveeta cheese on everything.  Then I ate at Taqueria Guadalajara and I am so happy that I did!  The food is amazing, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and I am happy to report that they use non-synthetic cheese. Score!

I usually get the Burrito Mexicano or chicken tacos, but anything on the menu is sure to satisfy you and won't break your budget.  

I feel like I need to get a burrito right now after writing this review! Luckily they do take-out.  :)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"By far the best Mexican food I've ever had! Don't let the exterior of the building turn you away...the pink paint makes it look a little sketchy, but the taste of the food put out by this kitchen is off the charts.

To start with, there are 2 kinds of salsa that are really good. Then, I had the Huaraches with steak...so good! My boyfriend ate a chicken chimichanga..best chimichanga either of us has ever tried! The portion sizes are huge, and the prices are really good. Definitely a place I will visit again when I'm in the area!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I hate to write a bad review because these folks are really trying hard. But, my Mi Rancho was not that good. Authentic (I never had cactus before), but the beef, advertised as steak, was very tough. The Mole Enchiladas, a specialty too, wasn't great either. I will go back to give them another chance, but with so many Mexican options they won't get a third try. Sorry."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I come from California, so I've had my fair share of excellent Mexican food, and Taqueria Guadalajara is definitely on par with some of the best Mexican food I've had.

My favorite item here is straightforward: steak tacos. Fresh, soft corn tortillas packed with fresh seasoned steak, onions, cilantro, and lime. It's heaven, plain and simple. Their other meats are of course excellent as well, chicken and chorizo are my other favorites, but seriously, I wouldn't mind only eating their steak tacos for the rest of my life. Would also recommend a horchata to go along with your meal. Many places in California are guilty of diluting their horchatas, but not in Wisconsin! 

Ever since finding out about this place, I now go every week, usually twice when I'm desperate, and always sit at the counter. Always amazing service, and amazing food. Will continue to go here every week while I'm in Madison."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I live six blocks away, but its natty exterior scared me off. The other day, I scoped Mexican restaurants and this came very highly rated. 

As we walked in (with my 11-year-old), it was clean and rustic (another word for an outdated and sparse sh*thole). The clientele combined many Hispanics casually speaking Spanish (big plus) and face-filled Caucasians. Within 10 seconds of seating, we had a bowlful of chips and fresh mild / hot salsa and very pleasant greeting from the server.    

Opening the menu, they filled the pages with Mexican perfection. We're a little adventurous (me more so than my 11-year-old) and was excited by the menu items of tripe, tongue and cactus. OMG, right!?!?! Those items are only found in a Taco Bell entree by freak accident. 

Don't worry, there are many conventional items as well. 

Chowing on chips, we slugged a couple of Jarrito sodas (I had tamarind and he had lime). Before 10 minutes passed, our burritos came. He had beef and I had seasoned pork steak (carne el pastor). While digging in mine, I had to nibble on his too. Both were incredible; the meat was tender and delicious and included sides were refried beans (perfectly seasoned, cooked and homemade) and delicious rice (slightly smoked and cooked to perfection). We were in such delight, I do not know we recalled breathing.

To go, we picked a beef tongue taco (he would not promise to resist French-kissing the taco); Platillo Guadalajara (special with steak, chile and cactus); chimichanga (MASSIVE); tamale dinne and  two Cokes (glass bottle) for UNDER $50! 

Before I typed this up, I sampled the plates and the food is consistent. All the food is homemade, filling and perfectly textured/seasoned. 

I feel like such and idiot for holding out on this joint."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Had driven by this place a few times while visiting back in Madtown, looked pretty real and was on the right side of town so had to try. Yay! Real mexican, made & served by the same, and the place full of local hispanic families. Yes, it was hot & humid (Madison in August, right?) and my togo sat for 5mins before I got my ticket. The world didn't end with a 5min wait and the food was FANTASTIC! Lingua tacos, melt in your mouth good. Carne asada burrito, best since San Diego street food.  Realize your a gabacho, gringo, and get some darn fine mexi here!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Can't believe I haven't written a review yet.

This place has the best Mexican food I've found so far in Madison (I've had better elsewhere, but it really is quite good for serving white bread Wisconsinites) and they are quite affordable!

SO sticks with the Lomo de Puerco en Salsa Verde every time, tender with a nice heat. I jump around and have tried a variety of taco, burrito, quesadilla, and platillo combinations. I recommend pork for your choice of meat, flavorful but not tough or stringy. Definitely try a horchata, Mexican Coke, or Jarritos with your meal. Tamarind Jarritos is my favorite.

The place is small, with a pick up spot and small counter in front, with maybe 10 tables in the back. I recommend an early lunch/dinner especially if you want a meal on the weekends (!!) so you don't have to wait in the cramped space up front (the line extends outside even during winter..). Thankfully food comes out pretty fast and you get free salsa and chips to curb your hunger pangs."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"You will not find better mexican food in Madison, that's a sure thing, possibly all of Wisconsin, maybe something decent in Milwaukee. This is the closest thing to the kick-ass mexican offered in Los Angeles. If you expect to be seated in a middle of the road white surburban scared of foreigners sort of way, you're way out of your league. Go back to Applebee's. This is a family owned and run authentic mexican joint. They know what they are doing and they do it well. I have found the tamales to be pretty awesome, the burrito is okay, the fresh salsa is amazing and spicy, I love the roasted jalapenos, of course I do that at home myself now, my wife likes the tortas. I've had the Guadalajara plate, which was pretty good. Try some things that you would not normally try, and have some new experiences. It might not be super duper fantastic to you, but then you know what you like and what you don't.

If you go to LA ever, try La Fogata's on Van Nuys in Sherman Oaks. That is truly kick-ass, the fresh salsa, the burritos, the tamales, etc. That would get 5 stars for sure, and compared to La Fogata's in LA, this place in Madison would probably be 3.5 stars. But I gave it 5 based on Madison, and what little quality food there is in Wisconsin in general, unless all you eat are brats and cheese, then you are in the right place! Go Badgers?"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Ordered a grilled steak burrito for delivery and when I got it there was no steak.  The delivery service (Eats24) contacted the restaurant and said for sure there was steak in the burrito... so I guess the customer who's eating it is wrong!  What a joke, food was at best average otherwise.  Won't recommend this place to anyone."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I was browsing through my Bucky Book when I found a coupon that said ""two free tacos."" I thought well I do like Mexican food s, so why not? I went down about 11:30 and sat right at the counter in front. They instantly hand me a menu and ask me what I'd like to drink. I tell them Coca Cola, they bring me a glass bottle. I order my two tacos, one steak, and one chicken. 

After I order a guy walks in and sits two seats down, he looks familiar.... I see his name tag on his shirt. It's Chris Rickert the columnist from Wisconsin State Journal. Mr. Rickert was there to interview the owners about the redevelopment of the Park Street area near Fish Hatchery Road. Turns out the owners of the restaurant just bought the building yesterday... She said she is not going anywhere and her family loves Madison. I earned myself as little spot in the article as Chris and I started talking about his columns and the food. 

Chris and I came to a determination, Taqueria Guadalajara is the best Mexican food in town. Service was great and food tasted very fresh. I will be back for sure, also prices are awesome $1.75 for a taco!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"This place is everything that has been described. Small, authentic, shabby looking, iffy service.

It was a little hard to find parking, but I guess that is not an uncommon problem in Madison. They advertise they serve mixed drinks but they don't. They don't even have margaritas. 

I got the Mexican Burrito and a veggie taco. The burrito was kinda bland, possibly would have tasted better with meat in it but I was less than impressed. The veggie taco was much tastier and wished I had gone that route instead.

It was also kinda hot in there but I guess air conditioning isn't common in Madison since it stays cold most of the year. I may consider going back there again but I wasn't completely sold."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Qualifications:  Resident of San Diego for 4 years, frequenter of Taco Shops.

Quick synopsis:  Highly Recommended, great food great prices.  Will go back soon.

We had a group of 4 total, one of which is an 11 month old baby, for lunch around 1:30 on a Saturday.  We sat at a table pretty quickly however the 2 baby seats were taken.  By the time were were leaving every available seat was taken.  To start they brought out some chips and salsa.  The chips were regular but the salsa's were home made and fantastic.  There was a red and a picante.  I bought a cup of the picante for $4 to take home, it was pretty much the perfect spiciness.  

Between us all we order Chile Relleno, Taco Dinner, Veggie Sopa, Chicken Enchilada, and a Chicken Taco.  My order was the Relleno and for $7 I couldn't expect anything more.  Rice, re-fried beans, lettuce, tomato, the chile, and 5 corn tortillas.  I was really stoked on the tortillas because usually a place only gives you like 2.  Everything on the dish was very good.  I was actually really surprised on how tasty the chile was.  It came with a ""traditional red sauce"" on it that complimented it really nicely.  I am a pretty big eater and was satisfied after I was done.  

My baby had the chicken taco for $2.  She can't talk but we are pretty sure she loved it.  We were really happy that there was something so simple on the menu we could offer her.  I finished off what she didn't eat and I thought the shredded chicken had a great flavor and was tender.  My wife got the taco dinner that came with beans and rice.  It came with 2 tacos carne and pork.  She said she really liked the carne but the pork was pretty standard.  She wanted to specifically note that the tortillas were fantastic, I agree.

Mother in law got the Sopa ($3) and Enchilada ($7).  I had a bite of each.  I haven't eaten too much sopa but it was absulutely delishes, I like to call it an open faced tamale.  Her burrito was covered in a green sauce that had quite a nice flavor, you could really taste the pepper in it.  MIL said they were really good and the value for the price was excellent.

I wish I could give out fractions of stars because I don't really like giving out 5 unless it totally blows me away.  I would give them at least 4.5 though.  It exceeded our expectations, which started high, and the prices were very good.  The dining area isn't very large so if you have a big group I would probably stay away.  But for a family I think it was perfect.  Nice moderate ambient noise to keep baby happy and great food for dad."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Love the beer choices. Too bad there aren't margaritas. Staff are great, attentive enough to have your needs met. Quick enough for work lunch! Chips and salsa replenished a few times.

The place is small and cozy, windows along the back wall. I like the bright walls and flatware.

The food was excellent - rice, beans, burrito, tacos, steak, fried jalapeno, chips, two types of salsa, Modelos. I'll be back for sure; there are many more items on the menu I hope to try."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Two weeks after visiting San Diego I'd been craving real Mexican food worse than I'd ever craved Chipotle previously. Came here with my buddy from SoCal to try to dwell the pain.

Carne asada burrito and horchata were quite good. Had I not been enlightened by the bliss that is San Diegon Mexican food, I'd probably give this 5 stars. 

Neat atmosphere, you can see the whole kitchen from the ""bar"" area and it's in what appears to be an old house. I'll probably be back soon."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"As many have noted, their roast pork is absolutely delicious. Be sure to order at least 1 of your sope, gordita, or taco order with the pork. So flavorful and moist.

The gorditas were better than the tacos, in my opinion. Corn tortillas were a little chewy for us, but the gorditas had a nice crispy exterior with the cheese and refried beans which add to the flavour.

Also had a burrito, which is really good as well. Not quite as much meat as I would have preferred, but the variety of ingredients within does provide a good flavor profile.

Overall it's relatively inexpensive, very flavorful, and efficient service."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"A bunch of my friends and I had been meaning to try out this place because it is so close to where I live, usually looks busy, and we are curious people. We finally got around to it last night, and it was the best homemade Mexican food I have had yet in Madison!

The front part has a dining counter with a grill, which looked inviting, but we sat in the back part of the restaurant with tables. The two salsas they serve before the meal are great - although the green salsa was a bit more spicy than I prefer, it was still delicious, and I'm sure people with a higher tolerance for heat would absolutely love it.
  
I had a burrito mexicano (which comes with mild red salsa, sour cream and guacamole spread on the top to look like a Mexican flag) with steak. It tasted far better than any burrito I'd had in recent memory. I was surprised at how few beans were in it, but it may have been because the two people I was with ordered theirs with no beans and they came back a couple of times to make sure they had our order correct. I was happy with the staff there for that very reason and also because they were just pleasant to begin with.

For what you get, there's no beating the price, either :) I will definitely be back for more!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Today I ordered a take-out vegetarian burrito from the Taqueria Guadelajara in order to check out the generally laudatory appraisals of previous patrons.  Unhappily, I could not concur with the consensus.

While the burrito was tasty, it couldn't be customized.  That is to say, there was ONE burrito on offer, whose ingredients were mandatory.  This contrasts with other taquerias of my experience which offer dozens of options.

In addition, it was expensive (comparatively).  While the menu listed burritos at $6 each, I was charged $8 (because it was VEGETARIAN?)  Since the most expensive ingredient in a burrito is the MEAT, why does Taqueria Guadelajara charge a 34% premium for a burrito that EXCLUDES it?

In short, the Taqueria Guadelajara burrito was OK, but neither so toothsome nor such a good value as to merit a return.

(Full disclosure:  I'm not a native, so perhaps this is the best that can be had this far north.  I will continue to search.)"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I would give this place a 5 star except that I'm still a tough love reviewer and I only reserve 5 stars for impeccable ambiance and food to match.  The food was delicious and the wait staff was very attentive.

I had the torta de carne asada, and my dining buddy ordered the torta mexicana.  I know a thing or two about tortas because my family used to run a taco truck in the 1990s with only Mexican customers. I expected the torta de carne asada to be similar to what my friend ordered, the torta mexicana-- a flat strip of tender meat, cilantro, and tomato, mayonnaise, salsa, etc.  I would order what she ordered since my torta carne asada came undone too easily.  I don't want to be a messy eater if I'm about to go to another meeting afterwards. 

Enough with categories-- the tacos looked delicious, and free chips and salsa. the spicy salsa was pretty spicy, stick to the red mild sauce for the faint of heart.  This isn't child's play. 

I also ordered the horchata rice milk cinnamon beverage. Good stuff. 

To one side of me was a group of gringolandia college badgers, and to my right were Mexican customers who only spoke Spanish with the owners, in a very friendly demeanor as though they are regulars. The seating availability during lunch was spacious, but it might be during when school was not in session. 

Try this place before you decide to drop money at a chain Mexican burrito place."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"FINALLY! I found good carry-out mexican food in Madison. I usually go to La Hacienda out of old college day habits of seeking cheap cheap cheap mexican food. Lately, I've been seeking something better like I got used to while living in San Diego...Guadalajara was pretty close. I went to Francisco's first, but they were closed on Sundays (they did have a sign in the window ""$10 margarita pitchers"" so I have a feeling my straw and I will eventually try it out).

I got a burrito which was outstanding and only $6. My only complaints were that the cheese was melted on the exterior (making it hard to eat w/o a fork and knife), it was zapped in the microwave (unnecessary if the cheese was placed inside), and the lady was trying to be skimpy on the salsa (I wanted to try it all). 

Everyone was speaking Spanish, it was extremely quick, the staff was very friendly, all the other food going out looked great, the place seemed clean despite its quirky late night drunken Cabo taco shop appearance and the salsa was really good in my opinion. 

I can't wait to go back!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"It was taco Tuesday and I decided to eat here for the first time.  Before I review the restaurant I would like to talk about tacos....and food in general.  
I LOVE tacos.  
I could eat them more than once a day...and I have (don't judge)!  In my mind there are two types of tacos.  Regular tacos and craft tacos...or fusion...new age...call them whatever you like.  Designer tacos...ok...ok....anywayz....I'm not going to walk into a restaurant like Taqueria Guadalajara and expect tacos like El Dorado Grill just like I'm not going to walk into Glass Nickel and expect pizza like Pizza Brutta.  It's important to know the restaurant BEFORE you go.  I hate all the reviews that say ""meh...it was okay...but nothing outstanding"".  What??

To the restaurant~  I had 4....count 'em....4 tacos.....2 carne asada (steak) and 2 pastor (marinated pork).  They were delicious.  My partner had a chicken quesadilla with beans and rice.  Her's was delicious and she ate all her beans and rice!!  It was what we expected.  I like this place....the food is good....inexpensive....the service was great....they sell beer although we both had diet pepsi...and we had fun."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I can see why this place is loved. They make their food with love. It's authentic alright. I still prefer Casa del Sol and Laredo's any day tho. The salsa is tasty but full of chunks and the really hot salsa is just that, reallllllllllly hot. Too hot to enjoy. But the chimichanga and the steak quesadilla were delicious. Juicy, shredded chicken, buttery quesadilla, great guacamole for only $2! Just watch out for bones in the chicken. I crunched into a large one. Almost made me lose my appetite. Food was too good to stop eating tho. I decided not to mention the bone because I just wanted to have a good time without any drama. I'm not afraid to mention it here tho, just as a warning to you all. Chew carefully and enjoy!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"Mexican patrons lining up outside a Mexican place is always a good sign. The place is a hidden gem in Wisconsin. It doesn't show up on most internet top ten lists, but most residents know about the place. 

I had a pork chimichanga for $7. When they say stuffed with meat, it was stuffed!! They did not shortchange me. The same item in a fancier setting would be at least $20. It was a little greasy, but hey, it is a deep fried burrito. 

The spicy salsa is good. But do ask for gauc. It was very well done. I also tried a Jarritos which is supposed to be a Mexican soda. I went with lime though most people recommend the tamarind. My partner had the chicken enchiladas which was flavorful."
Taqueria Guadalajara,grilled steak burrito,"I'm new to Madison and have been CRAVING tacos for the past month.  I stopped in for the first time last night on the recommendation of a good friend, and am I glad he told me about this place.

Firstly, the atmosphere is GREAT.  I love the the small, cramped, homey feeling of the restaurant.  The fact that it's a converted house gives it extra character.  You walk in and there's barely enough room for a table, let alone customers. 

I had steak, chicken and pork tacos with rice and beans.  Topped with fresh cilantro and onions and paired with a Dos Equis, it's just what I needed to finish off a lazy Sunday.  

Did I mention it's CHEAP!  I'll definitely be satisfying my taco cravings here again soon."
Madistan,beef kabob roll,"Reasons why I love Madistan:

The restaurant is super clean.

It's a family run business.  The owner is there daily and takes pride in serving his patrons delicious, authentic food.  He was very friendly and personable.  The owner's wife is the main cook - she makes everything fresh from scratch.

The food is delicious.  We had the chicken biryani, a gyro and beef samosas.  The samosas were to die for.  The beef was seasoned perfectly and wrapped in a thin, crispy wrapper, then fried until golden.  I would order a whole basket of those things.  Just amazingly good!

The prices were very reasonable.

Definitely one of our new favorite places in Madison to grab a quite bite.  Thanks Amin and Naheed.  You are wonderful!"
Madistan,beef kabob roll,"Great place. I have tried the shawarma, gyros, tikka roll and beef samosay, all good! The staff if friendly too."
Madistan,beef kabob roll,"I am going there again for sure. I had the biriyani, beef kabab roll and the Golap jamun. 
The biriyani was good, portion size is slightly small. But taste wise very good! I think there is still some room for improvement. 
Still I am giving the 5 start specially because of the Golap jamun and the beef  roll. These two are mouth watering. Beef is moist and juicy, very well seasoned and delicious. 
For the gulap jamun I believe this is the best Golap jamun I have tested so far in Madison   

Altogether price wise taste wise I would love to go there again."
Madistan,beef kabob roll,"Five stars because:
1. DELICIOUS food
2. Super reasonably priced
3. The nicest staff

1. My beef kebab roll was outstanding. The beef was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The lamb shawarma and fries also taste great.

2. I don't know where else you can get a meal in Madison for 5.99. One of the best values in town.

3. The friendly folks behind the counter are really why I am rooting for this spot. They were polite, smiled and were really helpful.

It's not fast food, so don't go if you need to be in and out in 5 minutes (or call ahead). I really hope they start offering delivery and late night food!"
Madistan,beef kabob roll,"Went to Madistan early morning last night... as expected the restaurant was filled with fellow bar goers hungry and slightly rambunctious. Some people were upset by the 5-7 minute wait time. For me the slight wait was not an issue, I wasn't expecting the food to be ""fast food"" and could see my order being freshly prepared behind the counter. A bus boy delivering orders could solve the ""wait"" issue. Although it wasn't a big deal for me. I ordered a Gyro with fries and a Beef Kabob. Both were absolutely delicious.

The Gyro came in a fluffy pita, which made me pleasantly surprised, as middle eastern pita tends to be more tortilla-like and less greek fluffy. The tzatziki was on point, and complimented the flavors of the meat perfectly.  

The Beef Kabob had a slight spice at first tastes, but was not overwhelming or with an unpleasant aftertaste burn. 

I would skip the fries for next time. They were below average, which is my only complaint. They were over fried and burning in temp. 

Foodies in Madison, please go to Madistan. It is the type of local, family owned restaurant that has fantastic food and prices. Perfect for a college town :) 

I will be back!"
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Loved the chicken Biryani with a mango fruit juice on the side.  The seasoned rice was memorable, the chicken was tender, and the sauce was delicious and a great contrast to the slightly spicy dish.

The chef was friendly and Amin is one hip and modern restaurant owner.  Sounds like he's got some new things in the works, like a coupon in the cap times and a tandoori oven to make nan bread."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Loved the chicken shawarma and the gyros!  Just delicious! My Sister was able to order mixed dal and this was easy vegan and gluten free.  Was not that impressed with the samosas and falafel,  but the rest was amazing!"
Madistan,chicken biryani,"You will really get mad after eating at this place. When we entered here, we observed that menu options were minimal but then we thought it would be home made like food. We ordered chicken korma + mango lassi =$11. We were hoping food to be good. We get food in a carry box..we open it darn a scoop of rice.. Little bit of salad and chicken korma full of oil. 1 frozen chapathi. Korma tasted stale at least 2-3 days old. I asked for additional paid rice, owner gave one more scoop in a small bowl but did not charge. Looks like they had limited rice and he wanted for his other korma orders.


Big disappointment. 

People - please avoid."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"My wife & I had the chicken tikka, shawerma, somosas & chicken biryani. Wonderfull food for a very reasonable price. My wife says it tastes home made. I agree. Please open in Milwaukee!!"

Madistan,chicken biryani,"Madistan is simply, great!  They have really good food, and the people there are so nice.  I came in one morning right when they opened and the lady was super nice in helping explain what everything was, and giving recommendations.  I ordered a Chicken Biryani and Chicken Qorma.  Both super flavorful.  The rice that came with the biryani was delicious.  The chicken was well cooked, and nice and tender for both dishes.  The chicken Qorma was a bit oily for my tastes, but still quite delicious.  Their samosas are also OUT OF THIS WORLD!"
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Was in the mood for some fried chicken so I stopped into Madistan on my way home. Fried chicken was so undercooked it was actually bloody. Their gyros are good, but don't compete with The Parthenon a block away. But they have really good shawarma and falafel for very reasonable prices. Overall a pretty good restaurant with reasonable prices for decently large portion sizes."
Madistan,chicken biryani,Super sweet girls helping their parents (?) run the family restaurant. Yummy biryani. ..portions are a bit small.
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Came to Madison for work and randomly found this gem, the biryani is fantastic for the price, very well seasoned. The chicken is little dry, but where else can you get biryani for so cheap? AND they have beef samosas which I hardly see at south asian restaurants, the chutney they come with is pretty splendid."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"We drove from Chicago and needed a halal place to eat. The food was delicious!! BEST cheeseburger!!! Awesome chicken tikka role, chicken biryani, fries, shawarma, falafel! We basically ordered everything off the menu. Super cute restaurant."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"I see a lot of good reviews here. I agree with two points. Good staff and good price. Unfortunately for me it ends there. The food needs a lot of improvement in terms of both, quality and taste. The chicken tikka roll had shredded chicken. When I asked why that was, the answer was that was quicker to cook. Not the answer I was expecting. Also, the falafel seemed to be cooked in stale oil.  If they get away from daily specials and focus on perfecting the core menu, it might get better. Good luck!"
Madistan,chicken biryani,Best and authentic Pakistani samosas in town. Their food is very close to real Pakistani home cooking. I tried Chicken Qorma and it was great. The owner is not Mediterranean so don't expect great shawarma or falafel. Love this place and definitely will go back.
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Finally got to Madistan for some great food! It's kind of a strange mix of homey ethnic food and fried things (think spring rolls, samosas, fried chicken), but it was all good enough to work! The chicken tikka roll had excellent quality shredded meat with a yogurt sauce and two decent dipping sauces-one spicy and one sweet. My friend loved his chicken biryani special; he said the rice rivaled Palmyra's! The samosas and spring rolls were both good, not great, but improved with the sauces. The man who took our orders (I think the manager?!) came over to check on us after the rush died down, which was super nice! Be warned that this place is small and fills up quickly. Definitely go for the low prices, flavorfully spiced food, and lovely service."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Madistan seems primarily oriented as a takeout place serving Pakistani and Mediterranean food. A few daily specials (3 on my visit) and a limited regular menu--e.g., Pakistani rolls, gyros, falafel and fried chicken--round out the selection.  Food is served in styrofoam boxes with plastic utensils.  Limited indoor seating is on backless stools at a counter or high table.  Counter service is friendly.

The dal special served with naan was very tasty and satisfied as a quick, relatively healthy lunch.  The spicy sauce with the chicken achar was flavorful but the three small chicken pieces were very pink near the bone and did not appear to be cooked enough.  This definitely put me off on the dish.  

Overall, Madistan seems to fill a niche for ethnic food aimed at students but is not a place one would go to have a sit down lunch and chat."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Not bad.  The Shwarma was good,  the chicken Tikka less so, and the gryo was fairly generic (but good) but the fries were tasty, and the falafel wasn't overly greasy.  The chutneys were also good.  Now the daal was really nice, as was the fresh made flat bread.  The fried chicken was microwaved to reheat and I'd pass on it.... also expect to pay for water as cups of water are warm tap.  

Having said that the pricing was very reasonable (even though it didn't match the menu or the sign in the restaurant for all item).  The service was very friendly.  And while there is no parking, ita an overall good pick if your nearby, on foot, and hankering for some decent Pakistani and Indian fare."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Their Chicken Biriyani is hands down the best Indian/Pakistani dish I have had in Madison. That taste at about $6-7 is incredible. The Shawarma was good too.
It's a modest place with a limited menu, but the food is amazing."
Madistan,chicken biryani,"GR8 food and reasonably tried. We got the chicken biryani, burger, chicken tikka roll and fried chicken. I would pass on the fried chicken since it had no taste, but everything else was good.

Would like to try their shawarma and falafel next time!"
Madistan,chicken biryani,"Cheap isn't always the same as value.  Yes, Madistan is cheap but I was less then impressed with the quality of the entrees.  The falafel sandwich fell flat as the falafel balls were tough and the pita chewy.  The chicken biryani was well spiced but it was a tad greasy and the chicken rather dry.  Service was great and friendly.  Be warned that this is not ""fast"" food.  I have no qualms about waiting as long as it is worth it.  On my visit, it wasn't.  Maybe an off night so if I am in the area, I'll give it a second try."

Pita Pit,chicken caesar,"The staff here sucks. I've been in to this place twice and the first time I went to use a Hooked deal and the guy behind the counter literally laughed out loud at me and said that only college students use that app and their deals. Pretty rude behavior as there was a line of people to order. Everyone was looking at me for wanting to use a deal to try their food out. My plan was to try them out and use them often if the food was good.

The second time I was in, we ordered our meals and then grabbed a seat by the window. The guy behind the counter yells at us in complete disgust (in front of 15 people) to get back in line. The other people in line were so shocked at his behavior that they even said he was so rude. The thought of getting scolded by a restaurant employee is so shocking to me that I will not be back. And, I've now shared my horrible experiences with others in hopes that they don't have the same thing happen.

oh, the food? it's nothing to rave about. pretty so-so in Madison terms. There are a bunch of other places nearby to eat that are way better. The veggies were a bit (brown/past their prime) both times I went, and the chicken (1 time) was gristly and inedible."
Pita Pit,chicken caesar,"I cock-blocked with a pita . . . . =(

I discovered this place during my trip out here for work.  I went in to order a pita and as the girl at the counter was making it, a guy walks in and she gets really excited.  They chat about their plans for the night because apparently he was going laser tagging, but she has to work until 10:30pm.  She abruptly has to kill the conversation to finish my order.  Pitas should never stand in the way of love.

Like subway, but 100x better!
White or wheat pita
Meat:  spicy chicken, beef, falafel, badger special!!!! (potatoes, bacon, cheese, jalapeños, oinions, green peppers,nspicy sauce) and a bunch of other choices.
Add ons: everything and anything:  spinach, romaine, alfalfa, tomato, hummus, olives, taziki, pickles, onions, pepperoncinis, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, etc.
9 diff sauces: mayo, sour cream, spicy chipotle, ranch, etc.

I hope I can find one in California . . . and not cock-block."
Pita Pit,chicken caesar,"Love Pita Pits! Used to have one back home but they sadly closed down and hadn't eaten here in years ! Coming back the menu was basically the same, no complaints from me! I always either get the gyros or chicken Caesar , both are amazing. Love it."
Pita Pit,gyros,"Love Pita Pits! Used to have one back home but they sadly closed down and hadn't eaten here in years ! Coming back the menu was basically the same, no complaints from me! I always either get the gyros or chicken Caesar , both are amazing. Love it."
Pita Pit,gyros,"Have only been here once, after the Mifflin Street Block party, so yes, I was pretty intoxicated.  And I remember my pita being amazing.  

It's nice having a fast-food, pita place.  I usually prefer local eateries over chains but this is an exception.  Reminds me of  a Subway for Gyros."
Pita Pit,hummus,"I love Mediterranean food and would never have thought I would ever prefer a chain to many locally owned spots, but Pita Pit ROCKS!!

I always get the gyro and it's always wonderful. I love how much you can add (hummus, avocado, etc) without paying an additional fee. This sandwich is so freaking perfect I could eat it for 3 meals a day. The meat is cooked right. The veggies are plentiful. Most importantly, the name doesn't lie, the PITA is fluffy and yummy and perfect even while toasted.

Ordering delivery? PP is one of the fastest places in town. Hungry after a night out on state street? It's open late. The staff is so friendly and make it look like they actually enjoy working there.

I even got a $5 pita from using the Hooked app!"
Pita Pit,hummus,Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Basically it's like a subway but for pittas. The staff was very friendly and my hummus in wheat with toppings was really good. My boyfriend and daughter seemed to really like theirs as well. Only complaint is the price. I think it's a little over priced but I'd probably still come here again.
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"Been going here since I was a kid.  Pizza has always sucked.  Cheap and greasy with an abundance of uncooked dough to make up for the meager toppings.  Best thing going for it is the cup of sauce to dip your nearly sauce-less slice in.  Still I go every few months when I get a hankering, and then I am disappointed and sick afterwards."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"I have a love/love/hate relationship with Rocky's. It's become part of my Madison routine to occasionally drive into their tiny mini-mall and grab a motherlode slice and then a donut from Greenbush. It's one of those ""only in Madison"" things everyone should try once.

Their pizza is soft, doughy, sugary, strange, spicy, greasy, puffy, icky, and delicious. It's the kind of food you eat after a long hard day when you just don't give a *$%# anymore. And you enjoy it - a lot. Especially if you order a side of nacho cheese sauce to dip your liquid-smoke-flavored-cheese-crust into. 

There's really nothing like Rocky Rococo's anywhere. It's one of those weird things in Wisconsin that become addictive. I even take visitors and tourists here. And they always leave confused and happy. 

Great for people watching too. Pay attention for locals trying to eat healthy with a tiny salad covered in five pints of creamy salad dressing while longly looking at their friends' pizza, which probably has lower calories per serving."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"OK, a key to getting decent pizza here (assuming you walk-in) is to go while they are busy. If you go during off peak times your pizza will not be fresh since it's under heat lamps.
I will fully admit that part of the appeal to me is that I used to love this stuff when I was a kid.  If you want to go here to eat in, check the coupon mailings sent to Madison households as they usually have Rocky's coupons.  The regent locations has deals for slices and breadsticks after 8PM. The ""Party Pizzaria"" locations are nicer, with better decor, newspapers, games, etc.  And of course, if you order a full pizza rather than a slice, your pizza will be fresher than being under a heatlamp."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"It was my first time experiencing pizza in Rocky Rococo's and the food was delicious. I liked the service because the employees are friendly. The extra cheesy super sausage is delicious and the price was affordable. I tried the Original Chicago and Meatworks and I loved the extra cheesy the most! 
Thanks Rocky Rococo for such a hearty pizza meal!"
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"While visiting Madison for a work trip we were busy working away and nearly missed lunch, however our vendor decided to call in pizza and making it a working lunch. The pizza arrived fast and fresh, the pizza was good however it almost reminded me of a deep dish from Little Caesars. It was your typical pan style pizza, cut into squares. Nothing stood out about this pizza so I have to admit that I would probably skip right over Rocky Rococo on my next trip to town."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"I was here twice on a National Tour with a musical, and I can say, hands down, that Rocky's is the best pizza I had while crossing through 43 states!  Amazing taste at an amazing price!"
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"I have been to Rocky Rococo at their State Street location on at least 25 occasions, generally ordering a deep dish style slice of sausage pizza.  I like the sweet flavor, and one does not have to be a culinary Sherlock Holmes to realize that part of the secret for the yummy quality is just adding more sugar to the dough.  The combination of pork and sugar is common, as it is found in canned pork and beans, breakfast sausages with maple syrup, and various recipes for ham.  The cardboard box is a slight twist on the usual way of serving individual slice pizza, and the use of the box makes it seem that your single slice is not just a ""left over,"" but a meal prepared just for you.   The ultimate in deep dish pizza is not Rocky Rococo's, but, e.g., Zachary's in Berkeley, California."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"You can count on a doughy, terrible, undercooked, greasy pizza unless you get the whole wheat crust. They make pizza on a  chain conveyor belt like Burger King does. You can't get  a good crust without an oven. They could care less as employee s can't burn pizza and this saves money and time. But if you get the whole wheat crust it turns out great! They have a good sauce and awesome sausages. Order a wholewheat Uncle Sal's and you will thank me. Plus you can feed 6 big people easily!"
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,I ordered this pizza while visiting Madison for work. This is the best pizza I have ever had! And the delivery was very fast too.
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"Deep dish, thick crust, cheesy, saucy, sloppy pizza.  You're damn right.  Beats the hell out of Ian's flat, sauceless, steamroller pizza.  If I want mac and cheese, I'll buy a box of it for 99 cents at the grocery store.  Rocky's is the only pizza I've ever had that has good sausage - it's real chunks of sausage, not the little rabbit turd sausage balls.

Tip: go here for slices before the Badgers football games - they have a ton of them ready, and they're a helluva lot better than the gross 73% ""lean"" frozen burgers and undercooked brats that are served at the tailgates and in the stadium.  Lines aren't long and you get your food quickly."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"Let me be the first to say that this place has unappetizing food. 

The pizza slices I've had from here (tried on 3 separate occasions before I decided to write this review) were terrible. The crust was soft soggy because of the grease, the pepperoni and sausage slices were unsavory, and the breadsticks I had were under seasoned.

Overall, it's cheap and fast and that's a big draw for most people, but why would I eat here when I would rather go to the McDonald's on Mills and Regent or any other place that doesn't have grease as a main ingredient for their pizza slices. I'll pass."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"Alright, listen. I love Rocky Rococo. I grew up in the area and grew up eating this pizza from a young age. It's great, you know what you are getting. Its comfortable. This all being said, if you take a step back, the quality is really pretty questionable. And the advertising is so bizarre (in a good way!), my fiance from Ohio will take pictures and send them to friends out of state for them to marvel over. Rocky's is a weird place. It is what it is, and in my opinion, what it is is delicious. We never order this pizza for dinner, but I'll come for lunch every so often. Haters gonna hate. I think if you grew up eating here, you probably love it. If not, it's a mixed bag. 

Also fwiw I had cravings for this pizza when I lived in Colorado. I think that says more about me than Rocky Rococo."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"Yikes, extremely soggy pizza and my order was missing an item. Tasted like grade school microwaved pizza."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,I used to live right next to the regent st. location.  It was a good place to get some good pizza.  They always had some coupon or deal in the onion so I'd go here once or twice a month.
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"It's amazing that since the 90's, Rocky's has not changed their business model or overhauled their menu.  The same choices of pizza by the slice.  In a pinch (which is why we were there) Rocky's is fine but by no means is it a place that I would purposely plan to go.  Generic sauce.  Crust on the verge of being undercooked.  Interior worn and dated."
Rocky Rococo,sausage and pepperoni pizza slice,"Great pizza, horrible service.  Our group had 3 families.  2 of our families got food within a short time, the third family waited over 45 minutes for their food.  No explanation or apology from management, just excuse after excuse."
Rocky Rococo,original chicago pizza with italian sausage,"Been going here since I was a kid.  Pizza has always sucked.  Cheap and greasy with an abundance of uncooked dough to make up for the meager toppings.  Best thing going for it is the cup of sauce to dip your nearly sauce-less slice in.  Still I go every few months when I get a hankering, and then I am disappointed and sick afterwards."
Rocky Rococo,original chicago pizza with italian sausage,"I have a love/love/hate relationship with Rocky's. It's become part of my Madison routine to occasionally drive into their tiny mini-mall and grab a motherlode slice and then a donut from Greenbush. It's one of those ""only in Madison"" things everyone should try once.

Their pizza is soft, doughy, sugary, strange, spicy, greasy, puffy, icky, and delicious. It's the kind of food you eat after a long hard day when you just don't give a *$%# anymore. And you enjoy it - a lot. Especially if you order a side of nacho cheese sauce to dip your liquid-smoke-flavored-cheese-crust into. 

There's really nothing like Rocky Rococo's anywhere. It's one of those weird things in Wisconsin that become addictive. I even take visitors and tourists here. And they always leave confused and happy. 

Great for people watching too. Pay attention for locals trying to eat healthy with a tiny salad covered in five pints of creamy salad dressing while longly looking at their friends' pizza, which probably has lower calories per serving."
Rocky Rococo,original chicago pizza with italian sausage,"OK, a key to getting decent pizza here (assuming you walk-in) is to go while they are busy. If you go during off peak times your pizza will not be fresh since it's under heat lamps.
I will fully admit that part of the appeal to me is that I used to love this stuff when I was a kid.  If you want to go here to eat in, check the coupon mailings sent to Madison households as they usually have Rocky's coupons.  The regent locations has deals for slices and breadsticks after 8PM. The ""Party Pizzaria"" locations are nicer, with better decor, newspapers, games, etc.  And of course, if you order a full pizza rather than a slice, your pizza will be fresher than being under a heatlamp."
Rocky Rococo,original chicago pizza with italian sausage,"It was my first time experiencing pizza in Rocky Rococo's and the food was delicious. I liked the service because the employees are friendly. The extra cheesy super sausage is delicious and the price was affordable. I tried the Original Chicago and Meatworks and I loved the extra cheesy the most!

Rocky Rococo,original rococo chicago with italian sausage,"Just saw some ridiculous driving from one of the delivery cars. It was a SILVER FORD TAURUS with Rocky Rococo top driving during rush hour(5pm September 21st 2012) on University ave(campus area), cutting all the vehicles off, driving on the bike lane and changing lanes like crazy(from right to left).

The Nile,hummus,"I love this place. Excellent vegetarian and vegan options. I'm partial to the spinach pie (which is surprisingly vegan) and vegetarian platter with hummus, falafel and grape leaves (which are the best in Madison in my opinion).

The only negative to this'd place is that the service can be very slow at times. I've come at off hours when we're the only ones there and it takes too long to even get our waters."
The Nile,hummus,"After reading the reviews I really wanted to try this place. We went for lunch on a Saturday. Imagine my surprise that there is no lunch menu and lunch was going to set me back a minimum of $15! I ordered an appetizer of falafel, which was the best thing I had, but an additional $5.95. The entree was chicken schwirma, with a side of hummus. I thought the main portion was small and came without rice? That was weird to me, never had it that way before. I even inquired and was just told ""no, it does not come with rice"". No offer to bring me rice. There was one man waiting on the entire place. He seemed a little distracted and maybe irritated, but was cordial to us. I doubt I will go back, I have had better Mediteranean food elsewhere and for less money."
The Nile,hummus,"Very good, period. Visiting from NM and having grown up in Detroit, it's fair for me say I certainly know good middle-eastern food from bad. The pea soup was excellent. The hummus was also very good. I had the center cut lamb chops and a skewer of shrimp, also excellent. My only very small observation was the pita bread. I prefer the smaller freshly naked square pockets verses the heavier style they serve. Not a deal breaker - just what I'm use to from Detroit. I'd go back here in a heartbeat and I sincerely recommend the Nile as well."
The Nile,hummus,"We stopped in for a late lunch and had an excellent experience.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you; this place doesn't disappoint.  The middle eastern coffee was great and we shared a few small plates for our meal.  The beef shawarma is absolutely the best I've ever had!  The falafel, hummus, and lentil soup were flavorful and fresh.  We've been dreaming of the flavors we had since we stopped in.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!"
The Nile,hummus,"I am not optimistic about this location, since I was a fan of the previous occupant as well (an Indian restaurant), which obviously didn't survive. The interior is unremarkable, but I can't say the same about the food! Their hummus is fantastic, as is their falafel and lentil soup. For lunch, my favorite thing is the kefta kabob, which comes with hummus, rice, and grilled vegetables. Delish! Mohammed et al. are very courteous, and, when I have ordered takeout, the orders have always been completed promptly. I hope this place makes it. After all, where else can you tell a dining partner to meet you ""in de Nile""? Go ahead. Say it out loud. You'll get it."
The Nile,hummus,"It was a rainy day and my mother and I were starving. I checked yelp to see what we were nearby that was good. The Nile showed up right next to where we were. It was Mediterranean and super close by. When we got there the place was open but empty. The server was eating at one of the tables , I think we might've interrupted his lunch. Once he saw that we were entering he quickly sat us and quickly took our order. Everything was very quick. The hummus was yummy. I had never heard of Egyptian cannoli so I had to try it. It was phenomenal! While the service was decent, it kind of felt like he was trying to rush us out of there. I would definitely go back as the food was fantastic!"
The Nile,hummus,"Great Arabic food.  

Good service and delicious food. I especially like the hummus and falafel. 

The location is a nondescript strip mall on Odana, which is nice enough instead but not  that spectacular. 

I admit that I'm biased towards Middle Eastern food."
The Nile,hummus,"Great menu. location is out of the way, but place is very clean and easy to get to.  Parking is totally convienent. Music, decor was on par. Good service, extremely polite. Menu was solid. Hummus was so-so. Pita was good. Had the grilled platter for 2 and loved it. Water was infused with orange blossom, always a nice touch."
The Nile,hummus,"Great place, whether it's lunch or dinner time. Hummus is to die for! Just a warning though - the kebabs are a bit spicy for those who don't tolerate any spice at all. Really recommend to check this place out."
The Nile,hummus,"I went here with two dining companions.  One who is your typical knuckle dragging, meat eater Wisconsinite, (let the flaming begin) and one who is on the fence between vegetarianism and eating things that had a face.  

Our meat eater had a spicy hamburger dish served atop hummus.  He didn't like it, and he wouldn't ever go back of his own free will.    

The fence rider had the same thing I had which was the vegetarian delight, consisting of hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and falafel.  She tried all three but only really ate the falafel and copious amounts of pita bread dipped in oil.  

I really enjoyed my plate, apparently I was the odd one out this time around.  But it was a refreshing change from the usual pizza/burger/steak joints found all over the place.  

Service was exceptional!"
The Nile,hummus,"The food at the Nile was ok. Their falafels were pretty good though I wish they were served with hummus instead of the tasteless yogurt sauce. Their hummus is also pretty good though the rice that came with the chicken kebab was REALLY salty. The chicken was tender with ok flavor - missing some taste. 

BEWARE - we were charged a 20% gratuity for lunch for 3 people. I have never seen that before for 3. Yes, it is more common for groups of 6 or more but this was weird. 

We will never go back."
The Nile,hummus,"Food is good and fresh but kind of over priced. $5.50 for a tiny plate of hummus with one piece of pita cut up is a bit extreme. The average cost of making hummus in bulk is around $0.95. Fill the plate up. 

Expect dinner prices to be between $12-22. Vegetarian dishes are all $11.95 and are quite filling, but I'd have loved to try the lamb or chicken. $16.95 a plate is just a bit much, if the vegetarian portions are anything to judge off of. 

We were the only two diners, which was slightly daunting, but we did come in right between the lunch and dinner rush, around 3:30-4pm. So service was good. 

All in all I'd return, but we came under the expectation that the price would be lower. On yelp it shows as $$ when realistically it's closer to $$$. However, that's a yelp problem, not the restaurant. Plates between $11-$30 are not 2 dollar signs. Their reasonable price and mine differ greatly."
The Nile,hummus,"Very underwhelming. Nothing was very fresh or flavorful, portions were stingy, item left out from my takeout order. Falafel was tiny and stale, ditto for pita. Hummus and baba weren't flavorful- it was almost hard to tell which was which. Not recommended which is too bad because I'd love to find a west side falafel place to go to all the time! If you're close to campus Naf Naf is actually a pretty good falafel option. I feel bad recommending it because it's a mini-chain/completely not authentic but it's fresh, delicious and consistent."
The Nile,hummus,"Set-up: group of 15 for a birthday party, by reservation, and acknowledgement that ""yes, we can handle your large group."" Smoky (food) atmosphere upon entry. One other large group and maybe 3-4 other small tables occupied. 

Great (as in best in Madison):
Chicken shawirma - seasoned just right, salt, pepper, cinnamon? or cardamum? paparika. 
Tabouli salad - was amazing, but it's the more leafy variety than I've noticed in Madison.  Mostly finely chopped parsley and mint leaves with a sprinkle of bulgar.
Falafel - mushy chickpea inside with great crunchy (taste the fryer!) outside. 

Decent:
Hummus - pretty good, not the best in Madison, basic, just oil over it, nothing fancy
Baba ghanoush - not very smoked, but nice and creamy with HEAVY garlic and yogurt
Dolma - this might be great, but I personally don't like the grape leaf taste, held together nicely and I wasn't totally put off like I have been at other places.
Yellow split pea soup - nice fall flavors
Lamb kebob - served on rice, good flavors.
Kids all got pita pizza - even the picky eaters ate it.

Bland:
Bisara - blended fava beans with chili, parsley, cumin, etc.... just fell flat, like NO seasoning
Pita - from a grocery store? definitely not made there. No grill flavor or marks. No seasoning.

Weird:
Tomato and feta blended spread - tasted good but more like Italian.
No rice or designated pita for the shawirma.
Stuffed Filet of Salmon - very big portion, looked like a dutch baby pancake stuffed with salmon, rice, cheese, and lobster cream sauce. The dining companion who ordered it, said it tasted ""great.""
Egyptian Canneloni - Looked like a vegetarian lasagna covered in cheese. tasted ""good.""

Fail:
20 min wait for drinks - just went to the bar
30 min wait to order
2 hr wait for food to come out!!!!!!
Would not give us separate checks - even though we asked BEFORE ordering.
Portion size did not match prices.
Fraudulently charged 20% automatic on our bill.
Exact examples of alcohol tickets (to point out obvious charge FRAUD on the tickets):
person #1 - 2 spotted cows ($3.75/one) = $7.94
person #2 - 2 spotted cows = $9.41
person #3 - 1 malbec ($6.50/glass) = $8.54
person #4 - 1 pinot ($7.00/glass) = $ 7.39
And that was just on DRINKS! That we had to walk to the bar! Some paid with cash and other with card. PS. both wine pours were MAYBE 3 oz.

They did give us free baklava for the long wait (after we complained) - but it was not good. I can't believe I'm writing this, but it was bland. No honey, pecan filling could have been anything, and some pieces were burnt.

I won't go back unless I crave that tabouli and shwarmira for lunch. But that's going to be a while. And for those of you reading ""oh that's only because it was a large group,"" I witnessed one couple wait an hour for their food too. Another one waited at least 40 min.

Dear owner - get HELP, you need waiters. And a ventilation system. And be aware of the police for your fraud!"
The Nile,hummus,The food is really salty but delicious! I recommend the mezze to eat as a group family style. The moussaka is to die for but very rich. The baba ganoush and hummus are seriously legit. The soups are good too. The wait staff is very nice!
The Nile,hummus,"It was an impulsive decision to go to The Nile when were hunting for new restaurant in the area we never tried before.

I had my doubts when we arrive in a small complex and the simple sign of the restaurant. But this is the incident where one should not judge an eatery from its facade. They definitely worth trying.

Pro:
- Amazing hummus! (definitely an important indicator for me when going to Mediterranean restaurants)
- Good service

Con:
- Limited menu during the weekends (no sandwiches, just FYI)

I ordered a combination of platter for two, which consists of assortments of meats, shrimps served over yellow jasmine rice. It also comes with pita breads and hummus, as well as a soup as appetizer.

All the food taste very fresh and authentic - particularly the hummus and soups. We tried both the split pea soup, and lentil soup - both did not disappoint. They also provide equal portion for each meat, which is easy to split between my friend and I.

I gave 4 stars, just because the meats was a tad dry to my liking. Overall, it is a great place to visit if you are in the area!"
The Nile,hummus,Really yummy food!  We had the Mixed Grill for two and really enjoyed it!  The hummus was very tasty.  It's not five star because of the service. A smile everyone once in awhile would have gone a long way. But the food was good enough that we'll be back!
The Nile,hummus,"We tried the Nile's food for the first time two weeks ago. Ever since the Shish Cafe closed in Madison we really missed good authentic middle eastern food.So we thought we would try this place.On the one hand I'm thrilled this restaurant exists in Madison because there aren't many options for middle eastern food, on the other hand despite the food being good it was not as good the Shish Cafe. The baba ganoush was very tasty, so much so I couldn't stop eating it. I would say it's a little too heavy on the garlic though, that could be toned down a bit. The lentil soup was only ok, it was much more runny than I would have expected it to be. I would probably skip the soup next time. The hummus was good, as was the shwarma. The side salad was really fresh and had a great dressing, however, it had a lot of parsley in it,I would tone that down just a little too. Surprisingly the French fries that came with the dinner order of gyros were absolutely amazing, crispy and some of the best French fries I've ever had. Probably even the best!I would not have expected to find the best French fries at a middle eastern restaurant. The prices were steep, which I'm guessing might be due to the cost of ingredients, but I think the prices are a bit too high and could be a little lower. Also while the server (who may have also been the owner) was not rude and was polite, he certainly didn't seem overly nice and I didn't necessarily get the impression he appreciated our business which kind of disappointed since we dropped quite a bit of money there. I think this restaurant has the potential to be excellent it just has to make a few improvements to get to that point."
The Nile,hummus,"Food = Amazing.  Would definitely return for any and all of the food I had, but especially the hummus and lamb kebab! 

Service = Having a large group of 10, sitting at a table with lots of space to move around, it was a bit frustrating that our server only communicated and dished out drinks and dishes from one end of the table. It was difficult to hear, and I felt I had to shout my order down the table. Not my favorite style of service.

Atmosphere = My least favorite part of The Nile was that their ventilation seemed to be poor throughout the restaurant. While I didn't notice when we first arrived, eventually the dining area filled with a smoky haze that smelled of cooking oils. Not incredibly appealing!

Ease of Reservation = Almost too easy... I called one to two weeks ahead to reserve a large table for UW Graduation weekend. Staff who answered my call asked for my name and the number of guests. It was a quick exchange, so I worried that the reservation might get lost. Called to confirm two days ahead, and staff on the line took down more information. Once we arrived, we were quickly seated. My advice, especially with large parties, it's worth a call to confirm if you booked a decent amount in advance!

All in all, the food is very much worth the trip."
The Nile,hummus,"We ate here two nights in a row (Friday and Saturday) and were very happy with the food and the service.  Both times we were were seated in a comfy booth.  The decor needs updating but I did like the drama of the black flocked wall paper on the back wall.

The flatbread arrived warm and lightly singed with a plate of seasoned olive oil--a very appealing introduction to the meal.

We ordered the vegetarian platter with hummus, babaganoush, and falafel.  The baba ganoush was the star, extremely flavorful with the hummus a close second.  The falafel was pleasantly nutty and crunchy but was less well seasoned.  But  dipped in the tangy tahini sauce, that became a non-issue. 

The second night I ordered the lamb shank (I might have ordered it the night before but the waiter did not alert us to the specials and we had missed the billboard at the entrance to the restuarant).    It was very tasty, falling off the bone, but just the slightest bit stringy.  It was accompanied by huge mound of rice and a tomato sauce with string beans which reminded me of a lamb dish with stewed okra that I have had at Turkish restaurant in New York. 

The first night my husband ordered the beef shawirma and the second the lamb kebab and kefta combination.  The meats were very tasty and were served with hummus on the side.  The shawirma had a cinnamon? flavor that was very interesting.  

The meals came with soup or salad.  The salad consisted of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green pepper, tomatoes, parsley chopped small.  It was delicious and tasted like tabbouleh salad without the bulgur.  

I wasn't a fan of their diet coke from the fountain--the mix of syrup to soda just wasn't right and it left a nasty taste in my mouth.  The next night I ordered a glass of wine (garnacha) instead and was much happier.  

The waiters were very solicitous on both nights.  When we asked for more bread, it arrived quickly, taking only as long as it took to heat up a new batch in the oven.  

Baklava was the perfect ending to the meal.  We live in Minneapolis but if return  to Madison, we would happily return to the Nile."
The Nile,hummus,"We decided to check out The Nile on a whim when we were looking for new (to us) restaurants in the area.  They did not disappoint!

We got an order of baba ganoush to start, which was delicious and well-plated.  We both got separate orders of beef schwarma and salads.  The salad was ok, but the schwarma was excellent.  Every piece of the plate - the hummus, the beef, and the tzatziki - tasted just as good as it looked (which was pretty dang good).  The beef was perfectly spiced. 

Service was excellent as well - can't say enough good things about our experience.  Much better than our experiences in Greece last March (though I will admit we made some bad tourist trap decisions there).  Can't wait to stop by again!"
The Nile,hummus,"I had to come back and update my review because it has not been good on average. We decided after trying a few items that there was really only one thing that we liked a lot. Tonight, we ordered that item for take out, and it was inedible. The meat seemed old and too chewy. The yogurt sauce was super sour- I couldn't tell if it was spoiled. The hummus was still fine. The pita was whatever. Anyway, we ended up throwing most of it away and deciding it is not worth a return visit."
The Nile,hummus,"Yummy hummus, tasty salad, flavorful chicken shawarma.  And the bread is more like naan, rather than pita from the bag that was sliced into pretty little triangles. 

Went for dinner carryout. Wish I would have went for lunch I would have saved a few bucks. I think my chicken shawarma came out to 14 bucks (ouch!).  My sister ordered the a vegetarian dish, falafel, hummus and baba ghanoush - from her empty plate, I imagine she liked it. I'll go for the lunch next time, hoping it will be cheaper yet filling for my tummy."
The Nile,hummus,"I went here as a part of the vegan meetup group. 

Food was excellent. Dinner included one of the best soups I can remember having (some kind of spicy split pea with an incredible depth of flavor) and a zesty, minty salad drizzled in olive oil. Main courses were a) some kind of zucchini in an oily tomato sauce, b) fava bean stew, c) falafel with hummus, and d) some kind of spinach/ phyllo dish. There was also pita served with the meal.  The zucchini had a great flavor, and while oily, it was not a bad ""oily."" I'm not sure that I would want to eat a whole plate of it but, alongside the rest of the food it had a very fresh, very delicious flavor. The fava beans were by far the best entree, a salty and smoky stew that was very hearty. The spinach pie was definitely an acquired taste--some kind of exotic flavor within the filling that was hard to place and which my girlfriend did not care for--but I ate two helpings. The falafel was amazing, very crisp outside and moist, well-seasoned inside. Maybe as good as Bunky's. 

We were also served a delicious baklava dessert, although the coffee was sadly a bit burnt. My girlfriend had the tea, however, which she described as excellent. 

The service was very good--extremely attentive and willing to please, almost excessively so. It has a much nicer atmosphere inside than you would expect from the strip-mall interior. 

All in all, very good food. Would recommend."
The Nile,hummus,"I love the falafel sandwich. Instead of being a folded pita with a few falafel thrown in, it's rolled making it much easier to eat and the portion of falafel is generous.  The hummus was creamy and delicious. All the ingredients tasted fresh. I also enjoyed the tabbouleh salad and baba ghannoush. The stuffed grape leaves were ok.

I had takeout twice, so I can only comment on the food."
The Nile,hummus,"I adore everything about this restaurant. I came here the other day with my parents, and everything was amazing. 
To start off, the decor of The Nile is adorable and fits with the theme of the restaurant. The baba ghanoush is superb as well as their hummus. 
The Nile also has a great variety of foods for every bodies dietary needs. They have seafood and meat to vegetarian options. 
The service was also top notch. My parents and I felt extremely taken care of. This is the best place for middle eastern food in madison"
The Nile,hummus,Stopped in for lunch today and ordered the hummus and gyro.  Both were very good.  The service was fast and very friendly.  I will be back!
The Nile,hummus,"We were a party of five. Had the mix grill for four and there was plenty to eat. The lamb, beef and shrimp kebab were very juicy and good. The chicken kebab was a bit dry. The hummus, red pepper and baba ganush was awesome. The service was wonderful as well. We had the rice pudding and it was a distinct flavor. Orange blossom and rose water!!!!"
The Nile,hummus,"I don't understand the one star reviews. I went with a group of four on a Saturday night and had a very pleasant experience. 

We began with the vegetarian delight (in the vegetarian entree section). The falafel was crispy and seasoned well. The hummus was creamy. The tabouleh was fresh.

The best dish was the chicken shawarma. The flavor on the chicken was incredible- 7 spices go on it! It's not hot, just crazy flavorful.

The kibbe was dry. Ground beef with spices and onion. 

My eggplant moussaka was flavorful- soft eggplants, béchamel, light tomato sauce, and lots of cheese. It came with a side of rice. I enjoyed it and have lunch for tomorrow. Lots of food! 

The restaurant was not busy, probably because the Badgers were playing! The service was prompt. 

The menu states parties of 6 will be charged  a 20%  gratuity. The reviews saying parties under 6 got charged the gratuity or overcharged for drinks were concerning. I did not have any problems with the bill. Good to double check your bill wherever you go though."
The Nile,hummus,"I would have never thought to pull into this strip mall in search of food. Thank goodness for Yelp! The selection was great with moderate prices and the flavors were fantastic! The hummus and baba ganoush are toddler approved and we loved the Egyptian crepe (so rich...impossible to finish the whole thing). Very nice service, quiet, comfy atmosphere, and generous portions. We will be back."
The Nile,hummus,"Wow! The food here was amazing! Our party of five stopped here in Oct 2013 and we really enjoyed the food. 

We were served plenty of crispy pita bread available when ordering hummus, and it was topped off when our entrees arrived. Next time I am in Madison, this will be one of my stops."
The Nile,hummus,"When they closed Husnu's, we began our quest for Mediterranean food in Madison.  Our search continues.  We were not impressed at The Nile.  The only lamb available on the lunch menu is ground with beef.  I was offered lamb but for twice the cost and off the dinner menu.  The hummus was tasteless.  THe waiter was not well informed on what they serve.  We will not return."
The Nile,hummus,"Went to this restaurant for a weekend dinner. Finger licking mediterranean food :) I ordered the vegetarian platter with hummus, baba ganoush and falafel along with yellow peas soup. Pita was soft and freshly made. Everything tasted awesome. The service was quick and good. 
Only thing I didn't like was the flavored water. I think it's some authentic thing but personally didn't like it and no one gave the alternative of plain water. Other than that very good place. Will go again !!"
The Nile,hummus,"Another one of the those places where some of the food is good, and other stuff must be avoided.

Gyros here is a joke, this is not much different, if at all than the kind in the freezer case at Copps, avoid it, you want decent Gyros in Madison, go to The People's Bakery on the east side, not Parthenon.

Okay, the falafel is good enough to eat, not the best I've had, but works.

Really the best thing I've had is the chicken shawarma sandwich, so this is what I would suggest to you. It's probably closer to 4 stars, maybe 3.75.

The hummus also is very good.

Nile is a worthwhile middle-eastern place for food, they should stop trying to do it all, and just do what they do best."
The Nile,hummus,"We had the house specialty for two: lamb, chicken, beef, and shrimp with hummus, tabouli, and bread was excellent and a fair deal for the price.  Back bottom of menu.  Will definitely be back for more."
The Nile,hummus,"Ordered takeout for two, both Beef shawarma, Enjoyed it, good flavor, hummus was good, both of us enjoyed the food. 
Decor was ok, don't really care if food is decent."
The Nile,hummus,"Good as fuck mediterranean food, especially the hummus. A bit expensive for what you are getting. Fast service. 

There is a reason the service is fast: it's a fucking ghost town. I have never seen more than 1/3 of the restaurant filled. I don't know how they manage to stay in business but it's fine by me as long as they keep pumping out the falafels."
The Nile,hummus,"I would give The Nile 5 stars but am being a bit whiny in my review... 1) Lulu's (where the head chef of The Nile used to be before opening his own place) was within walking distance of my 'hood.  2)  I miss the small, ever changing Arabic grocery that used to be at Lulu's.  3)  Strip mall dining reminds me of the year I lived in S. Florida.  Which if you've ever had to reside there, you are most likely nodding your head in sorrowful understanding.  The Coco Wawa (spicy chicken dish) is large enough to feed two people.  Best hummus ever... creamy & smooth, just how I love it.  Our waiter happily substituted cous cous for rice/fattush salad for the standard house salad when asked if it was possible (Thank you, again, for being so graciously accomodating!).  The pita was soft & pillowy, appeared to be homemade.  Go there.  Now.  You'll forget you're in a strip mall once inside."
The Nile,hummus,Great food .. quick service .. ordered falafel and grill mix for two .. lots of food .. fresh off the grill .. and hummus comes with it which was a plus .. Will definitely come back here n bring more friends
The Nile,hummus,"Love, love, looove the food here.

With a menu full of authentic Mediterranean cuisine, the hardest part will be to decide on what to get.

You also can't really go wrong with anything you pick, as each plate offers a varied selection of food (the hummus and grape leaves are amazing) with full, bold tastes. 

The service wasn't the best, but the food more than made up for that.

I highly recommend the kibbee balls and shawirma combination. Expect to have leftovers, because each portion is massive. Most plates also come with some warm, crispy pita bread.

For an unique dining experienced filled with interesting flavors, definitely give The Nile a chance."
The Nile,hummus,"Delicious food, and the prices are reasonable.  I got the egyptian lentil soup, which I absolutely loved, and the spinach lentil soup, which was good.  The soups were a very decent size, and two of them were too much food.  The hummus plate and pita were fresh and really tasty as well.  Our waiter was very attentive and refilled my water every time I emptied it, which was at least 5 times during the meal."
The Nile,hummus,"Nothing but very good reviews from our party of 12 who dined at the Nile on Tuesday night. We all had very good food, well-seasoned and reasonably priced. I can specifically recommend the sorar, hummus, and tabbouleh and am very eager to try the Nile chicken, spinach cheese pie, and lamb dishes which were enjoyed by some of my companions.  The service was very efficient and we asked for and received separate checks without any problem. We plan to return...soon. Parking was a bit of a challenge, as it seemed to be prime time for classes at the karate school next door."
The Nile,hummus,"Food is good but definitely overpriced. I ordered chicken shawarma and extra side of hummus. Chicken Shawarma comes with hummus and a side of pita. I asked if the extra side of hummus would also come with pita and was told it does.  Upon picking up the order, I was told there's only one pita per order. It took them a while to give me the extra pita I was promised. 

I gave low ratings because the extra side of hummus ($7) was barely 3-4tbsp of hummus. Their hummus is good but I felt ripped off (especially because they were claiming it doesn't come with pita). 

An order of chicken shawarma and hummus came out to be over $23. I've had much better food with greater portions for a much better price."
The Nile,hummus,The best hummus in town!  Everything is always tasty.  The service is good.  My husband's favorite dish is the Nile Chicken.
The Nile,hummus,"Hidden in a nondescript strip mall is one of the few places in Madison where you can get yourself some decent and authentic Arab cuisine. In fact, if you aren't tucked away in a disheveled strip mall with foam ceilings and a drywall/carpet combo from the 90's, I question your authenticity as a legitimate Arab establishment.

The Nile serves up all of the staples of Egyptian cuisine, typically in a tapas small-plate style. Though this seems to vary wildly on each dish, since a $9 bowl of fatteh (garbanzo bean puree) netted me about 100 times as much food as a $5 plate of hummus.

They also tend to put their own flairs on classic Egyptian dishes, changing them quite a bit from what they should be. The dash of cinnamon in the kibbe (fried meatballs) is original, but it does make me pause for a second and think ""this isn't kibbeh!"" And sometimes I just want regular water without rose extract in it.

I don't know if it's a bad thing. I'm no purist but those dishes tend to get spiced the exact same way over and over throughout history for a reason. On some dishes it's a really welcome spin on a familiar taste, on others I just think ""I just want some damn foul (fava beans) without you adding whatever-the-hell-this-is to it."""
The Nile,hummus,Love this place! Great service and awesome food! I especially like their salads and lamb kebabs. Their hummus and bread are amazing as well!
The Nile,hummus,Not a bad little Mediterranean joint. Service is so so. I actually prefer the appetizers and the baklava to the main dishes. The lentil soup and hummus are standouts. Did I mention the baklava.
The Nile,hummus,"Getting the negatives out of the way first, the atmosphere is entirely unremarkable, the music is awful and too loud, and the service can be a bit spotty.

HOWEVER.....the food is absolutely sublime.  I've been there upwards of ten times, and have yet to have anything that was not outstanding. They make the best falafel in town, and I would be proud to serve their hummus at my next dinner party.  

The prices are just right, too.  Lunch seems to be an especially good deal.

So, unless you think form more important than substance, do yourself a favor and hit the Nile for your next meal out.  You will not regret it.

One star withheld for the aforementioned negatives."
The Nile,falafel plate,"I love this place. Excellent vegetarian and vegan options. I'm partial to the spinach pie (which is surprisingly vegan) and vegetarian platter with hummus, falafel and grape leaves (which are the best in Madison in my opinion).

The only negative to this'd place is that the service can be very slow at times. I've come at off hours when we're the only ones there and it takes too long to even get our waters."
The Nile,falafel plate,"After reading the reviews I really wanted to try this place. We went for lunch on a Saturday. Imagine my surprise that there is no lunch menu and lunch was going to set me back a minimum of $15! I ordered an appetizer of falafel, which was the best thing I had, but an additional $5.95. The entree was chicken schwirma, with a side of hummus. I thought the main portion was small and came without rice? That was weird to me, never had it that way before. I even inquired and was just told ""no, it does not come with rice"". No offer to bring me rice. There was one man waiting on the entire place. He seemed a little distracted and maybe irritated, but was cordial to us. I doubt I will go back, I have had better Mediteranean food elsewhere and for less money."
The Nile,falafel plate,"We stopped in for a late lunch and had an excellent experience.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you; this place doesn't disappoint.  The middle eastern coffee was great and we shared a few small plates for our meal.  The beef shawarma is absolutely the best I've ever had!  The falafel, hummus, and lentil soup were flavorful and fresh.  We've been dreaming of the flavors we had since we stopped in.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!"
The Nile,falafel plate,"I am not optimistic about this location, since I was a fan of the previous occupant as well (an Indian restaurant), which obviously didn't survive. The interior is unremarkable, but I can't say the same about the food! Their hummus is fantastic, as is their falafel and lentil soup. For lunch, my favorite thing is the kefta kabob, which comes with hummus, rice, and grilled vegetables. Delish! Mohammed et al. are very courteous, and, when I have ordered takeout, the orders have always been completed promptly. I hope this place makes it. After all, where else can you tell a dining partner to meet you ""in de Nile""? Go ahead. Say it out loud. You'll get it."
The Nile,falafel plate,"Great Arabic food.  

Good service and delicious food. I especially like the hummus and falafel. 

The location is a nondescript strip mall on Odana, which is nice enough instead but not  that spectacular. 

I admit that I'm biased towards Middle Eastern food."
The Nile,falafel plate,"I went here with two dining companions.  One who is your typical knuckle dragging, meat eater Wisconsinite, (let the flaming begin) and one who is on the fence between vegetarianism and eating things that had a face.  

Our meat eater had a spicy hamburger dish served atop hummus.  He didn't like it, and he wouldn't ever go back of his own free will.    

The fence rider had the same thing I had which was the vegetarian delight, consisting of hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and falafel.  She tried all three but only really ate the falafel and copious amounts of pita bread dipped in oil.  

I really enjoyed my plate, apparently I was the odd one out this time around.  But it was a refreshing change from the usual pizza/burger/steak joints found all over the place.  

Service was exceptional!"
The Nile,falafel plate,"Food is good and fresh but kind of over priced. $5.50 for a tiny plate of hummus with one piece of pita cut up is a bit extreme. The average cost of making hummus in bulk is around $0.95. Fill the plate up. 

Expect dinner prices to be between $12-22. Vegetarian dishes are all $11.95 and are quite filling, but I'd have loved to try the lamb or chicken. $16.95 a plate is just a bit much, if the vegetarian portions are anything to judge off of. 

We were the only two diners, which was slightly daunting, but we did come in right between the lunch and dinner rush, around 3:30-4pm. So service was good. 

All in all I'd return, but we came under the expectation that the price would be lower. On yelp it shows as $$ when realistically it's closer to $$$. However, that's a yelp problem, not the restaurant. Plates between $11-$30 are not 2 dollar signs. Their reasonable price and mine differ greatly."
The Nile,falafel plate,"Very underwhelming. Nothing was very fresh or flavorful, portions were stingy, item left out from my takeout order. Falafel was tiny and stale, ditto for pita. Hummus and baba weren't flavorful- it was almost hard to tell which was which. Not recommended which is too bad because I'd love to find a west side falafel place to go to all the time! If you're close to campus Naf Naf is actually a pretty good falafel option. I feel bad recommending it because it's a mini-chain/completely not authentic but it's fresh, delicious and consistent."
The Nile,falafel plate,"We ate here two nights in a row (Friday and Saturday) and were very happy with the food and the service.  Both times we were were seated in a comfy booth.  The decor needs updating but I did like the drama of the black flocked wall paper on the back wall.

Loved the falafel, which isn't hard because it is my favorite food! Would defiantly suggest this place! My boyfriend loved his lentil soup and Schwartz and my mom throughly enjoyed her lamb!"

The service wasn't the best, but the food more than made up for that.

I highly recommend the kibbee balls and shawirma combination. Expect to have leftovers, because each portion is massive. Most plates also come with some warm, crispy pita bread.

For an unique dining experienced filled with interesting flavors, definitely give The Nile a chance."
The Nile,falafel plate,"Delicious food, and the prices are reasonable.  I got the egyptian lentil soup, which I absolutely loved, and the spinach lentil soup, which was good.  The soups were a very decent size, and two of them were too much food.  The hummus plate and pita were fresh and really tasty as well.  Our waiter was very attentive and refilled my water every time I emptied it, which was at least 5 times during the meal."
The Nile,falafel plate,"Hidden in a nondescript strip mall is one of the few places in Madison where you can get yourself some decent and authentic Arab cuisine. In fact, if you aren't tucked away in a disheveled strip mall with foam ceilings and a drywall/carpet combo from the 90's, I question your authenticity as a legitimate Arab establishment.

The Nile serves up all of the staples of Egyptian cuisine, typically in a tapas small-plate style. Though this seems to vary wildly on each dish, since a $9 bowl of fatteh (garbanzo bean puree) netted me about 100 times as much food as a $5 plate of hummus.

They also tend to put their own flairs on classic Egyptian dishes, changing them quite a bit from what they should be. The dash of cinnamon in the kibbe (fried meatballs) is original, but it does make me pause for a second and think ""this isn't kibbeh!"" And sometimes I just want regular water without rose extract in it.

I don't know if it's a bad thing. I'm no purist but those dishes tend to get spiced the exact same way over and over throughout history for a reason. On some dishes it's a really welcome spin on a familiar taste, on others I just think ""I just want some damn foul (fava beans) without you adding whatever-the-hell-this-is to it."""
The Nile,falafel plate,"Getting the negatives out of the way first, the atmosphere is entirely unremarkable, the music is awful and too loud, and the service can be a bit spotty.

HOWEVER.....the food is absolutely sublime.  I've been there upwards of ten times, and have yet to have anything that was not outstanding. They make the best falafel in town, and I would be proud to serve their hummus at my next dinner party.  

The prices are just right, too.  Lunch seems to be an especially good deal.

So, unless you think form more important than substance, do yourself a favor and hit the Nile for your next meal out.  You will not regret it.

One star withheld for the aforementioned negatives."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I love this place. Excellent vegetarian and vegan options. I'm partial to the spinach pie (which is surprisingly vegan) and vegetarian platter with hummus, falafel and grape leaves (which are the best in Madison in my opinion).

The only negative to this'd place is that the service can be very slow at times. I've come at off hours when we're the only ones there and it takes too long to even get our waters."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"After reading the reviews I really wanted to try this place. We went for lunch on a Saturday. Imagine my surprise that there is no lunch menu and lunch was going to set me back a minimum of $15! I ordered an appetizer of falafel, which was the best thing I had, but an additional $5.95. The entree was chicken schwirma, with a side of hummus. I thought the main portion was small and came without rice? That was weird to me, never had it that way before. I even inquired and was just told ""no, it does not come with rice"". No offer to bring me rice. There was one man waiting on the entire place. He seemed a little distracted and maybe irritated, but was cordial to us. I doubt I will go back, I have had better Mediteranean food elsewhere and for less money."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"We stopped in for a late lunch and had an excellent experience.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you; this place doesn't disappoint.  The middle eastern coffee was great and we shared a few small plates for our meal.  The beef shawarma is absolutely the best I've ever had!  The falafel, hummus, and lentil soup were flavorful and fresh.  We've been dreaming of the flavors we had since we stopped in.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I am not optimistic about this location, since I was a fan of the previous occupant as well (an Indian restaurant), which obviously didn't survive. The interior is unremarkable, but I can't say the same about the food! Their hummus is fantastic, as is their falafel and lentil soup. For lunch, my favorite thing is the kefta kabob, which comes with hummus, rice, and grilled vegetables. Delish! Mohammed et al. are very courteous, and, when I have ordered takeout, the orders have always been completed promptly. I hope this place makes it. After all, where else can you tell a dining partner to meet you ""in de Nile""? Go ahead. Say it out loud. You'll get it."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"It was a rainy day and my mother and I were starving. I checked yelp to see what we were nearby that was good. The Nile showed up right next to where we were. It was Mediterranean and super close by. When we got there the place was open but empty. The server was eating at one of the tables , I think we might've interrupted his lunch. Once he saw that we were entering he quickly sat us and quickly took our order. Everything was very quick. The hummus was yummy. I had never heard of Egyptian cannoli so I had to try it. It was phenomenal! While the service was decent, it kind of felt like he was trying to rush us out of there. I would definitely go back as the food was fantastic!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"We went here today for lunch and have been here in the past, and it was great.  Today, we were the only people in the restaurant when we sat down.   50 minutes later we had no food (our order was 2 falafel sandwiches- not complicated), and people who had entered after us had been eating for about 5-10 minutes.  A to-go order that was placed 20 minutes after we arrived was served by the time we walked out.  I have never seen people walk out of restaurant before, except on television.  I never thought I'd be walking out of one.

This is truly unfortunate as I work less than 2 blocks away and had a great first experience, and would love to go here at least once a week.  But after not being served and completely wasting my lunch break on my /birthday/, I won't be going here again."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Great Arabic food.  

Good service and delicious food. I especially like the hummus and falafel. 

The location is a nondescript strip mall on Odana, which is nice enough instead but not  that spectacular. 

I admit that I'm biased towards Middle Eastern food."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I went here for lunch with co-workers and the food was very good. I had the falafel sandwich and ordered a bowl of the Egyptian lentil soup. The soup was wonderful, creamy and flavorful. The sandwich was very good, but it could have had a side of tahini or some additional dressing."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Great place, whether it's lunch or dinner time. Hummus is to die for! Just a warning though - the kebabs are a bit spicy for those who don't tolerate any spice at all. Really recommend to check this place out."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I went here with two dining companions.  One who is your typical knuckle dragging, meat eater Wisconsinite, (let the flaming begin) and one who is on the fence between vegetarianism and eating things that had a face.  

Our meat eater had a spicy hamburger dish served atop hummus.  He didn't like it, and he wouldn't ever go back of his own free will.    

The fence rider had the same thing I had which was the vegetarian delight, consisting of hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and falafel.  She tried all three but only really ate the falafel and copious amounts of pita bread dipped in oil.  

I really enjoyed my plate, apparently I was the odd one out this time around.  But it was a refreshing change from the usual pizza/burger/steak joints found all over the place.  

Service was exceptional!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Four stars for the amazing food. The fifth star not given for the price.

Ok, so I've been dining here for awhile. I almost always go around lunch time. They're almost always dead. Either my group is the only group or there's only one other. It's sad, because they're really good. More people need to know about this place. I've tried spreading the word, but my friends never seem to be interested in checking it out. I've only gotten a few people to eat here, but when they do they're hooked!

I wish I could remember the first sandwich I got here. I keep trying to figure it out, but I never have been able to. It was easily one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Every other sandwich has been fantastic, so my exploration of the menu hasn't been a bad one.

One of my favorite things here is the rose or lavender water, depending on the day. I love it so much. I had to go out and get a bottle of rose water so that I could have it at home.

The look of the place is great. I envy the fancy section that seems to be closed off during the day. I would love to be able come back here some time for the belly dancing, but I always end up going to the hookah lounge."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"The food at the Nile was ok. Their falafels were pretty good though I wish they were served with hummus instead of the tasteless yogurt sauce. Their hummus is also pretty good though the rice that came with the chicken kebab was REALLY salty. The chicken was tender with ok flavor - missing some taste. 

BEWARE - we were charged a 20% gratuity for lunch for 3 people. I have never seen that before for 3. Yes, it is more common for groups of 6 or more but this was weird. 

We will never go back."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Food is good and fresh but kind of over priced. $5.50 for a tiny plate of hummus with one piece of pita cut up is a bit extreme. The average cost of making hummus in bulk is around $0.95. Fill the plate up. 

Expect dinner prices to be between $12-22. Vegetarian dishes are all $11.95 and are quite filling, but I'd have loved to try the lamb or chicken. $16.95 a plate is just a bit much, if the vegetarian portions are anything to judge off of. 

We were the only two diners, which was slightly daunting, but we did come in right between the lunch and dinner rush, around 3:30-4pm. So service was good. 

All in all I'd return, but we came under the expectation that the price would be lower. On yelp it shows as $$ when realistically it's closer to $$$. However, that's a yelp problem, not the restaurant. Plates between $11-$30 are not 2 dollar signs. Their reasonable price and mine differ greatly."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Very underwhelming. Nothing was very fresh or flavorful, portions were stingy, item left out from my takeout order. Falafel was tiny and stale, ditto for pita. Hummus and baba weren't flavorful- it was almost hard to tell which was which. Not recommended which is too bad because I'd love to find a west side falafel place to go to all the time! If you're close to campus Naf Naf is actually a pretty good falafel option. I feel bad recommending it because it's a mini-chain/completely not authentic but it's fresh, delicious and consistent."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Set-up: group of 15 for a birthday party, by reservation, and acknowledgement that ""yes, we can handle your large group."" Smoky (food) atmosphere upon entry. One other large group and maybe 3-4 other small tables occupied. 

Great (as in best in Madison):
Chicken shawirma - seasoned just right, salt, pepper, cinnamon? or cardamum? paparika. 
Tabouli salad - was amazing, but it's the more leafy variety than I've noticed in Madison.  Mostly finely chopped parsley and mint leaves with a sprinkle of bulgar.
Falafel - mushy chickpea inside with great crunchy (taste the fryer!) outside. 

Decent:
Hummus - pretty good, not the best in Madison, basic, just oil over it, nothing fancy
Baba ghanoush - not very smoked, but nice and creamy with HEAVY garlic and yogurt
Dolma - this might be great, but I personally don't like the grape leaf taste, held together nicely and I wasn't totally put off like I have been at other places.
Yellow split pea soup - nice fall flavors
Lamb kebob - served on rice, good flavors.
Kids all got pita pizza - even the picky eaters ate it.

Bland:
Bisara - blended fava beans with chili, parsley, cumin, etc.... just fell flat, like NO seasoning
Pita - from a grocery store? definitely not made there. No grill flavor or marks. No seasoning.

Weird:
Tomato and feta blended spread - tasted good but more like Italian.
No rice or designated pita for the shawirma.
Stuffed Filet of Salmon - very big portion, looked like a dutch baby pancake stuffed with salmon, rice, cheese, and lobster cream sauce. The dining companion who ordered it, said it tasted ""great.""
Egyptian Canneloni - Looked like a vegetarian lasagna covered in cheese. tasted ""good.""

Fail:
20 min wait for drinks - just went to the bar
30 min wait to order
2 hr wait for food to come out!!!!!!
Would not give us separate checks - even though we asked BEFORE ordering.
Portion size did not match prices.
Fraudulently charged 20% automatic on our bill.
Exact examples of alcohol tickets (to point out obvious charge FRAUD on the tickets):
person #1 - 2 spotted cows ($3.75/one) = $7.94
person #2 - 2 spotted cows = $9.41
person #3 - 1 malbec ($6.50/glass) = $8.54
person #4 - 1 pinot ($7.00/glass) = $ 7.39
And that was just on DRINKS! That we had to walk to the bar! Some paid with cash and other with card. PS. both wine pours were MAYBE 3 oz.

They did give us free baklava for the long wait (after we complained) - but it was not good. I can't believe I'm writing this, but it was bland. No honey, pecan filling could have been anything, and some pieces were burnt.

I won't go back unless I crave that tabouli and shwarmira for lunch. But that's going to be a while. And for those of you reading ""oh that's only because it was a large group,"" I witnessed one couple wait an hour for their food too. Another one waited at least 40 min.

Dear owner - get HELP, you need waiters. And a ventilation system. And be aware of the police for your fraud!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Ate at The Nile last night. It was Memorial Day and the restaurant was quite empty around 6:30 pm. There were four of us and we sat at a nice sized round table right near the bar. No one was at the bar so it felt quiet and private.
My partner and I passed on ordering an appetizer but the other couple we were with had the felafel. They loved the patties which were flavorful and not too heavy or dry. It was a good serving to share.
All of our entrees were delicious. The special of the evening was a lamb shank cooked in a tomato sauce served with green beans, The meat fell from the bone and was fairly tasty. I thought the sauce could have been more generously seasoned. One of my companions had a salmon dish which she really loved. She had it with rice and salad. Also served was the spinach pie. Four nice sized squares of golden brown stuffed phyllo dough. The filling was light and delicious. I love to cook but this is not something I would make at home. I plan to order this the next time I return.

....That is if I can hold myself back from ordering the Moussaka. I had eaten this lovely dish before at The Nile and I refused to order anything else. The eggplant is so well seasoned, a bit spicy and topped with an ooey-gooey cheese that is held under a flame to create a slight crust. This was also served with rice.

We left the restaurant with full tummies and a doggie bag. I just ate my eggplant for lunch and it tasted even better the second time around!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"We ate here two nights in a row (Friday and Saturday) and were very happy with the food and the service.  Both times we were were seated in a comfy booth.  The decor needs updating but I did like the drama of the black flocked wall paper on the back wall.

The flatbread arrived warm and lightly singed with a plate of seasoned olive oil--a very appealing introduction to the meal.

We ordered the vegetarian platter with hummus, babaganoush, and falafel.  The baba ganoush was the star, extremely flavorful with the hummus a close second.  The falafel was pleasantly nutty and crunchy but was less well seasoned.  But  dipped in the tangy tahini sauce, that became a non-issue. 

The second night I ordered the lamb shank (I might have ordered it the night before but the waiter did not alert us to the specials and we had missed the billboard at the entrance to the restuarant).    It was very tasty, falling off the bone, but just the slightest bit stringy.  It was accompanied by huge mound of rice and a tomato sauce with string beans which reminded me of a lamb dish with stewed okra that I have had at Turkish restaurant in New York. 

The first night my husband ordered the beef shawirma and the second the lamb kebab and kefta combination.  The meats were very tasty and were served with hummus on the side.  The shawirma had a cinnamon? flavor that was very interesting.  

The meals came with soup or salad.  The salad consisted of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green pepper, tomatoes, parsley chopped small.  It was delicious and tasted like tabbouleh salad without the bulgur.  

I wasn't a fan of their diet coke from the fountain--the mix of syrup to soda just wasn't right and it left a nasty taste in my mouth.  The next night I ordered a glass of wine (garnacha) instead and was much happier.  

The waiters were very solicitous on both nights.  When we asked for more bread, it arrived quickly, taking only as long as it took to heat up a new batch in the oven.  

Baklava was the perfect ending to the meal.  We live in Minneapolis but if return  to Madison, we would happily return to the Nile."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Ordered out. The falafel pita sandwich is done like a tortilla wrap, and the 'tahini' dressing is more spicy than flavorful. Definitely far behind the Banzo F-bomb in flavor. On other occasions, the Nile chicken is great. Also had a delicious special of salmon and rice. However, not convinced it is worth the price."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Yummy hummus, tasty salad, flavorful chicken shawarma.  And the bread is more like naan, rather than pita from the bag that was sliced into pretty little triangles. 

Went for dinner carryout. Wish I would have went for lunch I would have saved a few bucks. I think my chicken shawarma came out to 14 bucks (ouch!).  My sister ordered the a vegetarian dish, falafel, hummus and baba ghanoush - from her empty plate, I imagine she liked it. I'll go for the lunch next time, hoping it will be cheaper yet filling for my tummy."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I went here as a part of the vegan meetup group. 

Food was excellent. Dinner included one of the best soups I can remember having (some kind of spicy split pea with an incredible depth of flavor) and a zesty, minty salad drizzled in olive oil. Main courses were a) some kind of zucchini in an oily tomato sauce, b) fava bean stew, c) falafel with hummus, and d) some kind of spinach/ phyllo dish. There was also pita served with the meal.  The zucchini had a great flavor, and while oily, it was not a bad ""oily."" I'm not sure that I would want to eat a whole plate of it but, alongside the rest of the food it had a very fresh, very delicious flavor. The fava beans were by far the best entree, a salty and smoky stew that was very hearty. The spinach pie was definitely an acquired taste--some kind of exotic flavor within the filling that was hard to place and which my girlfriend did not care for--but I ate two helpings. The falafel was amazing, very crisp outside and moist, well-seasoned inside. Maybe as good as Bunky's. 

We were also served a delicious baklava dessert, although the coffee was sadly a bit burnt. My girlfriend had the tea, however, which she described as excellent. 

The service was very good--extremely attentive and willing to please, almost excessively so. It has a much nicer atmosphere inside than you would expect from the strip-mall interior. 

All in all, very good food. Would recommend."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I love the falafel sandwich. Instead of being a folded pita with a few falafel thrown in, it's rolled making it much easier to eat and the portion of falafel is generous.  The hummus was creamy and delicious. All the ingredients tasted fresh. I also enjoyed the tabbouleh salad and baba ghannoush. The stuffed grape leaves were ok.

I had takeout twice, so I can only comment on the food."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Love the kefta and shawirma but the rose water they serve is a bit strong for our tastes. We've been for lunch and for dinner with no problem being seated. Lunch seemed to be slightly more flavorful. They are heavy on onions, fyi.  A favorite when we are craving mediterranean meats."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,Stopped in for lunch today and ordered the hummus and gyro.  Both were very good.  The service was fast and very friendly.  I will be back!
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Best falafel I've ever had. Excellent service, the food came out fast, and overall it was an awesome experience. This has now become our favorite spot in town!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,Spread the word about this place because it is DELICIOUS! The staff is always so welcoming and friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a quiet lunch or dinner. The only thing that I think goes against The Nile is the location. This place should move downtown to increase their customers. Will always come here!
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I don't understand the one star reviews. I went with a group of four on a Saturday night and had a very pleasant experience. 

We began with the vegetarian delight (in the vegetarian entree section). The falafel was crispy and seasoned well. The hummus was creamy. The tabouleh was fresh.

The best dish was the chicken shawarma. The flavor on the chicken was incredible- 7 spices go on it! It's not hot, just crazy flavorful.

The kibbe was dry. Ground beef with spices and onion. 

My eggplant moussaka was flavorful- soft eggplants, béchamel, light tomato sauce, and lots of cheese. It came with a side of rice. I enjoyed it and have lunch for tomorrow. Lots of food! 

The restaurant was not busy, probably because the Badgers were playing! The service was prompt. 

The menu states parties of 6 will be charged  a 20%  gratuity. The reviews saying parties under 6 got charged the gratuity or overcharged for drinks were concerning. I did not have any problems with the bill. Good to double check your bill wherever you go though."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"I love the Nile for lunch so I decided to try them for dinner. I tried something new tonight and was not fond of it. It seemed to be mostly cheese. When I thought about how few vegetables I had I realized that my salad was forgotten. My fault for not remembering earlier, but I was also one of two tables so should have been easy getting everything in my order. I very much regret my dinner choice and will not be returning for awhile and I will only return at lunch and stick with items that do not have cheese."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"In short:

Poor service
Decent food

The experience was odd, when we arrived for lunch at 1pm, we were given dinner menus. Then when seated and after we had decide what we wanted to order, our party of 3 was informed that there was an obligatory 20% gratuity, despite the back of the menu saying this only applied to parties of 6 or more.

While I certainly don't have a problem tipping for good service, I can't can help but feel that I was somewhat misled. Any such requirements should have been stated ahead of time, not been contrary to the menu and should not have been mentioned when we were placing orders.

The food quality was slightly above average, however the portions were smaller than what we expected - especially for dinner rates. While the rates were somewhat reasonable, I couldn't help walking away feeling squeezed for money.

We won't be returning."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"When they closed Husnu's, we began our quest for Mediterranean food in Madison.  Our search continues.  We were not impressed at The Nile.  The only lamb available on the lunch menu is ground with beef.  I was offered lamb but for twice the cost and off the dinner menu.  The hummus was tasteless.  THe waiter was not well informed on what they serve.  We will not return."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Went to this restaurant for a weekend dinner. Finger licking mediterranean food :) I ordered the vegetarian platter with hummus, baba ganoush and falafel along with yellow peas soup. Pita was soft and freshly made. Everything tasted awesome. The service was quick and good. 
Only thing I didn't like was the flavored water. I think it's some authentic thing but personally didn't like it and no one gave the alternative of plain water. Other than that very good place. Will go again !!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,Very impressed from my one lunchtime visit.  Best falafel I have ever had!  Will definitely try again.
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"The dip they gave us at the beginning of the meal to dip our pita in was amazing! We all loved it! The workers were friendly, asked how our meal was! Loved the falafel, which isn't hard because it is my favorite food! Would defiantly suggest this place! My boyfriend loved his lentil soup and Schwartz and my mom throughly enjoyed her lamb!"
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,The food is fresh and authentic. I tried falafel and stuffed grape leaves which were very tasty.
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Another one of the those places where some of the food is good, and other stuff must be avoided.

Gyros here is a joke, this is not much different, if at all than the kind in the freezer case at Copps, avoid it, you want decent Gyros in Madison, go to The People's Bakery on the east side, not Parthenon.

Okay, the falafel is good enough to eat, not the best I've had, but works.

Really the best thing I've had is the chicken shawarma sandwich, so this is what I would suggest to you. It's probably closer to 4 stars, maybe 3.75.

The hummus also is very good.

Nile is a worthwhile middle-eastern place for food, they should stop trying to do it all, and just do what they do best."
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,Great food .. quick service .. ordered falafel and grill mix for two .. lots of food .. fresh off the grill .. and hummus comes with it which was a plus .. Will definitely come back here n bring more friends
The Nile,lunch falafel sandwich,"Getting the negatives out of the way first, the atmosphere is entirely unremarkable, the music is awful and too loud, and the service can be a bit spotty.

HOWEVER.....the food is absolutely sublime.  I've been there upwards of ten times, and have yet to have anything that was not outstanding. They make the best falafel in town, and I would be proud to serve their hummus at my next dinner party.  

The prices are just right, too.  Lunch seems to be an especially good deal.

So, unless you think form more important than substance, do yourself a favor and hit the Nile for your next meal out.  You will not regret it.

One star withheld for the aforementioned negatives."
Asian House,shrimp with chinese vegetables,"We order from this place all the time.  It's good, and they deliver in like two seconds after you order.  It's nothing fancy, but it's good Chinese, and they will accommodate your special requests."
Asian House,shrimp with chinese vegetables,"My fella and I recently ordered for delivery from here and it was good! The delivery took a little over an hour - which is fine by me. The food came hot so that's all that matters.

We ordered crab rangoons (free with coupon), Mongolian beef, Dragon & Phoenix, appetizer of fried bean curd with garlic sauce. Everything with a $1 delivery fee & $5 tip came to $30 - not bad at all. 

The rangoons were okay - best with sauce around the crispy edges. The bean curd was okay as well - lightly fried and decent size pieces, although the garlic sauce, while flavorful, seemed thin. My fella love the Mongolian beef and I too thought the dish had a lot going for it. The Dragon & Phoenix was okay - the chicken was not my favorite so I probably would not get that again but the shrimp more than made up for it. Those were some of the best shrimp I have ever eaten from a take-out place. I definitely would be willing to try some more options from their seafood side. 

Also worth noting, the portions were huge! Way more than enough and at a very good price to boot! 

I'll definitely go here again the next time I get an urge to eat as much as possible while moving as little as possible."
Asian House,shrimp with chinese vegetables,"The search for decent Chinese takeout in Madison continues. The food at this place (we ordered delivery) is nothing worth waiting 1.5 hours for. Greasy vegetable egg rolls which contain nothing but cabbage. Greasy lo mein. They clearly do not understand how to work with tofu, nor do they get how to deliver quality food in a timely fashion. The one plus was the vegetables were still crunchy. Just save your time and money and don't bother. Not even a good dousing of sriraccha can make their ho-hum food sparkle. The reviews I've seen from in-house diners do not provide any contrast to our delivery experience."
Asian House,shrimp with chinese vegetables,Curry tofu is amazing. Good fresh Chinese better than a lot of takeout places. Disclaimer- have spent a month in China.
Asian House,shrimp with chinese vegetables,"Waited an hour and 20 minutes for my order to be delivered, and when the driver got there I had to meet him outside. He refused to come to my apartment. Meat portions were small, I ordered a shrimp dinner. 4 pieces of shrimp and minimal beef with my beef and mushroom.

Tasted Okay...."
Asian House,shrimp with chinese vegetables,"Another in a seemingly endless series of completely shitty, cookie-cuter Chinese restaurants.  The food at this place makes Panda Garden look like a *REAL* Chinese restaurant.  The ""potstickers"" are really ""deep fryer"" stickers and are so glutenous you could use them to plug holes in your boat.  There is nothing even remotely authentic or even edible in this armpit.

Avoid Asian House like the plague. Thoroughly vile.  If you would like a REAL, AUTHENTIC Chinese meal, head over to Ichiban on Park Street.  That place will knock your socks off.

If you ever find yourself thinking about eating here, head up the street to McDonalds where the food is both more nutritious and has more flavor."

Greasy vegetable egg rolls which contain nothing but cabbage. Greasy lo mein. They clearly do not understand how to work with tofu, nor do they get how to deliver quality food in a timely fashion. The one plus was the vegetables were still crunchy. Just save your time and money and don't bother. Not even a good dousing of sriraccha can make their ho-hum food sparkle. The reviews I've seen from in-house diners do not provide any contrast to our delivery experience."
Asian House,beef with chinese vegetables,Curry tofu is amazing. Good fresh Chinese better than a lot of takeout places. Disclaimer- have spent a month in China.
Asian House,beef with chinese vegetables,"Waited an hour and 20 minutes for my order to be delivered, and when the driver got there I had to meet him outside. He refused to come to my apartment. Meat portions were small, I ordered a shrimp dinner. 4 pieces of shrimp and minimal beef with my beef and mushroom.

Tasted Okay...."
Asian House,beef with chinese vegetables,"Another in a seemingly endless series of completely shitty, cookie-cuter Chinese restaurants.  The food at this place makes Panda Garden look like a *REAL* Chinese restaurant.  The ""potstickers"" are really ""deep fryer"" stickers and are so glutenous you could use them to plug holes in your boat.  There is nothing even remotely authentic or even edible in this armpit.

Avoid Asian House like the plague. Thoroughly vile.  If you would like a REAL, AUTHENTIC Chinese meal, head over to Ichiban on Park Street.  That place will knock your socks off.

If you ever find yourself thinking about eating here, head up the street to McDonalds where the food is both more nutritious and has more flavor."
Asian House,chicken with chinese vegetables,"We order from this place all the time.  It's good, and they deliver in like two seconds after you order.  It's nothing fancy, but it's good Chinese, and they will accommodate your special requests."
Asian House,chicken with chinese vegetables,Not good food. General Tsos chicken and sesame chicken were indistinguishable. Steamed dumplings are actually gross. Fried rice seems to be purchased as is and then steamed.
Asian House,chicken with chinese vegetables,"My fella and I recently ordered for delivery from here and it was good! The delivery took a little over an hour - which is fine by me. The food came hot so that's all that matters.

We ordered crab rangoons (free with coupon), Mongolian beef, Dragon & Phoenix, appetizer of fried bean curd with garlic sauce. Everything with a $1 delivery fee & $5 tip came to $30 - not bad at all. 

The rangoons were okay - best with sauce around the crispy edges. The bean curd was okay as well - lightly fried and decent size pieces, although the garlic sauce, while flavorful, seemed thin. My fella love the Mongolian beef and I too thought the dish had a lot going for it. The Dragon & Phoenix was okay - the chicken was not my favorite so I probably would not get that again but the shrimp more than made up for it. Those were some of the best shrimp I have ever eaten from a take-out place. I definitely would be willing to try some more options from their seafood side. 

Also worth noting, the portions were huge! Way more than enough and at a very good price to boot! 

I'll definitely go here again the next time I get an urge to eat as much as possible while moving as little as possible."

Asian House,chicken with chinese vegetables,"Ordered for take-out. They answered the phones promptly, were very polite and quick. Only 10 minutes until my food would be ready!

Perhaps it's just me not being familiar with the area, but their location was a bit hard to find. The physical building itself is tucked back without all that noticeable of a sign-I went right by it the first time. 

Upon entering I was greeted by two workers-they were so polite! Big smiles on their faces and greeted me very kindly. 

Prices here are fantastic-especially for the amount of food you receive! I ordered a large chicken fried rice and the sesame chicken combo. 

I truly wasn't impressed with either. Not that they're awful-just lacking in flavor. The chicken fried rice has little bits of onion and chives mixed in with it which was fantastic. I was quite disappointed in the sesame chicken. There's really no flavor to it. Not crisp. It's truly nothing special and I wouldn't order it again. 

Reading other reviews, maybe I just caught them on an off night?!

Overall, the customer service outshines the food itself."
Asian House,chicken with chinese vegetables,Better than average. Your average Chinese takeout place but I've noticed their quality to be better than most places. Their General Tso's chicken is hot and crispy and boneless ribs are the most tender out of all takeout places I've been to. Service has always been really friendly and they don't skimp out when you ask them for your meal to be extra spicy. I'll always order here when I'm in the mood for cheap Chinese takeout.

Asian House,chicken with chinese vegetables,"I have a love/hate relationship with Asian House. One meal is great and the next is ""meh"". It really does disappoint me that I cannot give this a solid 4-star review, because on it's best days I feel like it really deserves it. 

For example:

The steamed dumplings are fantastic. Except when they overcook them and they are falling apart and the sauce is not put in the bag. 

The crab rangoons are great! Except when they forget to send them with.

The sesame chicken is the best I have had in the area. Except when it is cooked poorly and has a really funny aftertaste. Same with the General's chicken.

See what I mean? Just very inconsistent.

I still order from them on a regular basis. They are very friendly, the service is good in the store, and delivery is prompt. I just wish the quality control were up to par."

I read a lot of IHOP hate in the reviews.  Based on my numerous visits for a fast, cheap and calorie-laden breakfast, I respectfully disagree.  

The service is solid.  I never had to wait long to get seated and waitresses (not being sexist, just never had a waiter there) have always made their first visit within 2-3 minutes regardless of how busy the restaurant is (it's usually pretty busy).

Breakfast is always great.  I would NEVER consider going to IHOP for any meal that did not involve eggs and/or pancakes.  It just doesn't make any sense. 

They have a wide variety of omelets.  Since I am taking an egg beater to my calorie counter, I go for the Colorado Omelet. It is loaded with bacon, sausage, shredded beef, ham, onions and green peppers and cheddar.  For reasons unknown to me, I checked the nutritional information... YIKES

*Segue Alert*

The pancakes... YES!

I've had the following:
- Buttermilk
- Chocolate Chip
- Red Velvet
- Cinn-A-Stack
- Pumpkin Spice (seasonal)

Yesterday was my 1st pumpkin spice adventure.  I was concerned that the pancake would be overwhelmed with ""pumpkin spice"" and it would taste like potpourri was dumped into the pancake batter.  It was not the case at all.  IHOP did it perfectly.  There was a pumpkin flavor and the spice was subtle and incredibly flavorful with the spiced whipped cream and a syrup.  It was my favorite pancake I had there.  Even though I was completely stuffed after the omelet, I HAD to completely stuff down the rest of the pumpkin deliciousness! 

My other experiences with their pancakes were nearly as good except for red velvet and Cinn-A-Stack.  The red velvet was okay, but it was a little drier and less conducive to syrup because of the cocoa in the batter.  The 1st bite of a Cinn-A-Stack is amazing with the whip cream, cream cheese icing and cinnamon roll filling, but it is TOO d%^& sweet and heavy after more than a couple bites -- it's so heavy and sweet it gets nauseating very quickly.

With all that aside, enjoy IHOP and appreciate it for what it is... a semi-busy budget breakfast chain with fun and delicious pancakes plus good omelets. The service and consistency of this location is better than most IHOP locations I've dined."
IHOP,pancake platter,"Took over 8 mins for server to come greet us. Not even 75% of tables full. My fiancé ordered the pancake platter, and I ordered bacon wrapped sirloin ($7 special) and some crepes. After a modest wait, the crepes came to the table, and the lady that delivered them (different from server) asked if we wanted another plate, or if my fiancé was going to have anything. I felt so embarrassed by that. I'm a pretty big guy, and when she looked at me when she said that, she looked disgusted. Apparently this happened because our server put this on a separate ticket, and not with our meals.

So, when our meals came out soon after, we breathed a sigh of relief because I was worried that my fiancé's brunch was not coming. So, we dug in, and started eating. The eggs were not over medium... they were over easy... My sirloin steaks were ordered to be medium rare, and came well done. One was actually cooked so long it was dry. I told our server, and she replied ""ok, I'll let them know"" and walked away to another table. I then stopped a manager, told him about it, and he said they could take them back and cook new ones. I said ""great! and please bring my fiancé some butter for her pancakes"".

Well, second try on the medium rare steaks came... one was well done, and the other was just over medium well. Also, the butter I had asked for was no where to be seen. So I just decided to choke them down. Not to mention, while my drink glass was empty, several people came by our table to deliver food, or to check on us, and not one asked if I'd like a refill.

Yeah, this place is an IHOP. You're not going there to expect fine dining... but if you want Sunday Brunch, they better be able to deliver it! The IHOP in Wausau, WI would run circles around these people. We went to the location in Wausau many times with not one mistake, nor any type of bad service.

IHOP,bacon and eggs breakfast,"It is what it is-- sorta like a Dennys but centered on pancakes!  Went with my kid and his friend after Crazylegs on a late Saturday morning and of course it fit the bill for them.  Not very busy, friendly service (both our waitress and the manager).  Mediocre coffee but they stick a whole pot on the table so you're good to go.  Had some whole grain w/ nuts pancakes that were pretty good.  Not sure when my scrambled eggs were cooked though or if they were just waaay overcooked.  But since it was after an 8k I ate them, so I guess they weren't that bad.

If you're looking for a quick, easy, and relatively cheap place to take the kids for breakfast you can't go wrong.  Not sure why you would go here for anything else."

IHOP,bacon and eggs breakfast,"It's IHOP - I have eaten once at this location but have ordered take out  for breakfast many times.  Breakfast is breakfast not bad if you don't want to cook.  Take out orders are packed in nice take out trays.

Today I picked up dinner. Ordered basic cheeseburger with fries for my sweetie and I had the BLT with onion rings.Side of loaded baked potato soup Here's our take:

I live on the Isthmus so I had a hot/cold bag to keep the dishes warm. Worked - plates arrived warm/hot.  Cheeseburger wasn't bad, fries average. BLT wasn't too bad, onion rings were really good .  Bakes potato soup - blah! yuk! will never order that again.

Service - hostess was nice as always. I phoned in the order.  Was told it would take about 10 minutes, waited 15/20 with I got there.  Will be taking this location into consideration if I pick up breakfast of dinner again."
IHOP,bacon and eggs breakfast,"Horrible, horrible service, at a time that wasn't even that busy. Stood at the hostess stand for several minutes before being greeted or seated. Took 10+ minutes after sitting down with our menus before someone asked if we had been helped yet, at which point we ordered two coffees. Our waitress finally came around a few minutes later asking what we wanted to drink, so we told her we had already asked for some coffee. She only brought back one cup. When I asked her if I could please have one as well, she argued with me that I didn't order it. Really? On top of that, it took over 40 minutes to get our food - eggs and pancakes - and we were surrounded by empty tables. Will not return."
IHOP,bacon and eggs breakfast,"This IHOP location is convenient to the near West side of campus.  Between the University Hospital and  Hilldale Mall.  Weekend mornings,  this place is busy!  There are extra parking spots on the other side of restaurant or park on Ridge and walk over.

I usually go on a week day morning because it's quieter.  I have had good service when I'm noticed.  There has been a time or two that I've had to shout to the back kitchen that I was there.  But the coffee comes quickly and the food shortly after that.

Food wise, it's like an IHOP anywhere.  Order a breakfast and get pancakes, or go lighter.  They have something for anyone.  Sometimes they run out of bananas, which can be a bummer.

If you are looking for an impressive brunch, you know this isn't the place.  But looking for a good breakfast that is cost effective, come on it."

Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"I am relatively inexperienced with Indian food, and as someone who is very picky with food I am unfamiliar with, my experience here was pleasant. Service was quick and we were seated promptly. My SO and I came on a quiet afternoon after he stated he was craving some Indian food. There were only about 3 other people in the restaurant so it was pretty quiet. I had no clue what the chutney was for, and I didn't like the aftertaste of papadum (just in general), so I just waited for my order for the tikka masala and mango lassi. The naan and my mango lassi came first, the latter being very delicious. I don't like the taste of naan, but their tikka masala and the rice were excellent. The chicken was tender and I couldn't get enough. So as far as service and the quality of the food I ordered, I was very satisfied!"
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"The place is quite nice in appearance and seemed very clean.  The food was hot and the buffet was kept stocked nicely.  The food wasn't bad but wasn't that good either.

When I think of Indian food, I want a depth of flavor, some intensity.  The food here was none of that.  It was even somewhat bland.  The chicken masala had nice chunks of white breast meat, but there was hardly any spice in it.  Seemed like Midwestern chicken gravy.  And the beef curry was just as flavorless.

The nana bread was good as was the rice Brian's.  but that was about it."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  I would give ten stars if I could and signed up for a yelp account just so I could share my awesome find with others.  Hands down some of the best Indian food I've ever had . . . and I lived in India.  Great, friendly and fast service in a cozy atmosphere.  I've been for dine in dinner and take out and have never been disappointed.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable - I highly recommend the combination dinners - they have a vegetarian or meat combo that includes three curry-type dishes, nan, rice, pakora appetizer and dessert for under $14!

The chicken tikka masala is incredible - like everything else.  They give you generous portions (enough for at least another whole meal at home, YUM).  The only draw back is that the are a little off the beaten path on S. Park but well worth the extra five or ten minutes out of your way."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"I went to Taj on friday driving all the way from middleton to way with my friends who work at UW. When i stepped inside the restaurant I can barely see any customers, we went for the buffet and it was horrible. All the dishes seems to be horrible they didn't look fresh at all. Only thing I liked is samosa which seems to be freshly made. I went to Dhaba, Minerva and swagat on west side and Taj seems to the worst of all. I will never goto this place and wouldn't recommend to my friends.

Stay away from this restaurant."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"We recieved superb service and memorable food here. Rice, papadum, and a chutney assortment were all included with our meal, which I don't recall always being the case at local Indian restaurants. We will certainly return."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"I went here because of good reviews, but the food is recycled, it was bearly warm, so I would say it was the buffet leftovers. Because of that I would have expected athe portions to be more generous at least to justify the 12.00 a plate and 2.50 for naan, I tell you they are very stingy even w white rice. Thats probably why only three tables were filled on a Friday night, I thought these people were buisness smart, DONT THEY KNOW AMERICANS LOVE BIG PORTIONS, they eat big portions, but I guess some people are stingy and their wallet is more important."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"I found this place on the AA Dining Advantage website. I was the only diner on a Sunday evening, although several people came in for take out. The mild lamb shish kebab was spicy in a delicious way; there was enough for two servings. I also got a fresh side salad; nothing fancy. Service was adequate. Prices are fair."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"I want to give it five stars.  I went here easily 25+ times over the past three years.  I've been here for both the all you can eat lunch and dinner (dine in and dine out).  I really like the people who own and run the restaurant, and I would love to see them keep dishing out food for years to come. 

But despite my loyalty, I just can't go above three stars.  First of all, it is pretty pricey.  $11.95 and up for entrees, and an extra $2.50 for the almost obligatory naan ($1.95 for plain).  Granted, it's a lot of food- you get a big serving of rice along with a large, generous portion of meat and curry.  But it's madison....I can eat at some places very close for under $6.

Second, I know it's recycled lunch items on me for dinner take out.  It's not hard to tell.  Dried out, reheated naan just doesn't taste like it does when it's piping hot out of the tandoori oven.  I'm pretty sure i've had reheated lunch servings of curry as well.  It didn't happen every time, but it happened enough that I decreased my visits.

Lunch is probably better than dinner, with a big selection to choose from, and all of the food is good.  I'd definitely recommend it for lunch.

I feel like the chef needs to go on ""kitchen nightmares.""  The food is great, but It just seems like somewhere along the grind of maintaining a restaurant the owners/chefs lost their passion.  Gordon ramsey, make them whole again.  Then maybe I can come back and update my posts after I get some fresh cooked food at a reasonable price."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"First to arrive for the lunch buffet, so the food din't sit for long. Literally had one of everything (I shouldn't be allowed at buffets), so I got a good sense of what they had to offer. 

the good
- pakora: the vegetable (cauliflower) was better than the fish or chicken, crispy & well-seasoned
- saag paneer: creamy, thick & rich, but not excessively so
- kofta: nice soft texture, good flavor, well sauced
- gulab jamun: not offensively sweet, good texture
- kheer: same as above

the just okay
- samosas, garlic naan, basmati rice were fine but unremarkable
- watery dishes: chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, dal, raita (would have been much better if the sauce had the consistency of the saag paneer)

the wtf?
- beef at an indian restaurant?! 
- no lamb
- no spice/heat
- bathrooms are kinda retro but not scary

I recently just got back from a trip to India (Jaipur, Rajasthan) and the dishes listed under 'good' above were comparable. At less than $10, it was a great deal and will be back."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"Awful... simply awful.  I love Indian food, and while visiting Madison, I thought I hit the jackpot because I found some that delivered.  How sad was !!!!

Naan bread is one primary method to evaluate any legit place.  Theirs is tasteless.  I could have saved myself the money and got myself some wonder bread.

Tasteless also sums up the rice.  Anyone who goes Indian knows that the rice is very distinctive.  Sadly, this was also not to be.  Another money saving tip would have been to buy some instant Uncle Bens.

The rest of the food followed along similar lines.  My recommendation is to do without at your hotel room."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"Admittedly, I've never had the lunch buffet; as for the dinner menu, though? Delicious! The Boy and I eat there at least once a week, often twice. We go through withdrawals if we're away too long!

Since we're both veg*n, I can only attest to the Vegetarian offerings, but between the two of us, I think we've had everything in the Veg section, and we've never had a bad meal here. Every plate has the option of mild/medium/spicy, and extra rice is always available free (even when you take half of the food home, as I usually have to do). The portions are perfect in that, if you're like him, it's a perfect stomach-stuffer -  and if you're like me, I always have leftovers for the next day! 

Particularly good dishes are the Baingan Bhartha, Vegetable Mango, and Bhindi Masala (The cheese-eating Boy swears by the Saag Mushroom and Paneer Jalfrazie). The Samosas are wonderful, and the onion chutney is always amazing. Be sure to add a Taj Mahal beer for the perfect meal. :)

The prices are great (two meals, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks comes to less than $30 before tipping).

Taj is an all-around great establishment with a great family-owned feel that's friendly without being overbearing."
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,BEST INDIAN FOOD IN MADISON. I seriously went to almost every one in town. Best rice and best sauces and highest quality meat I have found yet. A+++ Taj! Thank You! :D
Taj Indian Restaurant,side of rice,"I got Taj delivered to my apartment last night as I didn't feel like venturing out to a restaurant. It was super fast and arrived piping hot, I was very impressed!

I got the Matter Paneer and it was the best I have ever had. Super flavorful. The rice is also delicious as was the naan. I got an order of plain naan this time but would try a new flavor next time. 

One thing I would note for next time is that the dinner options come with a side of rice. I didn't realize this as most places I have been to everything comes a la carte. So I ordered an extra order of rice but like I said it is delicious so I'm not complaining!"
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"LOVE THIS PLACE!  I would give ten stars if I could and signed up for a yelp account just so I could share my awesome find with others.  Hands down some of the best Indian food I've ever had . . . and I lived in India.  Great, friendly and fast service in a cozy atmosphere.  I've been for dine in dinner and take out and have never been disappointed.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable - I highly recommend the combination dinners - they have a vegetarian or meat combo that includes three curry-type dishes, nan, rice, pakora appetizer and dessert for under $14!

The chicken tikka masala is incredible - like everything else.  They give you generous portions (enough for at least another whole meal at home, YUM).  The only draw back is that the are a little off the beaten path on S. Park but well worth the extra five or ten minutes out of your way."
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"Taj serves up the best Indian dinner in all of Madison. I have been on several occasions and have always enjoyed all aspects of my night out. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small but very well lit and cheery. There have been several other groups dining during my visits, but I have never had to wait for a table. The staff is always attentive but never in the way. 

The complimentary poppadom with three chutneys is a great way to start the meal off. All three chutneys are very flavorful and completely different from one another. The chai is wonderful; I'm pretty sure it's made with cream. Great naan too. For the main course, my favorite is the vegetable korma. It's the perfect combination of creamy and spicy. I am a little skeptical that the vegetables were frozen minutes before the reached my plate, but who's to care if it still tastes like heaven on earth? The saag paneer was also very good. 

I have yet to try Taj's lunch buffet, but if the food is anything like it is for dinner, I'm pretty sure I won't be disappointed."
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"Firstly, I should say -- this place does have delivery. In fact, more and more restaurants are offering a 3rd party delivery service called StraightToYourDoor.com . They are one such place at the moment. I have gone here a few times, dinner and lunch. The dinner experience I found slightly slow, even though nobody is there. Maybe its based on the way they prepare food or something but it feels like you wait forever. Even with an appetizer, I still waited a while after finishing it for my main course. Lunch is where it is at. For $7.95, they have a lunch buffet that includes naan. If you wanted to be el-cheapo, if you forgo a drink, that is under $10. I believe with a drink, it goes slightly over. But still, that is cheap for a lunch. It's a great way to introduce others to Indian food or give yourself an opportunity to explore other things you might not otherwise order for dinner. I find the wait staff very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant."
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,I ordered delivery when I was in town and got the vegetarian combo dinner. The delivery was fast and everything was delicious! I will definitely order from here again next time I'm in town.
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"Wow!  This place is a great pick for that night time date, family get together or just some place great last minute.  The buffet of course is the best but the evening menu is delicious.  I had a spicy lamb dish and my daughter had an amazing crab crepe!  Over the top good.  Lovely and elegant place but modestly priced.  No other place to go for lunch or dinner!  A Must!!!!!!!!"
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"I have eaten here about 10 times and gotten take-out maybe another 7-10.  GREAT Indian food, excellent service, and a nice setting.  You know those places that have stuff hanging off the ceiling but it is greasy and has cobwebs?  Well this isn't it...Taj os bright and cheerful and c-l-e-a-n.  The vegetarian and ""meatatarian"" specials are both good (ask to upgrade the basic naan for a small upcharge to garlic or ginger).  The Indian wine, which I had never had before going here, was impressive.  Lighter fruits and various floral flavors blend beautifully and pair nicely with the dishes, and the wine is very reasonably priced.  Oh, and the only tandoori I have ever had that is moist - too many are dired out.
Overall a wonderful value, and nice enough you could make it a special event dinner."
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"I want to give it five stars.  I went here easily 25+ times over the past three years.  I've been here for both the all you can eat lunch and dinner (dine in and dine out).  I really like the people who own and run the restaurant, and I would love to see them keep dishing out food for years to come. 

But despite my loyalty, I just can't go above three stars.  First of all, it is pretty pricey.  $11.95 and up for entrees, and an extra $2.50 for the almost obligatory naan ($1.95 for plain).  Granted, it's a lot of food- you get a big serving of rice along with a large, generous portion of meat and curry.  But it's madison....I can eat at some places very close for under $6.

Second, I know it's recycled lunch items on me for dinner take out.  It's not hard to tell.  Dried out, reheated naan just doesn't taste like it does when it's piping hot out of the tandoori oven.  I'm pretty sure i've had reheated lunch servings of curry as well.  It didn't happen every time, but it happened enough that I decreased my visits.

Lunch is probably better than dinner, with a big selection to choose from, and all of the food is good.  I'd definitely recommend it for lunch.

I feel like the chef needs to go on ""kitchen nightmares.""  The food is great, but It just seems like somewhere along the grind of maintaining a restaurant the owners/chefs lost their passion.  Gordon ramsey, make them whole again.  Then maybe I can come back and update my posts after I get some fresh cooked food at a reasonable price."
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"I always get the chicken tikka masala and it's always delicious.  The staff is pleasant and I haven't had a bad experience.  The price is a bit steep, but it's worth it for the occasional dinner splurge."
Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"Admittedly, I've never had the lunch buffet; as for the dinner menu, though? Delicious! The Boy and I eat there at least once a week, often twice. We go through withdrawals if we're away too long!

Since we're both veg*n, I can only attest to the Vegetarian offerings, but between the two of us, I think we've had everything in the Veg section, and we've never had a bad meal here. Every plate has the option of mild/medium/spicy, and extra rice is always available free (even when you take half of the food home, as I usually have to do). The portions are perfect in that, if you're like him, it's a perfect stomach-stuffer -  and if you're like me, I always have leftovers for the next day! 

Particularly good dishes are the Baingan Bhartha, Vegetable Mango, and Bhindi Masala (The cheese-eating Boy swears by the Saag Mushroom and Paneer Jalfrazie). The Samosas are wonderful, and the onion chutney is always amazing. Be sure to add a Taj Mahal beer for the perfect meal. :)

The prices are great (two meals, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks comes to less than $30 before tipping). The service is always prompt and friendly, and while the atmosphere is casual (we often venture in in hoodies and jeans), you could easily make it a nice date outing (the lighting is soft and the decor nice enough).

Taj Indian Restaurant,non-vegetarian combo dinner,"I went here with two friends on a not-so-busy Saturday night for dinner. While the food was delicious (I had paneer cheese in tomato-butter sauce and LOVED it), the portion sizes were really good (I was able to finish it all but did not want any more), and the waitstaff was pleasant, service was slow even though there were not very many people there, and I can't help but feel slightly awkward when they keep coming back every couple of minutes to fill your glass of water (but that kind of happens a lot at Indian restaurants). It was pleasant enough, but for the combination of the atmosphere, how much it cost, and how long it took, I don't think I will be back any time soon, at least for dinner. I may try it again for lunch sometime if I'm anywhere near home in the middle of the day."

The price is on the lower end of average which helps make up for it and I haven't ever had anything BAD here at all but I've had some unfortunately fatty pieces of meat that did mar what would have been an otherwise good dish.

I definitely get the impression that their lunch buffet is just ""going through the motions"" -- perhaps their dinner service is better? 

That being said I'll speak for the lunch buffet only -- unless you're only going because it is in walking distance for lunch -- you've got other options that will deliver better selection and better taste."

Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I had extremely high hopes for this place and was let down. The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the extra $2 charge for the meatballs seems over-the-top. I ordered the Cheef sandwich and my Dad ordered the Philly Cheesesteak but based on our experience they are the exact same sandwich. The Cheef says it comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers...when I asked for both I got charged 49 cents twice for the peppers. The menu says nothing about an extra charge for these items but says you can add them to other sandwiches for a charge. In my experience when it says ""comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers"" you shouldn't have to pay extra for those peppers. Both of the sandwiches were alright though they came with an ample amount of fillings. Both of the sandwiches came with beef and although there was plenty of the beef it was basically flavorless. The only flavor mine had was from the $1 worth of peppers. The desserts were also very disappointing. The picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade. The tiramisu we got was a frozen, pre-packaged triangle that didn't have much flavor. The two cannolis we got were also pre-packaged and frozen but actually had really good flavor. All-in-all I'm pretty disappointed.

I would consider going back to try the Chicago style hot dogs and their pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Food is always great.  Give a little love to the waitstaff, though.  On one night, I was worried for the girl who took my order.  She made a mistake and I got the impression that mgmt. would not be pleased with her if she did the right thing by the customer.  She should have been able, at the very least (in my opinion) to give me 50% discount on the pizza only, if the error resulted in wasting half the pizza.  I didn't argue with the meager offer of 25%.  I remembered my niece's experiences while working there at one point and immediately related to the anxiety the staff was experiencing.  If you can tell the mgmt. when their staff is great, maybe this will help them forge better relations with their employees.  Obviously, if they enable their staff to give superior service, they will win more than loyal customers, they will gain happy and confident employees.  If I were the type of customer that demanded fairness and could not see the fear of the boss in this employee, things would have escalated and that would have been silly.  Silly because in a lot of restaurants they would simply buy the loyal customer the entire pizza!  Again, great food!!  I will make sure I do my part in the future and repeat my order a couple times to help out the busy and helpful staff."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I've been ordering from Rosati's West since I moved to Madison. However, since they raised their prices, I don't feel like their meals are competitive anymore -- there's a lot of good other pizza joints around here. Also, their ""customer service"" is kinda crappy. Obviously, small mistakes happen - and they have multiple times before - (e.g. being charged for mayos that should have been included) but I never thought of writing a review up until tonight. 

So, amongst other things, I ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds. Both came plain, with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Cheese curds also came with no sauce. I was not asked what I wanted with curds/ on sandwiches during the order and I definitely did not say that I wanted them plain, as witnessed by two other people in the room while I placed the order. When I called back, the kid told me that I ordered plain & cheese curds with no sauce. You know, if I don't explicitly say that you want lettuce, tomato and mayo, but your menu says that it comes with it, you just put in on it, period. Kid said (with an attitude) that he will put in a note for the next time... there will be no next time! It's not like I wanted my money back... all they needed to say was sorry, it's not going to happen again."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,We had the dough nuggets and a deep dish pizza. Both were delicious. Staff was friendly.
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Worst pizza ever. They have no idea how to make a pizza.
They advertise ""Chicago Style"" , they don't have any idea what that is.
The only reason I am giving it one star is because there isn't a negative star !!!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Rosati's gets two stars this time but it could get three or four. The potential is there and if you're going to have pizza in this strip mall, I'd choose the dark, dingy Rosati's over the more wide open, brighter Dahmen's every single time.

On our last visit, it was a Saturday around lunchtime and the place was surprisingly busy. The waitress had her hands full, but she held her own. My son and I each ordered a slice of pizza. Mine was served at room temperature. There goes one star. Make it two. The crust on their Chicago-style pizza is chewier, in an overcooked or not-very-fresh sort of way, and less flavorful than others in Chicago, and Madison for that matter. There goes another star. Make a wish. Mine is for a fresher slice of pizza. In past visits, we've had the thin crust. I think Rosati's does this much better.

My daughter had mostaccioli with sauce and butter on the side. Anyone can do that, so I'm not going to rate the entree, but I will say the marinara is fresh, thick and well-seasoned. The cheesy garlic bread is a guilty pleasure and a must-order every time, especially when dipped in that marinara. We've had the Friday fish fry. Skip it, but that's on us for ordering a fish fry at a pizza joint. 

We go to Rosati's fairly frequently and will be back. I think the solution to making this place awesome might be a just a little more attention to quality control."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I have mostly had a good experience here. I prefer the thin crust over the deep dish (a sin being this close to Chicago). Their other food besides pizza is excellent, from fish sandwiches to pasta to burgers."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. I ordered a large pepperoni and a medium vegetarian pizza and two small salads and it cost me over $50. The pizza were to be delivered within 45 minutes to an hour and it took an hour and 30 minutes. I opened the boxes to find the thinnest crust I have ever seen on a pizza and they were supposed to be Chicago style. I am not kidding if they were  1/4 inch deep that would be stretching it. There were no identifiable toppings on the pizza except for two pepperoni. Nothing on the vegetarian pizza.
I called to speak with the manager and he was quite rude. I've told me that he was not the one that ordered the pizzas and I could probably get a better pizza in the grocery store. He also asked me to not post a negative review because it would hurt his four children.
I would not recommend this pizza place."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Picked up 2 Chicago Deep Dish pizzas for lunch after a night on the town. 1 pizza was veggies, the other sausage, hot peppers, and mushrooms. Basically the taste of cheese dominated these pizzas with a seldom taste of topping -- a cheese bomb."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"This pizza is good to get if you have a big group and you don't want to spend too much money on a more high end pizza. 
The pizza has a thin crust, but the crust isn't delicious, which is disappointing, since I love the crusts of pizzas. The flavors are mediocre, and I've never ordered this pizza myself before."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Dined inside Rosati's for the first time on a Sunday night. I dined alone that night but craved pizza, so I opted for a calzone so I did not over-order. The mozzarella was deliciously gooey. The sausage stood out. I also ordered the calzone with fresh garlic and red onion which gave it a great balance.

My only regret about this visit is that I didn't get a deep dish pizza instead -- I get the impression that if their toppings are this great, their deep dish probably won't disappoint. Will be coming back again when I get a chance. Maybe with friends this time!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Well, I guess I have to up this review to four stars since I can't get enough of Rosati's Italian beef.  I have absolutely no idea how authentic it is, but since Rosati's is a Chicago-based chain, I'm guessing it's pretty close to the real deal.  Anyway, it's delicious, and the portions are extremely generous for what you pay (although the delivery charge still sucks).  

Also, thin crust pizza is the way to go here.  It's still pretty greasy, but not as bad as the thicker crusts.  The individual-size pizza is pretty big for just one person and at a good price."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"The lighting is subdued, the decor quaint, and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. I liked the hand-painted wall murals and the Rosati's Italian sauce cans that bordered the ceiling. Adele music filled the small restaurant that has just six booths and three tables. It was very pleasant. Rosati's was busy the entire time we were there - there were always one or two groups waiting to be seated. Our server (Lindsey) was spectacular. We ordered a medium Chicago style pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onion, mushroom and black olive. It was much too much pizza - they are very generous with the toppings. The pizza was very good. The prices were reasonable. It is a great place for a couple or a small group (4-5) to enjoy a pizza/pasta night."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"There is no doubt that this is the only TRUE pizza in Madison...Those who run with the masses and order the sugary cheap chain pizzas have no clue as to what they are missing.  Treat yourselves someday to the crispy THIN PIZZA with Non-sugary sauce, perfectly spiced, with GENEROUS toppings and tons of melty cheese...ALWAYS delivered HOT.....MELTY....PERFECT..even in single digit temps...Rosati's Sausage is incredible BTW...their own recipe ....I insist you try the Chicago STYLE also some night ...It is BEYOND wonderful and balanced in flavors and textures...from the buttery flakey crust to the rich tomatoey sauce and the generous fillings not to mention the ooooozey cheeses..Check the menu for other items also ..like if you crave (or never even tried) a REAL Chicago Beef...THIS is the place..I get mine"" wet, no cheese, hot Giardiniera"" ...it is AMAZING  and HUGE!!
Ok  well enough bragging about my favorite Madison Place for Take out...but..Trust me  you will NOT be disappointed...i would never lie to you"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"This place is phenomenal. Whenever we want pizza, this is the place we want to get it from, even if fast food pizza is cheaper. Great Chicago style pizza, in the opinion of this former Chicago native."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,Ordered Rosati's for the first time last night.... YUM!! Delivery was faster than expected. Cheese pizza was simple but very tasty. Also got little bite-sized desserts that came with Nutella... heaven!! Will definitely order again :)
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Life's too short to eat mediocre pizza.  That pretty much sums up my feelings about Rosati's.  Stranded on the west side and in need of lunch, the WaunaQueen and I decided to give Rosati's a shot.  She ordered a slice of the pepperoni, I opted the Cheef sandwich, Italian Beef with covered with melted mozzarella cheese.

Both offerings were exceptionally mediocre.  The crust reminded me of what you get with a frozen pizza, dense, overly chewy and flavorless.  The sauce had that overcooked, right out of a can flavor.  The greasy cheese and pepperoni followed the exceedingly mediocre theme to a T.  To make matters worse, my wife's slice came out warm at best, so she had to have the kitchen put it in the oven to warm it up. 

The Italian Beef sandwich had little going for it in the flavor department, whether it be the spongy bread, the melted slab of chewy mozzarella cheese or the watery ju that accompanied the sandwich.  I appreciated the generous serving of beef, but man oh man, I'd trade less beef for more flavor.  The crinkle-cut fries came out warm and limp.

Service at the front counter was pleasant and efficient.  The person at the counter cheerfully greeted us as we entered the restaurant and granted our request for a side of feta cheese to go with my daughter slice of cheese pizza.  With a variety of lunch specials, you do not need to spend a fortune on your lunch here.  

The dining room could serve as a set for Goodfellas, with the Italian music wafting over the speakers, the red and white checked (plastic) tablecloths, elevated private booths and a minimal amount of sunlight filtering in though a small window.    The two big screens TVs detracted from the ambiance, but I did appreciate being able check the score of the World Cup match taking place that day.

If you are looking for cheap and filling, this is your place.  If you are looking for delicious, keep driving past this strip mall outpost."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,The pan style pizza was perfect with a non dry cluster! Service was good with a typical family style setting with checkered table clothes. The gyro pizza was excellent.
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,I received a coupon in the mail for a free pizza and they wouldn't honor it. I'd be more upset if they were better than second rate.
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Pizza was pretty good, considering it was delivered.
Sauce is well-balanced and not sweet (a huge plus!).
Cheese seemed to be of high quality.
The thicker crust was not to my personal preference (the in-between of the thin and deepdish).  I did like the thin crust.
I'd definitely order again."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"This place was pretty good. Perhaps the better pizza outside of downtown. We ordered a gyro pizza on the thin crust which was really quite good. They make a yummy pizza.

On the downside, the ceaser salad was a few torn pieces of romaine, shred of parmesan, and a vinegar based ceaser dressing. Not good. No effort to actually make it a dish worth eating. For comparison Lou Malnatis makes an excellent ceaser salad. Also, free breadsticks with the pizza for the monday special were alright. Better than the salad but not worth buying if they ain't free although the marinara sauce tasted pretty good. A simple tomatoey marinara.

So I would come again but avoid the side dishes and stick to the main events."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I've had Rosati's in Chicago and always thought they were a decent pizza, certainly not top 10, but good for a change of pace from the typical places.

I stopped by this location since it was near my hotel and I learned they also served Italian Beef sammies, which are hard to find outside the Chicago area -- so they were getting my business after a 12 hour, no lunch work day.

Since I had to get an Italian Beef, I also got a thin crust personal pizza (it was my first meal all day, don't judge me!) , in hopes that their thin crust was better than my memories of their deep dish back in Chicago.

Unfortunately, while the Italian Beef was much better than expected, the Pizza was not. It wasn't bad, it was just bland and reminded me much like a kit pizza you would get at a bowling alley."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Excellent pizza. I use dot eat here quite a bit. It is more expensive, but you get what you pay for. The other menu items have always been very good also. Definitely would recommend."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Chicago style pizza! Yes! It had to be authentic Chicago style, since I don't believe I had it ever. Only thing I ever that was remotely close was Bostonized, but that ain't Chicago - at least where I live. Used to the normal chains of Dominos, Pizza Hut, and the rest of them, but coming to a Chicago style pie joint is possibility made in heaven, I gotta say. After getting my pint of chocolate ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery relatively nearby, my Fitchburg friends and I stopped here at Rosati's for a delicious pie that could not be beat.

Located on Mineral Pointe Road in the heart of Fitchburg, there is no shortage of parking spaces here, unless you have come on prime time and need a space. Rosati's is within the Clock Tower shopping complex on Mineral Pointe road, nearby the Saigon Noodles I had been to the night before on Odana Road. Plenty of food choices out here. With that in mind, my friend and I ordered take out instead of dining in, so this review is just for the counter service and the food items we bought. I had ordered the 14"" Rosati Monster with the double stuffed crust, along with a side order of mozzarella sticks.

Let me tell you that I had thought about getting the 16"", but when that 14"" came out, that monster was crazy huge! And I thought I could have tanked a medium Pizza Hut pizza without any problems. I guess they don't call it the Rosati Monster for nothing! The pizza itself was a meaty cheesy monstrosity that could not be tamed in one sitting. I tried my best, but I could just manage half of it while saving myself for Cold Stone, which I took out 1/4 of it along with the mozzarella sticks before calling it a night. Guess ill be having the rest of it for breakfast and lunch sometime. The pizza itself was rather good and heavy, so that was a feast in itself. I really did enjoy myself with this pizza and hope to do it again soon. The mix of meaty and cheesy was so good, I guess that mixture is total bliss. And it was!

The counter service was ok at best. Everyone was moving around like it was crazy busy that night, but whatever works to get everyone's orders straight and make everyone happy and satisfied. They take credit cards, so that always awesome. That made me happy. They also have a dining area / restaurant, so that's nifty, if you choose to dine in here one of these days. Glad we phoned our order in, otherwise, we would have been waiting quite a long time for our order. Glad we made a pitstop at Cold Stone first before coming here. Overall, this plus is a serious recommend for sure. If you enjoy Chicago deep dish and Authentic made, this place is the one to go to. Just 3 hour drive northwest of Chicago, its pretty much the closest to the heart of Chicago if you are craving something from the source, but not willing to drive to the source. Rosati's is your best bet ever!

Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"We only ever get carry-out from Rosati's, but it's always fast and delicious.  Both the pizza and the lasagna keep us coming back.  That being said, the crust is a little on the chewy side and the salads are very plain.  The service is average, everyone usually looks like they're in a big hurry but they always get our order to us without much fuss.  We give them steady business and have not yet had a bad experience."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"If you need a Chicago food fix, come here.  The Italian beefs are solid and so is the chicken parm.  Pizza is so-so."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I lived in or near Chicago for most of my life, and have frequented some of the best Chicago pizza restaurants in the Chicago area, including the original Pizzeria Uno (and Due), Lou Matti's and other more local favorites.  I used to deliver for a Rosati's franchise in the Chicago suburbs, and came to appreciate the finer points of this food genre while working there.

This Rosati's franchise is not the best I've seen, but it has improved greatly since I placed my first order there 4 years ago.  The variety of crust/pan choices is something that's unique to Rosati's.  The double dough and the ""Chicago style"" pan are my favorites.  Unlike some other local pizza places, they put the sauce all over the crust, and don't skimp on toppings.  Other favorites are the baked lasagna and chicken sandwich.

I'm a 100% delivery customer, and the drivers who bring my orders are great guys.  I tip them well and they never let me down.

Pluses: the variety of food choices for a pizza place:

Minuses: They close too early for my hours."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"We tried the Chicago style pizza and hot buffalo wings. Both were good, but neither was particularly noteworthy. The pizza had a very thick and somewhat doughy crust and a good amount of cheese and toppings. The sauce is a little on the bland side and the two pizzas I ordered both failed to travel particularly well even though it wasn't a terribly long drive home. The first small pizza was sausage and pepperoni and it was probably the better of the two. The sausage was somewhat on the bland side with very little in the way of savory or spicy flavor. That being said, the texture of the sausage was really good and the amount on the pizza was generous. The pepperoni was also pretty good, but not being on top of the pie during cooking means it doesn't brown up nicely and it gets a little lost. The other small pizza was veggie and it was also good, but somewhat on the bland side. The veggies give up a fair bit of liquid during cooking so this pizza did not hold together structurally as well as the other. The cheese on both was abundant but not exciting and lacked some of the amazing pull that comes on the very best pizzas. 

The wings were cooked nicely, although maybe one more minute in the fryer wouldn't have hurt. These wing are breaded then fried which makes them slightly heavier than non-breaded wings. The hot buffalo sauce was good, but again, nothing special. 

Rosati's was good pizza and I would be curious to try their thin crust options, but there are much better options in Madison and incomparably better options in Chicago. I also thought it was a little silly to be charged $0.53 for a side of hot giardinaire on a $48 order of two small pizzas and wings. Not the end of the world by any means, but still a little lackluster."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Just about as perfect as a Chicago-style pizza can get. Their sauce was excellent, and their crust is superb! Sauce on top, just like it should be, piled with loads of toppings and cheese!

Service was ok - she kept my drink filled. They only had one server though, and they got busy quickly, so she was very frantic and all over the place.

Appetizer sampler was ok, but nothing to write home about."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"This pizza place has a lot of good things going for it! My work recently catered in lunch and I was able to sample some of their thin crust pizza offerings. 

My initial thought was ""this is not thin crust"" - but when I think thin, I think cracker thin. That being said a cracker crust would never hold-up to the glorious amount of stretchy cheese and toppings that are present in every bite - so gooey! 

The establishment remains true to its claim of authentic ""Chicago"" style with hand-crafted Italian sausage present on many items. I tried the Godfather and I really like the addition of giardiniera and this was far and away my favorite specialty pizza. The sauce was good - not too sweet - and portioned out mildly enough not to over power the bite.

Overall it's good pizza and worth the extra couple of dollars for something far more substantial then your average chain!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"It would have been nice to see if they actually HAVE good pizza. I went into their dining room and waited to be seated. Two waitresses and only one table occupied.  Despite being only five feet from them, neither bothered to acknowledge me or ask if I wanted to sit down. They were too busy talking and deciding which CD to play. After waiting for a time, I walked out.  I couldn't believe how rude they were."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. 

Much of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. 

Rosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right. 

Eat up and leave your calorie counter at home ... or else it may explode."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Pizza is good. 
I order the fish for lunch sometimes. It has gotten progressively worse. 
Soggy fries and 1.5 hours delivery times. Last time I order here."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,Great food and decent service. It was the first time we tried Chicago style pizza and we loved it! However we gave it 4 stars because our pizza was lukewarm. Since they are made to order and it wasn't crowded we thought it would be hot.
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"BLEH! Do not ... NOT ... order anything but pizza for delivery, and have tons of napkins or paper towels available to sop up the grease on that. We ordered baked lasagna dinner and ribs with fries dinner tonight. Fries were sloppy floppy sticky starch sticks I wouldn't give my pups (and they love their fries!). I had about 3 bites of the overly bbq'd undercooked ribs before I stopped because I didn't want to become ill. Cooked ribs should not be gray. Apparently the lasagna was ok, he ate that. 

Last time for this place."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"The 2 hot dog combo is a great deal - Chicago-style dogs are so expensive around here, so 2 dogs, really good fries and a drink for $6 works for me.  I also tried the Italian Beef and it was just right - just like home.  Our service was excellent both times we've visitied.  I would go five stars, but this weekend my wife ordered the ""double dough"" pizza and I tried it - pretty disapointingly dry bland crust.  I'm certainly going to try the deep-dish sometime...maybe I'll change my review after that - 5star if it's great and down to 3 if it stinks."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"As a transplant from Chicago, one of the most difficult adjustments to Madison life has been the lack of quality pizza.  It boggles my mind that we are in such a vast wasteland when it comes to pizza!  And to find a dine in pizza place with decent offering is even more difficult.  I grew up on thin crust Chicago style. Rosati ' s has the best I've come across in my search for a taste of home. They use cheese that tastes like cheese., and Chicago style Italian sausage.  I do recommend ordering the thin ""double crust"" as the standard is too thin and cracker - like. 

Atmosphere is okay.  I wish I didn't have to listen to continuous Frank Sinatra every time for the entire duration of the meal.

Customer service was minimal.  I'm not one to expect the server to carry on long conversation.  But when they ask how we're enjoying the meal, it would be nice if they, at least, pretended as if they were listening /cared. 

Value is about what I expect for a dine in pizza.  Sixteen inch double crust sausage and bacon (we always get more than necessary to have leftovers.) Was about  $21.

Definitely a favorite when our stomachs are missing home. (I would give 3.5 stars of Yelp allowed.)"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"The best pizza in Madison.
Don't listen to the other reviews.
Everybody knows rosatis is the best.
Pizza,sandwiches we have had it all and its all excellent food."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Really disappointed in the regular, large, pepperoni pizza.

I live near their Mineral Point location and since I can't seem to find a decent Italian spot, much less a pizza, in Madison..... I tried Rosati's.

This is my 2nd time ordering a pizza from them.  The first time they burnt it so when we ate it all we tasted was a char taste. Well, this one wasn't burnt, but instead of tasting the burnt taste, I tasted the sauce. Which tasted like Spaghettio sauce. Not a whole lot of cheese on there. The crust was thinner than I expected as I didn't order a ""thin crust"", just regular... *shrug* 

My husband and I both had a ""WTF"" moment and said that it tasted like a Tombstone. Then I said, ""Not even a Tombstone! Maybe a Jack's frozen pizza!"" Literally had me wishing I didn't waste $16 on this.

The 2nd star comes from the Italian Beef they have there. They are really good, and huge portion for the price. Wishing I would have ordered that instead of the pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Rosati's is my favorite pizza in the Madison area.  There's something magical about the sauce, cheese, and their italian sausage (we roll simple in my household)...  Very few pizzas give me that satisfying ""hunger quenching"" feeling that Rosati's gives me.  Unfortunately, that leads to the problem of not knowing when to stop!  But that's my problem, not theirs...

I've carried out for lunch as well as ate in with the family.  I've never been disappointed!  The kids love it.  I love it.  My extended family loves it.  It's awesome.  The grab-and-go lunch options are nice too (I work nearby)."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"This is our go to pizza place when we want food delivered right to our door or my husband wants to do a quick carryout. We live a few miles down the road and we normally wait between 45 minutes to an hour for deliveries, but only around 20 minutes for carryout. 

I would say 90% of the time we get this, our food is great for a chain pizza joint. We prefer it much more over Dominos or Pizza Hut. The few times our food is sub par is usually when we order food that isn't pizza. The last couple of times, for example, we ordered jalapeño poppers as a side and when they showed up, all of the breading had fallen off inside the box. There have been other times, however, where they come perfectly fine. I think it depends on the day.

The staff have always been very friendly, but we have never actually sat down to eat inside the restaurant so I cannot comment as to the environment. It always seems clean when we are waiting in line for our carryout orders. The delivery staff is always extremely friendly. They even delivered to our specific hotel room a couple of times when my apartment had flooded and I had to move out for repairs.

Overall, if you are looking for some decent pizza at a fairly cheap price (for the Madison area), this is a good place!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I've been here before, and again, it has surpassed my expectations and has always delivered (no pun intended).  I usually only get delivery and that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour, but it's worth the wait.  This time I ordered a stuffed crust pizza - I was expecting more of a sandwich/calzone stuffed pizza, but they basically have cheese and toppings between two layers of crust and then the sauce on the top.  Still pretty delicious, but a lot like Chicago for me, which is not a bad thing. 

Also, I ordered a small batch of wings (spicy garlic) and they were delicious.  It is hard to find good wings from restaurants that don't feature them, but they did a great job!

I usually get their italian beef sandwiches, and they have always been seasoned well and you can get a small cup of au jus on the side for pretty cheap (and you don't necessarily need it).  All in all, their pizza and side items are delicious.  It's also nice to support local rather than do the national chain restaurants."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I've had many carry out dinners from Rosati's and man, are they good! I always know what I order will be cooked perfectly and taste delicious. One of my personal favorites is the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, for only $5.99 you get an amazingly large sandwich that will fill you up. I usually add au jus for only $0.25 more. Funny thing, I've yet to try their pizza's (I'm usually just grabbing someone on the go) but I am certain, and have confidence, that it will be just as delicious as their other menu items, if not better!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,This is one of my husband's favorite pizza spots in Madison. We like dining in and enjoy the casual atmosphere of the dining room. I love the chopped salad!
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Ordered pizza to our hotel on thanksgiving for my family. It came quickly, was exactly what we ordered and the pizza was really good. Only reason for the 4 instead of 5 is the veggie pizza didn't have many vegetables on it."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Most know Rosati's for pizza and take out, but they have so much more including an eat in dinning room.  There pizza is great, but you also need to try the ribs and fries, chicago hot dogs, and pastas.  They have dinning room specials every night that are an incredible deal!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,Great pizza. Free popcorn. 3.50 for wine. Great specials nighly. Good salads too. A steal.
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Thank you, iPhone!  You took us to Rosati's, and we were delighted with everything:  the waitress, the coziness, the friendly customers there with us; and, of, course, the deep dish Chicago pan pizza. The slightly sweet, crisp crust; the savory sausage; the nutty warm cheese; that wonderful sauce!  We will be back!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,Wow.   Terribly disappointed.    Pizza was cold.  Sauce was tasteless.  Had veggie pizza and spinach/tomato bread.  Bland.   Will never order from here again.
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Terrible service... First off started by ordering over the phone a pick up for pizza and wings... Had done so a few times over the past for delivery and   had no problems with their sandwiches and the service was decent enough to consider okay... Clearly was not trying to get anything for free seeing as I called simply as courtesy call letting them know to cook the pizza slightly longer.. its also so close to me about a block away.. the pizza was not done at all the middle was extremely doughy and probably needed to be in the oven for just over another 5 minutes. The person I asked to talk to was apparently the manager or supposedly I should say. Really wondering who trained him because basically argued with me over five minutes  without hearing anything I had to say. conversation on his end was clearly unintelligent.. Felt like I was talking to a child throwing a fit to get his way with no argument. Again wasn't trying to get anything for free was just stating the fact that their pizza was not done... In the midst of a general manager: arguing with me I decided to end the conversation with a"" I will no longer ever order a single thing from this restaurant again ""and he was okay with it!!!...  For them it sucks.. Try Cafe la bellitalia or portabella"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Amazing place. I'm often too hungry to be patient here, but am never disappointed.
Knowing how good the food is, it's VERY hard to be patient... And some days we've had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. But it was well worth it, I think. Have never been able to finish an order from here (portions are VERY generous)... Great leftovers! Their pasta is amazing and their pizza is one of the best in town.

I've only dined in, never carried out. The dining room isn't huge, but you won't feel like you're suffocating. The lighting is a little dim, and they often have Dean Martin playing in the background. Flat screens at every corner, I believe-- you'll never miss a game or breaking news! Ha!

The service is almost always good. The servers are always very nice.

First time writing a review for this place (and in general), but I will be sure to add any more info if necessary.

Definitely a place to go, any time of the week! You won't regret it!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I ordered from Rosati's for the first time in a couple years and the pizza is still just fine (this time I went for The Veggie) but what I really wanted were good breadsticks. I'd never tried theirs, but figured since they had decent crust, a decent breadstick would follow. Unfortunately, logic failed me in this department. 

The price of the breadsticks on the menu were cheap ($2.99), and the quality followed suit. I'm convinced that they are not made in-house, as they were extremely bland and had that spongy, white-bread quality you'd find in a plastic-wrapped package you'd pick up in the grocery store. Another menu item, Nuggets, are billed as pieces of crispy pizza dough tossed in garlic butter sauce. Those go for $6.49, and should have tipped me off that the breadsticks were probably not the best choice. 

The upside in the long run is that I'll have consumed less bread, but giving me SyscoStix (my own name that I wouldn't be at all surprised to find is a real product) instead of just cutting up some pizza dough was a star-dropping move. What else can't they be bothered to make?"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I thought the pizza was okay, but not spectacular. I probably won't return."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I'll judge Rosati's by what they claim to be: an ""Authentic Chicago"" restaurant featuring pizza, italian beef, and hot dogs. I think they did a very mediocre impression of Chicago's classic food. 

The thin crust pizza was my favorite: pretty crunchy crust with flavorful sauce and enough cheese (nothing too much but it was at least more than a national chain like Papa Johns. The toppings weren't as plentiful as I'd like. Each slice had two or three pepperoni pieces with a couple sausage bits. I thought the taste reminded me of a Chicago thin crust pizza but was not up to its level. 

For the Italian beef, it was not comparable at all. Very below-average. Flavorless without copious amounts of either Au jus or giardiniera. The french roll was too soft and had no exterior crisp to it. 

The prices are a tad high, but for a place that calls itself a specialty restaurant they are what you'd expect. Service is pretty fast and friendly. Overall three stars sums it up: Mediocre."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Ordered for delivery to work today with a group of folks. I can't speak on the topic of their pizzas, but as for my portion of the order...

First, the price quoted for a personal pizza over the phone was higher than stated on the menu on the website. As well, my portion of the order was charged a separate delivery charge from the main order - though it was all delivered together. 

Second, the garlic bread was burnt, tough, and gross. Even if you were willing to handle the texture and crumbling bread, you could taste burnt garlic, not just burnt bread. We threw it away. 

Third, the personal pan pizza (cheese with pineapple). I've had better pizza at various fastfood chains that don't claim to be ""authentic Chicago pizza"". The sauce especially - yuck. As stated in other reviews, extremely greasy and messy. 

If you want good pizza in Madison, go to Ian's."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,placed order for 2 pizzas one came wrong had company over. we had the choice for a 2 dollar credit or wait for another pizza. obviously we ordered the type of pizza we did for a reason. we were told a new pizza would be sent right out. have waited over 1 hour for correct pizza. so all together with company for lunch we have waited 2 plus hours. pizza is good but not worth the hassle.  which is sad because probably one of the best pizza in madison however will probably never order again.
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"I know it's a pizza place - but I have to say, I've never actually eaten pizza there. For me, this is where I go when I have a craving for a Chicago-style hot dog and can't make a run down I-90 to Portillo's. They use yummy Vienna Beef dogs (of course), topped with the usual condiments. (Cute side note: they make mention of ketchup on the menu - that it doesn't belong on a Chicago dog, but they'll do it if they have to.)

The place is not fancy - a few booths, red checkered tablecloths. The service is friendly, but not overbearing. (Food, refills, and check arrived exactly when they should.) I'll be back. And one day, I hope to check out their location in Tucson!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"We had a cheese pan pizza. If you are looking for Chicago style deep dish, this is not the place to find it.  The crust was pretty bland, there was very little sauce and the cheese was just ok.  Overall the pizza was bland, with too much crust compared to sauce and cheese. We probably won't return here, at least not for the pan pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"(First Yelp review)

First time ordering through Rosati's.  I'm tired of pizza, so I thought I'd try to mix it up a bit and get a sandwich and some sides: meatball parm, garlic wings, and cheese fries.

The delivery went OK, no complaints there.  The delivery charge was reasonable (about half that of most folks on Grubhub) and the timing was decent.  The food, however was an absolute travesty.

- SO MUCH SALT.  I was unable to finish a single dish because everything was drenched in salt.  The bread, the cheese, the meatballs.... all one big briny mess.  

- The cheese on the sandwich was felt plasticky and tasteless.  I'm pretty sure the cheese on the cheese fries came out of a can.  Maybe I expected too much from a restaurant in Wisconsin (I didn't realize Rosati's was a chain.  I was thinking more along the lines of AJ's in Verona), but I always expect the cheese to be good, at least.

- The garlic bread was hard instead of crispy, salty instead of garlicky.

- The one positive was that that the Diet Coke was cold.

So, in the future... no.  Maybe I just got a bad sample, but it was bad enough that I'm not going to give it another shot."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Every one that worked there was extremely rude, when ordering my pizza the guy was rude, the server was also extreuy rude and we were not given a seat and had to wait for a long time when there were many seats open, then get this about half way threw are food we were told we had to move because it was getting bussy and a bigger party was comeing in with no reservation, smh rosaties smh"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Agh! This is the only place you can get baked ziti in Madison like I could get on Long Island. I love it! Of course it isn't called baked ziti, but it's the same darned thing. I've been there twice in a row, and it's absolutely delicious. Their marinara is really fresh and good, too.

The pizza however isn't so hot."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Being a recovering former Flatlander I was well familiar with Rosati's before I moved to Madison. Having gone to several of them around Chicago I've found there to be a lot of variation from individual restaurant in the chain. I just wanted to make that clear so I identified that it was this specific Rosati's I was talking about.

Anyhow! I've ordered pizza from them a half a dozen times in a couple of years and have dined in once. They are my Go-To for ""as-near-to-real-Chicago-style-as-I-can-get"" pizza in Madison and they do it well. The crust is perfectly crisped, the cheese thick as it should be, and the toppings generous. They have a well seasoned sausage that I just love. I will note that when I order from them I *do* ask for less sauce on top as they have occasionally gone wild with it (and sauce gone wild just is nothing anyone should have to deal with).

Anyhow -- I've had other things from them as well and I have to say their pasta has not wowed me but it is pretty good. Their biggest weakness seems to be their sauce; It just needs more flavor or at least a stronger flavor. 

For the bread lover you'll want to hit up the Nuggets but don't do it alone. If you think these are a side order for one person you will find yourself awash in a tide of deliciously fried, lightly sauced goodness that your heart may not recover from. 

The service when I had dined in was good; I didn't go long without a refill and they checked in often enough that we knew they were watching but not so often that it was obnoxious. There was a little delay before we ordered but that can happen when it gets busy so I am not about to begrudge them that.

Their Chicago-style really is the closest to downtown Chicago I've had since I've been up here and that alone will keep me coming back indefinitely... or at least until Gino's or Giordano's crawl their way up I-90."
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,"Their pizza is a joke! They advertise ""Chicago style"" pizza but they clearly know nothing about it. After waiting over an hour for our delivery, I opened the box to discover the most pathetic pizza I have ever seen. The crust was extremely thin and dry-more like a burned cookie. Presentation was awful! Whoever cut the pizza cut some sample sized pieces that were embarrassing to serve to family and friends that we were visiting. The manager did nothing to remedy the situation. In fact, he agreed that one would find a better value in a frozen, grocery store pizza. Extremely rude! Do NOT eat here!"
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,Ok. I have been a lover of Chicago Deep Dish pizza for many years. I know how it is supposed to be done. I recently relocated to Madison Wi. I was over joyed to find that there was a Rosatis near me. So I figured I would give them a try. I ordered a 12 inch Chicago Deep Dish. The staff was very helpful with me picking out my size so I did not over order. When the pizza got here I couldn't was to dig in. It looked amazing. They must use some butter in the crust. It was the best Chicago pizza I have had in a long time. I will definitely be ordering from here a lot!!  I give them five stars cause there wasn't ten!!
Rosati's Pizza,sausage pizza slice,Good food. Good service. I like spicy Italian beef on garlic bread and their stuffed pizza (buttery crust). 4 stars.
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I had extremely high hopes for this place and was let down. The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the extra $2 charge for the meatballs seems over-the-top. I ordered the Cheef sandwich and my Dad ordered the Philly Cheesesteak but based on our experience they are the exact same sandwich. The Cheef says it comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers...when I asked for both I got charged 49 cents twice for the peppers. The menu says nothing about an extra charge for these items but says you can add them to other sandwiches for a charge. In my experience when it says ""comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers"" you shouldn't have to pay extra for those peppers. Both of the sandwiches were alright though they came with an ample amount of fillings. Both of the sandwiches came with beef and although there was plenty of the beef it was basically flavorless. The only flavor mine had was from the $1 worth of peppers. The desserts were also very disappointing. The picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade. The tiramisu we got was a frozen, pre-packaged triangle that didn't have much flavor. The two cannolis we got were also pre-packaged and frozen but actually had really good flavor. All-in-all I'm pretty disappointed.

I would consider going back to try the Chicago style hot dogs and their pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Food is always great.  Give a little love to the waitstaff, though.  On one night, I was worried for the girl who took my order.  She made a mistake and I got the impression that mgmt. would not be pleased with her if she did the right thing by the customer.  She should have been able, at the very least (in my opinion) to give me 50% discount on the pizza only, if the error resulted in wasting half the pizza.  I didn't argue with the meager offer of 25%.  I remembered my niece's experiences while working there at one point and immediately related to the anxiety the staff was experiencing.  If you can tell the mgmt. when their staff is great, maybe this will help them forge better relations with their employees.  Obviously, if they enable their staff to give superior service, they will win more than loyal customers, they will gain happy and confident employees.  If I were the type of customer that demanded fairness and could not see the fear of the boss in this employee, things would have escalated and that would have been silly.  Silly because in a lot of restaurants they would simply buy the loyal customer the entire pizza!  Again, great food!!  I will make sure I do my part in the future and repeat my order a couple times to help out the busy and helpful staff."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I've been ordering from Rosati's West since I moved to Madison. However, since they raised their prices, I don't feel like their meals are competitive anymore -- there's a lot of good other pizza joints around here. Also, their ""customer service"" is kinda crappy. Obviously, small mistakes happen - and they have multiple times before - (e.g. being charged for mayos that should have been included) but I never thought of writing a review up until tonight. 

So, amongst other things, I ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds. Both came plain, with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Cheese curds also came with no sauce. I was not asked what I wanted with curds/ on sandwiches during the order and I definitely did not say that I wanted them plain, as witnessed by two other people in the room while I placed the order. When I called back, the kid told me that I ordered plain & cheese curds with no sauce. You know, if I don't explicitly say that you want lettuce, tomato and mayo, but your menu says that it comes with it, you just put in on it, period. Kid said (with an attitude) that he will put in a note for the next time... there will be no next time! It's not like I wanted my money back... all they needed to say was sorry, it's not going to happen again."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",We had the dough nuggets and a deep dish pizza. Both were delicious. Staff was friendly.
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Worst pizza ever. They have no idea how to make a pizza.
They advertise ""Chicago Style"" , they don't have any idea what that is.
The only reason I am giving it one star is because there isn't a negative star !!!"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Rosati's gets two stars this time but it could get three or four. The potential is there and if you're going to have pizza in this strip mall, I'd choose the dark, dingy Rosati's over the more wide open, brighter Dahmen's every single time.

On our last visit, it was a Saturday around lunchtime and the place was surprisingly busy. The waitress had her hands full, but she held her own. My son and I each ordered a slice of pizza. Mine was served at room temperature. There goes one star. Make it two. The crust on their Chicago-style pizza is chewier, in an overcooked or not-very-fresh sort of way, and less flavorful than others in Chicago, and Madison for that matter. There goes another star. Make a wish. Mine is for a fresher slice of pizza. In past visits, we've had the thin crust. I think Rosati's does this much better.

My daughter had mostaccioli with sauce and butter on the side. Anyone can do that, so I'm not going to rate the entree, but I will say the marinara is fresh, thick and well-seasoned. The cheesy garlic bread is a guilty pleasure and a must-order every time, especially when dipped in that marinara. We've had the Friday fish fry. Skip it, but that's on us for ordering a fish fry at a pizza joint. 

We go to Rosati's fairly frequently and will be back. I think the solution to making this place awesome might be a just a little more attention to quality control."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I have mostly had a good experience here. I prefer the thin crust over the deep dish (a sin being this close to Chicago). Their other food besides pizza is excellent, from fish sandwiches to pasta to burgers."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. I ordered a large pepperoni and a medium vegetarian pizza and two small salads and it cost me over $50. The pizza were to be delivered within 45 minutes to an hour and it took an hour and 30 minutes. I opened the boxes to find the thinnest crust I have ever seen on a pizza and they were supposed to be Chicago style. I am not kidding if they were  1/4 inch deep that would be stretching it. There were no identifiable toppings on the pizza except for two pepperoni. Nothing on the vegetarian pizza.
I called to speak with the manager and he was quite rude. I've told me that he was not the one that ordered the pizzas and I could probably get a better pizza in the grocery store. He also asked me to not post a negative review because it would hurt his four children.
I would not recommend this pizza place."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Picked up 2 Chicago Deep Dish pizzas for lunch after a night on the town. 1 pizza was veggies, the other sausage, hot peppers, and mushrooms. Basically the taste of cheese dominated these pizzas with a seldom taste of topping -- a cheese bomb."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","This pizza is good to get if you have a big group and you don't want to spend too much money on a more high end pizza. 
The pizza has a thin crust, but the crust isn't delicious, which is disappointing, since I love the crusts of pizzas. The flavors are mediocre, and I've never ordered this pizza myself before."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Dined inside Rosati's for the first time on a Sunday night. I dined alone that night but craved pizza, so I opted for a calzone so I did not over-order. The mozzarella was deliciously gooey. The sausage stood out. I also ordered the calzone with fresh garlic and red onion which gave it a great balance.

My only regret about this visit is that I didn't get a deep dish pizza instead -- I get the impression that if their toppings are this great, their deep dish probably won't disappoint. Will be coming back again when I get a chance. Maybe with friends this time!"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Well, I guess I have to up this review to four stars since I can't get enough of Rosati's Italian beef.  I have absolutely no idea how authentic it is, but since Rosati's is a Chicago-based chain, I'm guessing it's pretty close to the real deal.  Anyway, it's delicious, and the portions are extremely generous for what you pay (although the delivery charge still sucks).  

Also, thin crust pizza is the way to go here.  It's still pretty greasy, but not as bad as the thicker crusts.  The individual-size pizza is pretty big for just one person and at a good price."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","The lighting is subdued, the decor quaint, and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. I liked the hand-painted wall murals and the Rosati's Italian sauce cans that bordered the ceiling. Adele music filled the small restaurant that has just six booths and three tables. It was very pleasant. Rosati's was busy the entire time we were there - there were always one or two groups waiting to be seated. Our server (Lindsey) was spectacular. We ordered a medium Chicago style pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onion, mushroom and black olive. It was much too much pizza - they are very generous with the toppings. The pizza was very good. The prices were reasonable. It is a great place for a couple or a small group (4-5) to enjoy a pizza/pasta night."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",The food is of poor quality. The crust is close to cardboard. The salad did not taste good. The server asked us if we wanted more drinks and and we had to ask again to get them. We won't be returning.
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","There is no doubt that this is the only TRUE pizza in Madison...Those who run with the masses and order the sugary cheap chain pizzas have no clue as to what they are missing.  Treat yourselves someday to the crispy THIN PIZZA with Non-sugary sauce, perfectly spiced, with GENEROUS toppings and tons of melty cheese...ALWAYS delivered HOT.....MELTY....PERFECT..even in single digit temps...Rosati's Sausage is incredible BTW...their own recipe ....I insist you try the Chicago STYLE also some night ...It is BEYOND wonderful and balanced in flavors and textures...from the buttery flakey crust to the rich tomatoey sauce and the generous fillings not to mention the ooooozey cheeses..Check the menu for other items also ..like if you crave (or never even tried) a REAL Chicago Beef...THIS is the place..I get mine"" wet, no cheese, hot Giardiniera"" ...it is AMAZING  and HUGE!!
Ok  well enough bragging about my favorite Madison Place for Take out...but..Trust me  you will NOT be disappointed...i would never lie to you"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","This place is phenomenal. Whenever we want pizza, this is the place we want to get it from, even if fast food pizza is cheaper. Great Chicago style pizza, in the opinion of this former Chicago native."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",Ordered Rosati's for the first time last night.... YUM!! Delivery was faster than expected. Cheese pizza was simple but very tasty. Also got little bite-sized desserts that came with Nutella... heaven!! Will definitely order again :)
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Life's too short to eat mediocre pizza.  That pretty much sums up my feelings about Rosati's.  Stranded on the west side and in need of lunch, the WaunaQueen and I decided to give Rosati's a shot.  She ordered a slice of the pepperoni, I opted the Cheef sandwich, Italian Beef with covered with melted mozzarella cheese.

Both offerings were exceptionally mediocre.  The crust reminded me of what you get with a frozen pizza, dense, overly chewy and flavorless.  The sauce had that overcooked, right out of a can flavor.  The greasy cheese and pepperoni followed the exceedingly mediocre theme to a T.  To make matters worse, my wife's slice came out warm at best, so she had to have the kitchen put it in the oven to warm it up. 

The Italian Beef sandwich had little going for it in the flavor department, whether it be the spongy bread, the melted slab of chewy mozzarella cheese or the watery ju that accompanied the sandwich.  I appreciated the generous serving of beef, but man oh man, I'd trade less beef for more flavor.  The crinkle-cut fries came out warm and limp.

Service at the front counter was pleasant and efficient.  The person at the counter cheerfully greeted us as we entered the restaurant and granted our request for a side of feta cheese to go with my daughter slice of cheese pizza.  With a variety of lunch specials, you do not need to spend a fortune on your lunch here.  

The dining room could serve as a set for Goodfellas, with the Italian music wafting over the speakers, the red and white checked (plastic) tablecloths, elevated private booths and a minimal amount of sunlight filtering in though a small window.    The two big screens TVs detracted from the ambiance, but I did appreciate being able check the score of the World Cup match taking place that day.

If you are looking for cheap and filling, this is your place.  If you are looking for delicious, keep driving past this strip mall outpost."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",The pan style pizza was perfect with a non dry cluster! Service was good with a typical family style setting with checkered table clothes. The gyro pizza was excellent.
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",I received a coupon in the mail for a free pizza and they wouldn't honor it. I'd be more upset if they were better than second rate.
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Pizza was pretty good, considering it was delivered.
Sauce is well-balanced and not sweet (a huge plus!).
Cheese seemed to be of high quality.
The thicker crust was not to my personal preference (the in-between of the thin and deepdish).  I did like the thin crust.
I'd definitely order again."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","This place was pretty good. Perhaps the better pizza outside of downtown. We ordered a gyro pizza on the thin crust which was really quite good. They make a yummy pizza.

On the downside, the ceaser salad was a few torn pieces of romaine, shred of parmesan, and a vinegar based ceaser dressing. Not good. No effort to actually make it a dish worth eating. For comparison Lou Malnatis makes an excellent ceaser salad. Also, free breadsticks with the pizza for the monday special were alright. Better than the salad but not worth buying if they ain't free although the marinara sauce tasted pretty good. A simple tomatoey marinara.

So I would come again but avoid the side dishes and stick to the main events."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I've had Rosati's in Chicago and always thought they were a decent pizza, certainly not top 10, but good for a change of pace from the typical places.

I stopped by this location since it was near my hotel and I learned they also served Italian Beef sammies, which are hard to find outside the Chicago area -- so they were getting my business after a 12 hour, no lunch work day.

Since I had to get an Italian Beef, I also got a thin crust personal pizza (it was my first meal all day, don't judge me!) , in hopes that their thin crust was better than my memories of their deep dish back in Chicago.

Unfortunately, while the Italian Beef was much better than expected, the Pizza was not. It wasn't bad, it was just bland and reminded me much like a kit pizza you would get at a bowling alley."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Excellent pizza. I use dot eat here quite a bit. It is more expensive, but you get what you pay for. The other menu items have always been very good also. Definitely would recommend."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Chicago style pizza! Yes! It had to be authentic Chicago style, since I don't believe I had it ever. Only thing I ever that was remotely close was Bostonized, but that ain't Chicago - at least where I live. Used to the normal chains of Dominos, Pizza Hut, and the rest of them, but coming to a Chicago style pie joint is possibility made in heaven, I gotta say. After getting my pint of chocolate ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery relatively nearby, my Fitchburg friends and I stopped here at Rosati's for a delicious pie that could not be beat.

Located on Mineral Pointe Road in the heart of Fitchburg, there is no shortage of parking spaces here, unless you have come on prime time and need a space. Rosati's is within the Clock Tower shopping complex on Mineral Pointe road, nearby the Saigon Noodles I had been to the night before on Odana Road. Plenty of food choices out here. With that in mind, my friend and I ordered take out instead of dining in, so this review is just for the counter service and the food items we bought. I had ordered the 14"" Rosati Monster with the double stuffed crust, along with a side order of mozzarella sticks.

Let me tell you that I had thought about getting the 16"", but when that 14"" came out, that monster was crazy huge! And I thought I could have tanked a medium Pizza Hut pizza without any problems. I guess they don't call it the Rosati Monster for nothing! The pizza itself was a meaty cheesy monstrosity that could not be tamed in one sitting. I tried my best, but I could just manage half of it while saving myself for Cold Stone, which I took out 1/4 of it along with the mozzarella sticks before calling it a night. Guess ill be having the rest of it for breakfast and lunch sometime. The pizza itself was rather good and heavy, so that was a feast in itself. I really did enjoy myself with this pizza and hope to do it again soon. The mix of meaty and cheesy was so good, I guess that mixture is total bliss. And it was!

The counter service was ok at best. Everyone was moving around like it was crazy busy that night, but whatever works to get everyone's orders straight and make everyone happy and satisfied. They take credit cards, so that always awesome. That made me happy. They also have a dining area / restaurant, so that's nifty, if you choose to dine in here one of these days. Glad we phoned our order in, otherwise, we would have been waiting quite a long time for our order. Glad we made a pitstop at Cold Stone first before coming here. Overall, this plus is a serious recommend for sure. If you enjoy Chicago deep dish and Authentic made, this place is the one to go to. Just 3 hour drive northwest of Chicago, its pretty much the closest to the heart of Chicago if you are craving something from the source, but not willing to drive to the source. Rosati's is your best bet ever!

Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","We only ever get carry-out from Rosati's, but it's always fast and delicious.  Both the pizza and the lasagna keep us coming back.  That being said, the crust is a little on the chewy side and the salads are very plain.  The service is average, everyone usually looks like they're in a big hurry but they always get our order to us without much fuss.  We give them steady business and have not yet had a bad experience."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","If you need a Chicago food fix, come here.  The Italian beefs are solid and so is the chicken parm.  Pizza is so-so."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I lived in or near Chicago for most of my life, and have frequented some of the best Chicago pizza restaurants in the Chicago area, including the original Pizzeria Uno (and Due), Lou Matti's and other more local favorites.  I used to deliver for a Rosati's franchise in the Chicago suburbs, and came to appreciate the finer points of this food genre while working there.

This Rosati's franchise is not the best I've seen, but it has improved greatly since I placed my first order there 4 years ago.  The variety of crust/pan choices is something that's unique to Rosati's.  The double dough and the ""Chicago style"" pan are my favorites.  Unlike some other local pizza places, they put the sauce all over the crust, and don't skimp on toppings.  Other favorites are the baked lasagna and chicken sandwich.

I'm a 100% delivery customer, and the drivers who bring my orders are great guys.  I tip them well and they never let me down.

Pluses: the variety of food choices for a pizza place:

Minuses: They close too early for my hours."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","We tried the Chicago style pizza and hot buffalo wings. Both were good, but neither was particularly noteworthy. The pizza had a very thick and somewhat doughy crust and a good amount of cheese and toppings. The sauce is a little on the bland side and the two pizzas I ordered both failed to travel particularly well even though it wasn't a terribly long drive home. The first small pizza was sausage and pepperoni and it was probably the better of the two. The sausage was somewhat on the bland side with very little in the way of savory or spicy flavor. That being said, the texture of the sausage was really good and the amount on the pizza was generous. The pepperoni was also pretty good, but not being on top of the pie during cooking means it doesn't brown up nicely and it gets a little lost. The other small pizza was veggie and it was also good, but somewhat on the bland side. The veggies give up a fair bit of liquid during cooking so this pizza did not hold together structurally as well as the other. The cheese on both was abundant but not exciting and lacked some of the amazing pull that comes on the very best pizzas. 

The wings were cooked nicely, although maybe one more minute in the fryer wouldn't have hurt. These wing are breaded then fried which makes them slightly heavier than non-breaded wings. The hot buffalo sauce was good, but again, nothing special. 

Rosati's was good pizza and I would be curious to try their thin crust options, but there are much better options in Madison and incomparably better options in Chicago. I also thought it was a little silly to be charged $0.53 for a side of hot giardinaire on a $48 order of two small pizzas and wings. Not the end of the world by any means, but still a little lackluster."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Just about as perfect as a Chicago-style pizza can get. Their sauce was excellent, and their crust is superb! Sauce on top, just like it should be, piled with loads of toppings and cheese!

Service was ok - she kept my drink filled. They only had one server though, and they got busy quickly, so she was very frantic and all over the place.

Appetizer sampler was ok, but nothing to write home about."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","This pizza place has a lot of good things going for it! My work recently catered in lunch and I was able to sample some of their thin crust pizza offerings. 

My initial thought was ""this is not thin crust"" - but when I think thin, I think cracker thin. That being said a cracker crust would never hold-up to the glorious amount of stretchy cheese and toppings that are present in every bite - so gooey! 

The establishment remains true to its claim of authentic ""Chicago"" style with hand-crafted Italian sausage present on many items. I tried the Godfather and I really like the addition of giardiniera and this was far and away my favorite specialty pizza. The sauce was good - not too sweet - and portioned out mildly enough not to over power the bite.

Overall it's good pizza and worth the extra couple of dollars for something far more substantial then your average chain!"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","It would have been nice to see if they actually HAVE good pizza. I went into their dining room and waited to be seated. Two waitresses and only one table occupied.  Despite being only five feet from them, neither bothered to acknowledge me or ask if I wanted to sit down. They were too busy talking and deciding which CD to play. After waiting for a time, I walked out.  I couldn't believe how rude they were."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. 

Much of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. 

Rosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right. 

Eat up and leave your calorie counter at home ... or else it may explode."

Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",Great food and decent service. It was the first time we tried Chicago style pizza and we loved it!

Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","BLEH! Do not ... NOT ... order anything but pizza for delivery, and have tons of napkins or paper towels available to sop up the grease on that. We ordered baked lasagna dinner and ribs with fries dinner tonight. Fries were sloppy floppy sticky starch sticks I wouldn't give my pups (and they love their fries!). I had about 3 bites of the overly bbq'd undercooked ribs before I stopped because I didn't want to become ill. Cooked ribs should not be gray. Apparently the lasagna was ok, he ate that. 

Last time for this place."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","The 2 hot dog combo is a great deal - Chicago-style dogs are so expensive around here, so 2 dogs, really good fries and a drink for $6 works for me.  I also tried the Italian Beef and it was just right - just like home.  Our service was excellent both times we've visitied.  I would go five stars, but this weekend my wife ordered the ""double dough"" pizza and I tried it - pretty disapointingly dry bland crust.  I'm certainly going to try the deep-dish sometime...maybe I'll change my review after that - 5star if it's great and down to 3 if it stinks."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","As a transplant from Chicago, one of the most difficult adjustments to Madison life has been the lack of quality pizza.  It boggles my mind that we are in such a vast wasteland when it comes to pizza!  And to find a dine in pizza place with decent offering is even more difficult.  I grew up on thin crust Chicago style. Rosati ' s has the best I've come across in my search for a taste of home. They use cheese that tastes like cheese., and Chicago style Italian sausage.  I do recommend ordering the thin ""double crust"" as the standard is too thin and cracker - like. 

Atmosphere is okay.  I wish I didn't have to listen to continuous Frank Sinatra every time for the entire duration of the meal.

Customer service was minimal.  I'm not one to expect the server to carry on long conversation.  But when they ask how we're enjoying the meal, it would be nice if they, at least, pretended as if they were listening /cared. 

Value is about what I expect for a dine in pizza.  Sixteen inch double crust sausage and bacon (we always get more than necessary to have leftovers.) Was about  $21.

Definitely a favorite when our stomachs are missing home. (I would give 3.5 stars of Yelp allowed.)"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","The best pizza in Madison.
Don't listen to the other reviews.
Everybody knows rosatis is the best.
Pizza,sandwiches we have had it all and its all excellent food."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Really disappointed in the regular, large, pepperoni pizza.

I live near their Mineral Point location and since I can't seem to find a decent Italian spot, much less a pizza, in Madison..... I tried Rosati's.

This is my 2nd time ordering a pizza from them.  The first time they burnt it so when we ate it all we tasted was a char taste. Well, this one wasn't burnt, but instead of tasting the burnt taste, I tasted the sauce. Which tasted like Spaghettio sauce. Not a whole lot of cheese on there. The crust was thinner than I expected as I didn't order a ""thin crust"", just regular... *shrug* 

My husband and I both had a ""WTF"" moment and said that it tasted like a Tombstone. Then I said, ""Not even a Tombstone! Maybe a Jack's frozen pizza!"" Literally had me wishing I didn't waste $16 on this.

The 2nd star comes from the Italian Beef they have there. They are really good, and huge portion for the price. Wishing I would have ordered that instead of the pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Rosati's is my favorite pizza in the Madison area.  There's something magical about the sauce, cheese, and their italian sausage (we roll simple in my household)...  Very few pizzas give me that satisfying ""hunger quenching"" feeling that Rosati's gives me.  Unfortunately, that leads to the problem of not knowing when to stop!  But that's my problem, not theirs...

I've carried out for lunch as well as ate in with the family.  I've never been disappointed!  The kids love it.  I love it.  My extended family loves it.  It's awesome.  The grab-and-go lunch options are nice too (I work nearby)."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","This is our go to pizza place when we want food delivered right to our door or my husband wants to do a quick carryout. We live a few miles down the road and we normally wait between 45 minutes to an hour for deliveries, but only around 20 minutes for carryout. 

I would say 90% of the time we get this, our food is great for a chain pizza joint. We prefer it much more over Dominos or Pizza Hut. The few times our food is sub par is usually when we order food that isn't pizza. The last couple of times, for example, we ordered jalapeño poppers as a side and when they showed up, all of the breading had fallen off inside the box. There have been other times, however, where they come perfectly fine. I think it depends on the day.

The staff have always been very friendly, but we have never actually sat down to eat inside the restaurant so I cannot comment as to the environment. It always seems clean when we are waiting in line for our carryout orders. The delivery staff is always extremely friendly. They even delivered to our specific hotel room a couple of times when my apartment had flooded and I had to move out for repairs.

Overall, if you are looking for some decent pizza at a fairly cheap price (for the Madison area), this is a good place!"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I've been here before, and again, it has surpassed my expectations and has always delivered (no pun intended).  I usually only get delivery and that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour, but it's worth the wait.  This time I ordered a stuffed crust pizza - I was expecting more of a sandwich/calzone stuffed pizza, but they basically have cheese and toppings between two layers of crust and then the sauce on the top.  Still pretty delicious, but a lot like Chicago for me, which is not a bad thing. 

Also, I ordered a small batch of wings (spicy garlic) and they were delicious.  It is hard to find good wings from restaurants that don't feature them, but they did a great job!

I usually get their italian beef sandwiches, and they have always been seasoned well and you can get a small cup of au jus on the side for pretty cheap (and you don't necessarily need it).  All in all, their pizza and side items are delicious.  It's also nice to support local rather than do the national chain restaurants."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I've had many carry out dinners from Rosati's and man, are they good! I always know what I order will be cooked perfectly and taste delicious. One of my personal favorites is the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich, for only $5.99 you get an amazingly large sandwich that will fill you up. I usually add au jus for only $0.25 more. Funny thing, I've yet to try their pizza's (I'm usually just grabbing someone on the go) but I am certain, and have confidence, that it will be just as delicious as their other menu items, if not better!"

Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Terrible service... First off started by ordering over the phone a pick up for pizza and wings... Had done so a few times over the past for delivery and   had no problems with their sandwiches and the service was decent enough to consider okay... Clearly was not trying to get anything for free seeing as I called simply as courtesy call letting them know to cook the pizza slightly longer.. its also so close to me about a block away.. the pizza was not done at all the middle was extremely doughy and probably needed to be in the oven for just over another 5 minutes. The person I asked to talk to was apparently the manager or supposedly I should say. Really wondering who trained him because basically argued with me over five minutes  without hearing anything I had to say. conversation on his end was clearly unintelligent.. Felt like I was talking to a child throwing a fit to get his way with no argument. Again wasn't trying to get anything for free was just stating the fact that their pizza was not done... In the midst of a general manager: arguing with me I decided to end the conversation with a"" I will no longer ever order a single thing from this restaurant again ""and he was okay with it!!!...  For them it sucks.. Try Cafe la bellitalia or portabella"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Amazing place. I'm often too hungry to be patient here, but am never disappointed.
Knowing how good the food is, it's VERY hard to be patient... And some days we've had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. But it was well worth it, I think. Have never been able to finish an order from here (portions are VERY generous)... Great leftovers! Their pasta is amazing and their pizza is one of the best in town.

I've only dined in, never carried out. The dining room isn't huge, but you won't feel like you're suffocating. The lighting is a little dim, and they often have Dean Martin playing in the background. Flat screens at every corner, I believe-- you'll never miss a game or breaking news! Ha!

The service is almost always good. The servers are always very nice.

First time writing a review for this place (and in general), but I will be sure to add any more info if necessary.

Definitely a place to go, any time of the week! You won't regret it!"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I ordered from Rosati's for the first time in a couple years and the pizza is still just fine (this time I went for The Veggie) but what I really wanted were good breadsticks. I'd never tried theirs, but figured since they had decent crust, a decent breadstick would follow. Unfortunately, logic failed me in this department. 

The price of the breadsticks on the menu were cheap ($2.99), and the quality followed suit. I'm convinced that they are not made in-house, as they were extremely bland and had that spongy, white-bread quality you'd find in a plastic-wrapped package you'd pick up in the grocery store. Another menu item, Nuggets, are billed as pieces of crispy pizza dough tossed in garlic butter sauce. Those go for $6.49, and should have tipped me off that the breadsticks were probably not the best choice. 

The upside in the long run is that I'll have consumed less bread, but giving me SyscoStix (my own name that I wouldn't be at all surprised to find is a real product) instead of just cutting up some pizza dough was a star-dropping move. What else can't they be bothered to make?"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I thought the pizza was okay, but not spectacular. I probably won't return."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I'll judge Rosati's by what they claim to be: an ""Authentic Chicago"" restaurant featuring pizza, italian beef, and hot dogs. I think they did a very mediocre impression of Chicago's classic food. 

The thin crust pizza was my favorite: pretty crunchy crust with flavorful sauce and enough cheese (nothing too much but it was at least more than a national chain like Papa Johns. The toppings weren't as plentiful as I'd like. Each slice had two or three pepperoni pieces with a couple sausage bits. I thought the taste reminded me of a Chicago thin crust pizza but was not up to its level. 

For the Italian beef, it was not comparable at all. Very below-average. Flavorless without copious amounts of either Au jus or giardiniera. The french roll was too soft and had no exterior crisp to it. 

The prices are a tad high, but for a place that calls itself a specialty restaurant they are what you'd expect. Service is pretty fast and friendly. Overall three stars sums it up: Mediocre."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Ordered for delivery to work today with a group of folks. I can't speak on the topic of their pizzas, but as for my portion of the order...

First, the price quoted for a personal pizza over the phone was higher than stated on the menu on the website. As well, my portion of the order was charged a separate delivery charge from the main order - though it was all delivered together. 

Second, the garlic bread was burnt, tough, and gross. Even if you were willing to handle the texture and crumbling bread, you could taste burnt garlic, not just burnt bread. We threw it away. 

Third, the personal pan pizza (cheese with pineapple). I've had better pizza at various fastfood chains that don't claim to be ""authentic Chicago pizza"". The sauce especially - yuck. As stated in other reviews, extremely greasy and messy. 

If you want good pizza in Madison, go to Ian's."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",placed order for 2 pizzas one came wrong had company over. we had the choice for a 2 dollar credit or wait for another pizza. obviously we ordered the type of pizza we did for a reason. we were told a new pizza would be sent right out. have waited over 1 hour for correct pizza. so all together with company for lunch we have waited 2 plus hours. pizza is good but not worth the hassle.  which is sad because probably one of the best pizza in madison however will probably never order again.
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","I know it's a pizza place - but I have to say, I've never actually eaten pizza there. For me, this is where I go when I have a craving for a Chicago-style hot dog and can't make a run down I-90 to Portillo's. They use yummy Vienna Beef dogs (of course), topped with the usual condiments. (Cute side note: they make mention of ketchup on the menu - that it doesn't belong on a Chicago dog, but they'll do it if they have to.)

The place is not fancy - a few booths, red checkered tablecloths. The service is friendly, but not overbearing. (Food, refills, and check arrived exactly when they should.) I'll be back. And one day, I hope to check out their location in Tucson!"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Sadly I'm downgrading Rosati's. The more I have it the worse and worse it gets.  The crust is too much like cardboard for me.  And the ingredients are really, really cheap.

Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","We had a cheese pan pizza. If you are looking for Chicago style deep dish, this is not the place to find it.  The crust was pretty bland, there was very little sauce and the cheese was just ok.  Overall the pizza was bland, with too much crust compared to sauce and cheese. We probably won't return here, at least not for the pan pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","(First Yelp review)

First time ordering through Rosati's.  I'm tired of pizza, so I thought I'd try to mix it up a bit and get a sandwich and some sides: meatball parm, garlic wings, and cheese fries.

The delivery went OK, no complaints there.  The delivery charge was reasonable (about half that of most folks on Grubhub) and the timing was decent.  The food, however was an absolute travesty.

- SO MUCH SALT.  I was unable to finish a single dish because everything was drenched in salt.  The bread, the cheese, the meatballs.... all one big briny mess.  

- The cheese on the sandwich was felt plasticky and tasteless.  I'm pretty sure the cheese on the cheese fries came out of a can.  Maybe I expected too much from a restaurant in Wisconsin (I didn't realize Rosati's was a chain.  I was thinking more along the lines of AJ's in Verona), but I always expect the cheese to be good, at least.

- The garlic bread was hard instead of crispy, salty instead of garlicky.

- The one positive was that that the Diet Coke was cold.

So, in the future... no.  Maybe I just got a bad sample, but it was bad enough that I'm not going to give it another shot."

Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Consistently excellent food, especially their lunch specials (good on weekends too), closest to the Italian beef that in used to in Chicago, no one else that I've found in madison can get it right. 

I love their thin crust pizza, never tried the Chicago style because I'll go to Chicago if I want it.  The menu coupons make it a pretty good deal too...

It seems that other reviewers ordered thin crust and expected a deep dish..."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Being a recovering former Flatlander I was well familiar with Rosati's before I moved to Madison. Having gone to several of them around Chicago I've found there to be a lot of variation from individual restaurant in the chain. I just wanted to make that clear so I identified that it was this specific Rosati's I was talking about.

Anyhow! I've ordered pizza from them a half a dozen times in a couple of years and have dined in once. They are my Go-To for ""as-near-to-real-Chicago-style-as-I-can-get"" pizza in Madison and they do it well. The crust is perfectly crisped, the cheese thick as it should be, and the toppings generous. They have a well seasoned sausage that I just love. I will note that when I order from them I *do* ask for less sauce on top as they have occasionally gone wild with it (and sauce gone wild just is nothing anyone should have to deal with).

Anyhow -- I've had other things from them as well and I have to say their pasta has not wowed me but it is pretty good. Their biggest weakness seems to be their sauce; It just needs more flavor or at least a stronger flavor. 

For the bread lover you'll want to hit up the Nuggets but don't do it alone. If you think these are a side order for one person you will find yourself awash in a tide of deliciously fried, lightly sauced goodness that your heart may not recover from. 

The service when I had dined in was good; I didn't go long without a refill and they checked in often enough that we knew they were watching but not so often that it was obnoxious. There was a little delay before we ordered but that can happen when it gets busy so I am not about to begrudge them that.

Their Chicago-style really is the closest to downtown Chicago I've had since I've been up here and that alone will keep me coming back indefinitely... or at least until Gino's or Giordano's crawl their way up I-90."
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special","Their pizza is a joke! They advertise ""Chicago style"" pizza but they clearly know nothing about it. After waiting over an hour for our delivery, I opened the box to discover the most pathetic pizza I have ever seen. The crust was extremely thin and dry-more like a burned cookie. Presentation was awful! Whoever cut the pizza cut some sample sized pieces that were embarrassing to serve to family and friends that we were visiting. The manager did nothing to remedy the situation. In fact, he agreed that one would find a better value in a frozen, grocery store pizza. Extremely rude! Do NOT eat here!"
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",Ok. I have been a lover of Chicago Deep Dish pizza for many years. I know how it is supposed to be done. I recently relocated to Madison Wi. I was over joyed to find that there was a Rosatis near me. So I figured I would give them a try. I ordered a 12 inch Chicago Deep Dish. The staff was very helpful with me picking out my size so I did not over order. When the pizza got here I couldn't was to dig in. It looked amazing. They must use some butter in the crust. It was the best Chicago pizza I have had in a long time. I will definitely be ordering from here a lot!!  I give them five stars cause there wasn't ten!!
Rosati's Pizza,"two 14"" thin crust cheese pizza tuesday special",Good food. Good service. I like spicy Italian beef on garlic bread and their stuffed pizza (buttery crust). 4 stars.
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","I had extremely high hopes for this place and was let down. The spaghetti and meatballs were ok but the extra $2 charge for the meatballs seems over-the-top. I ordered the Cheef sandwich and my Dad ordered the Philly Cheesesteak but based on our experience they are the exact same sandwich. The Cheef says it comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers...when I asked for both I got charged 49 cents twice for the peppers. The menu says nothing about an extra charge for these items but says you can add them to other sandwiches for a charge. In my experience when it says ""comes with your choice of sweet or hot peppers"" you shouldn't have to pay extra for those peppers. Both of the sandwiches were alright though they came with an ample amount of fillings. Both of the sandwiches came with beef and although there was plenty of the beef it was basically flavorless. The only flavor mine had was from the $1 worth of peppers. The desserts were also very disappointing. The picture of tiramisu on the menu was square and looked homemade. The tiramisu we got was a frozen, pre-packaged triangle that didn't have much flavor. The two cannolis we got were also pre-packaged and frozen but actually had really good flavor. All-in-all I'm pretty disappointed.

I would consider going back to try the Chicago style hot dogs and their pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Food is always great.  Give a little love to the waitstaff, though.  On one night, I was worried for the girl who took my order.  She made a mistake and I got the impression that mgmt. would not be pleased with her if she did the right thing by the customer.  She should have been able, at the very least (in my opinion) to give me 50% discount on the pizza only, if the error resulted in wasting half the pizza.  I didn't argue with the meager offer of 25%.  I remembered my niece's experiences while working there at one point and immediately related to the anxiety the staff was experiencing.  If you can tell the mgmt. when their staff is great, maybe this will help them forge better relations with their employees.  Obviously, if they enable their staff to give superior service, they will win more than loyal customers, they will gain happy and confident employees.  If I were the type of customer that demanded fairness and could not see the fear of the boss in this employee, things would have escalated and that would have been silly.  Silly because in a lot of restaurants they would simply buy the loyal customer the entire pizza!  Again, great food!!  I will make sure I do my part in the future and repeat my order a couple times to help out the busy and helpful staff."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","I've been ordering from Rosati's West since I moved to Madison. However, since they raised their prices, I don't feel like their meals are competitive anymore -- there's a lot of good other pizza joints around here. Also, their ""customer service"" is kinda crappy. Obviously, small mistakes happen - and they have multiple times before - (e.g. being charged for mayos that should have been included) but I never thought of writing a review up until tonight. 

So, amongst other things, I ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds. Both came plain, with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Cheese curds also came with no sauce. I was not asked what I wanted with curds/ on sandwiches during the order and I definitely did not say that I wanted them plain, as witnessed by two other people in the room while I placed the order. When I called back, the kid told me that I ordered plain & cheese curds with no sauce. You know, if I don't explicitly say that you want lettuce, tomato and mayo, but your menu says that it comes with it, you just put in on it, period. Kid said (with an attitude) that he will put in a note for the next time... there will be no next time! It's not like I wanted my money back... all they needed to say was sorry, it's not going to happen again."

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Rosati's gets two stars this time but it could get three or four. The potential is there and if you're going to have pizza in this strip mall, I'd choose the dark, dingy Rosati's over the more wide open, brighter Dahmen's every single time.

On our last visit, it was a Saturday around lunchtime and the place was surprisingly busy. The waitress had her hands full, but she held her own. My son and I each ordered a slice of pizza. Mine was served at room temperature. There goes one star. Make it two. The crust on their Chicago-style pizza is chewier, in an overcooked or not-very-fresh sort of way, and less flavorful than others in Chicago, and Madison for that matter. There goes another star. Make a wish. Mine is for a fresher slice of pizza. In past visits, we've had the thin crust. I think Rosati's does this much better.

My daughter had mostaccioli with sauce and butter on the side. Anyone can do that, so I'm not going to rate the entree, but I will say the marinara is fresh, thick and well-seasoned. The cheesy garlic bread is a guilty pleasure and a must-order every time, especially when dipped in that marinara. We've had the Friday fish fry. Skip it, but that's on us for ordering a fish fry at a pizza joint. 

We go to Rosati's fairly frequently and will be back. I think the solution to making this place awesome might be a just a little more attention to quality control."

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. I ordered a large pepperoni and a medium vegetarian pizza and two small salads and it cost me over $50. The pizza were to be delivered within 45 minutes to an hour and it took an hour and 30 minutes. I opened the boxes to find the thinnest crust I have ever seen on a pizza and they were supposed to be Chicago style. I am not kidding if they were  1/4 inch deep that would be stretching it. There were no identifiable toppings on the pizza except for two pepperoni. Nothing on the vegetarian pizza.
I called to speak with the manager and he was quite rude. I've told me that he was not the one that ordered the pizzas and I could probably get a better pizza in the grocery store. He also asked me to not post a negative review because it would hurt his four children.
I would not recommend this pizza place."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Picked up 2 Chicago Deep Dish pizzas for lunch after a night on the town. 1 pizza was veggies, the other sausage, hot peppers, and mushrooms. Basically the taste of cheese dominated these pizzas with a seldom taste of topping -- a cheese bomb."

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Dined inside Rosati's for the first time on a Sunday night. I dined alone that night but craved pizza, so I opted for a calzone so I did not over-order. The mozzarella was deliciously gooey. The sausage stood out. I also ordered the calzone with fresh garlic and red onion which gave it a great balance.

My only regret about this visit is that I didn't get a deep dish pizza instead -- I get the impression that if their toppings are this great, their deep dish probably won't disappoint. Will be coming back again when I get a chance. Maybe with friends this time!"
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Well, I guess I have to up this review to four stars since I can't get enough of Rosati's Italian beef.  I have absolutely no idea how authentic it is, but since Rosati's is a Chicago-based chain, I'm guessing it's pretty close to the real deal.  Anyway, it's delicious, and the portions are extremely generous for what you pay (although the delivery charge still sucks).  

Also, thin crust pizza is the way to go here.  It's still pretty greasy, but not as bad as the thicker crusts.  The individual-size pizza is pretty big for just one person and at a good price."

It was very pleasant. Rosati's was busy the entire time we were there - there were always one or two groups waiting to be seated. Our server (Lindsey) was spectacular. We ordered a medium Chicago style pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onion, mushroom and black olive. It was much too much pizza - they are very generous with the toppings. The pizza was very good.

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Life's too short to eat mediocre pizza.  That pretty much sums up my feelings about Rosati's.  Stranded on the west side and in need of lunch, the WaunaQueen and I decided to give Rosati's a shot.  She ordered a slice of the pepperoni, I opted the Cheef sandwich, Italian Beef with covered with melted mozzarella cheese.

Both offerings were exceptionally mediocre.  The crust reminded me of what you get with a frozen pizza, dense, overly chewy and flavorless.  The sauce had that overcooked, right out of a can flavor.  The greasy cheese and pepperoni followed the exceedingly mediocre theme to a T.  To make matters worse, my wife's slice came out warm at best, so she had to have the kitchen put it in the oven to warm it up. 

The Italian Beef sandwich had little going for it in the flavor department, whether it be the spongy bread, the melted slab of chewy mozzarella cheese or the watery ju that accompanied the sandwich.  I appreciated the generous serving of beef, but man oh man, I'd trade less beef for more flavor.  The crinkle-cut fries came out warm and limp.

Service at the front counter was pleasant and efficient.  The person at the counter cheerfully greeted us as we entered the restaurant and granted our request for a side of feta cheese to go with my daughter slice of cheese pizza.  With a variety of lunch specials, you do not need to spend a fortune on your lunch here.  

The dining room could serve as a set for Goodfellas, with the Italian music wafting over the speakers, the red and white checked (plastic) tablecloths, elevated private booths and a minimal amount of sunlight filtering in though a small window.    The two big screens TVs detracted from the ambiance, but I did appreciate being able check the score of the World Cup match taking place that day.

On the downside, the ceaser salad was a few torn pieces of romaine, shred of parmesan, and a vinegar based ceaser dressing. Not good. No effort to actually make it a dish worth eating. For comparison Lou Malnatis makes an excellent ceaser salad. Also, free breadsticks with the pizza for the monday special were alright. Better than the salad but not worth buying if they ain't free although the marinara sauce tasted pretty good. A simple tomatoey marinara.

I stopped by this location since it was near my hotel and I learned they also served Italian Beef sammies, which are hard to find outside the Chicago area -- so they were getting my business after a 12 hour, no lunch work day.

Since I had to get an Italian Beef, I also got a thin crust personal pizza (it was my first meal all day, don't judge me!) , in hopes that their thin crust was better than my memories of their deep dish back in Chicago.

Only thing I ever that was remotely close was Bostonized, but that ain't Chicago - at least where I live. Used to the normal chains of Dominos, Pizza Hut, and the rest of them, but coming to a Chicago style pie joint is possibility made in heaven, I gotta say. After getting my pint of chocolate ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery relatively nearby, my Fitchburg friends and I stopped here at Rosati's for a delicious pie that could not be beat.

Located on Mineral Pointe Road in the heart of Fitchburg, there is no shortage of parking spaces here, unless you have come on prime time and need a space. Rosati's is within the Clock Tower shopping complex on Mineral Pointe road, nearby the Saigon Noodles I had been to the night before on Odana Road. Plenty of food choices out here. With that in mind, my friend and I ordered take out instead of dining in, so this review is just for the counter service and the food items we bought. I had ordered the 14"" Rosati Monster with the double stuffed crust, along with a side order of mozzarella sticks.

Let me tell you that I had thought about getting the 16"", but when that 14"" came out, that monster was crazy huge! And I thought I could have tanked a medium Pizza Hut pizza without any problems. I guess they don't call it the Rosati Monster for nothing! The pizza itself was a meaty cheesy monstrosity that could not be tamed in one sitting. I tried my best, but I could just manage half of it while saving myself for Cold Stone, which I took out 1/4 of it along with the mozzarella sticks before calling it a night. Guess ill be having the rest of it for breakfast and lunch sometime. The pizza itself was rather good and heavy, so that was a feast in itself. I really did enjoy myself with this pizza and hope to do it again soon. The mix of meaty and cheesy was so good, I guess that mixture is total bliss. And it was!

The counter service was ok at best. Everyone was moving around like it was crazy busy that night, but whatever works to get everyone's orders straight and make everyone happy and satisfied. They take credit cards, so that always awesome. That made me happy. They also have a dining area / restaurant, so that's nifty, if you choose to dine in here one of these days. Glad we phoned our order in, otherwise, we would have been waiting quite a long time for our order. Glad we made a pitstop at Cold Stone first before coming here. Overall, this plus is a serious recommend for sure. If you enjoy Chicago deep dish and Authentic made, this place is the one to go to. Just 3 hour drive northwest of Chicago, its pretty much the closest to the heart of Chicago if you are craving something from the source, but not willing to drive to the source. Rosati's is your best bet ever!

That being said, the crust is a little on the chewy side and the salads are very plain.  The service is average, everyone usually looks like they're in a big hurry but they always get our order to us without much fuss.  We give them steady business and have not yet had a bad experience."

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","I lived in or near Chicago for most of my life, and have frequented some of the best Chicago pizza restaurants in the Chicago area, including the original Pizzeria Uno (and Due), Lou Matti's and other more local favorites.  I used to deliver for a Rosati's franchise in the Chicago suburbs, and came to appreciate the finer points of this food genre while working there.

This Rosati's franchise is not the best I've seen, but it has improved greatly since I placed my first order there 4 years ago.  The variety of crust/pan choices is something that's unique to Rosati's.  The double dough and the ""Chicago style"" pan are my favorites.  Unlike some other local pizza places, they put the sauce all over the crust, and don't skimp on toppings.  Other favorites are the baked lasagna and chicken sandwich.

I'm a 100% delivery customer, and the drivers who bring my orders are great guys.  I tip them well and they never let me down.

Pluses: the variety of food choices for a pizza place:

Minuses: They close too early for my hours."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","We tried the Chicago style pizza and hot buffalo wings. Both were good, but neither was particularly noteworthy. The pizza had a very thick and somewhat doughy crust and a good amount of cheese and toppings. The sauce is a little on the bland side and the two pizzas I ordered both failed to travel particularly well even though it wasn't a terribly long drive home. The first small pizza was sausage and pepperoni and it was probably the better of the two. The sausage was somewhat on the bland side with very little in the way of savory or spicy flavor. That being said, the texture of the sausage was really good and the amount on the pizza was generous. The pepperoni was also pretty good, but not being on top of the pie during cooking means it doesn't brown up nicely and it gets a little lost. The other small pizza was veggie and it was also good, but somewhat on the bland side. The veggies give up a fair bit of liquid during cooking so this pizza did not hold together structurally as well as the other. The cheese on both was abundant but not exciting and lacked some of the amazing pull that comes on the very best pizzas. 

The wings were cooked nicely, although maybe one more minute in the fryer wouldn't have hurt. These wing are breaded then fried which makes them slightly heavier than non-breaded wings. The hot buffalo sauce was good, but again, nothing special. 

Rosati's was good pizza and I would be curious to try their thin crust options, but there are much better options in Madison and incomparably better options in Chicago. I also thought it was a little silly to be charged $0.53 for a side of hot giardinaire on a $48 order of two small pizzas and wings. Not the end of the world by any means, but still a little lackluster."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Just about as perfect as a Chicago-style pizza can get. Their sauce was excellent, and their crust is superb! Sauce on top, just like it should be, piled with loads of toppings and cheese!

Service was ok - she kept my drink filled. They only had one server though, and they got busy quickly, so she was very frantic and all over the place.

Appetizer sampler was ok, but nothing to write home about."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","This pizza place has a lot of good things going for it! My work recently catered in lunch and I was able to sample some of their thin crust pizza offerings. 

My initial thought was ""this is not thin crust"" - but when I think thin, I think cracker thin. That being said a cracker crust would never hold-up to the glorious amount of stretchy cheese and toppings that are present in every bite - so gooey! 

The establishment remains true to its claim of authentic ""Chicago"" style with hand-crafted Italian sausage present on many items. I tried the Godfather and I really like the addition of giardiniera and this was far and away my favorite specialty pizza. The sauce was good - not too sweet - and portioned out mildly enough not to over power the bite.

Overall it's good pizza and worth the extra couple of dollars for something far more substantial then your average chain!"

Two waitresses and only one table occupied.  Despite being only five feet from them, neither bothered to acknowledge me or ask if I wanted to sit down. They were too busy talking and deciding which CD to play. After waiting for a time, I walked out.  I couldn't believe how rude they were."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","By far, the best pizza pies in Madison. Their crust and sauces are exceptional. This Italian joint is decidedly old school. Cheese is spread and calories and fat phobes are not spared. 

Much of the staff is young, but are all friendly enough. However, you don't come here too feed your ego ... just your face. 

Rosati's has a massive menu, but you cannot go wrong with any of it. In fact, if you order their sensational Italian sausage, you can't help but go right.

That is until I tried Rosati's.  I am not looking for authentic, I don't know if this real Chicago fare but I do like how it tastes.

I would go five stars, but this weekend my wife ordered the ""double dough"" pizza and I tried it - pretty disapointingly dry bland crust.

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","As a transplant from Chicago, one of the most difficult adjustments to Madison life has been the lack of quality pizza.  It boggles my mind that we are in such a vast wasteland when it comes to pizza!  And to find a dine in pizza place with decent offering is even more difficult.  I grew up on thin crust Chicago style. Rosati ' s has the best I've come across in my search for a taste of home. They use cheese that tastes like cheese., and Chicago style Italian sausage.  I do recommend ordering the thin ""double crust"" as the standard is too thin and cracker - like. 

Atmosphere is okay.  I wish I didn't have to listen to continuous Frank Sinatra every time for the entire duration of the meal.

Customer service was minimal.  I'm not one to expect the server to carry on long conversation.  But when they ask how we're enjoying the meal, it would be nice if they, at least, pretended as if they were listening /cared. 

Value is about what I expect for a dine in pizza.  Sixteen inch double crust sausage and bacon (we always get more than necessary to have leftovers.) Was about  $21.

Definitely a favorite when our stomachs are missing home. (I would give 3.5 stars of Yelp allowed.)"

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Really disappointed in the regular, large, pepperoni pizza.

I live near their Mineral Point location and since I can't seem to find a decent Italian spot, much less a pizza, in Madison..... I tried Rosati's.

This is my 2nd time ordering a pizza from them.  The first time they burnt it so when we ate it all we tasted was a char taste. Well, this one wasn't burnt, but instead of tasting the burnt taste, I tasted the sauce. Which tasted like Spaghettio sauce. Not a whole lot of cheese on there. The crust was thinner than I expected as I didn't order a ""thin crust"", just regular... *shrug* 

My husband and I both had a ""WTF"" moment and said that it tasted like a Tombstone. Then I said, ""Not even a Tombstone! Maybe a Jack's frozen pizza!"" Literally had me wishing I didn't waste $16 on this.

The 2nd star comes from the Italian Beef they have there. They are really good, and huge portion for the price. Wishing I would have ordered that instead of the pizza."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Rosati's is my favorite pizza in the Madison area.  There's something magical about the sauce, cheese, and their italian sausage (we roll simple in my household)...  Very few pizzas give me that satisfying ""hunger quenching"" feeling that Rosati's gives me.  Unfortunately, that leads to the problem of not knowing when to stop!  But that's my problem, not theirs...

I've carried out for lunch as well as ate in with the family.  I've never been disappointed!  The kids love it.  I love it.  My extended family loves it.  It's awesome.  The grab-and-go lunch options are nice too (I work nearby)."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","This is our go to pizza place when we want food delivered right to our door or my husband wants to do a quick carryout. We live a few miles down the road and we normally wait between 45 minutes to an hour for deliveries, but only around 20 minutes for carryout. 

I would say 90% of the time we get this, our food is great for a chain pizza joint. We prefer it much more over Dominos or Pizza Hut. The few times our food is sub par is usually when we order food that isn't pizza. The last couple of times, for example, we ordered jalapeño poppers as a side and when they showed up, all of the breading had fallen off inside the box. There have been other times, however, where they come perfectly fine. I think it depends on the day.

The staff have always been very friendly, but we have never actually sat down to eat inside the restaurant so I cannot comment as to the environment. It always seems clean when we are waiting in line for our carryout orders. The delivery staff is always extremely friendly. They even delivered to our specific hotel room a couple of times when my apartment had flooded and I had to move out for repairs.

Overall, if you are looking for some decent pizza at a fairly cheap price (for the Madison area), this is a good place!"
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","I've been here before, and again, it has surpassed my expectations and has always delivered (no pun intended).  I usually only get delivery and that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour, but it's worth the wait.  This time I ordered a stuffed crust pizza - I was expecting more of a sandwich/calzone stuffed pizza, but they basically have cheese and toppings between two layers of crust and then the sauce on the top.  Still pretty delicious, but a lot like Chicago for me, which is not a bad thing. 

Also, I ordered a small batch of wings (spicy garlic) and they were delicious.  It is hard to find good wings from restaurants that don't feature them, but they did a great job!

I usually get their italian beef sandwiches, and they have always been seasoned well and you can get a small cup of au jus on the side for pretty cheap (and you don't necessarily need it).  All in all, their pizza and side items are delicious.  It's also nice to support local rather than do the national chain restaurants."

Had done so a few times over the past for delivery and   had no problems with their sandwiches and the service was decent enough to consider okay... Clearly was not trying to get anything for free seeing as I called simply as courtesy call letting them know to cook the pizza slightly longer.. its also so close to me about a block away.. the pizza was not done at all the middle was extremely doughy and probably needed to be in the oven for just over another 5 minutes. The person I asked to talk to was apparently the manager or supposedly I should say. Really wondering who trained him because basically argued with me over five minutes  without hearing anything I had to say. conversation on his end was clearly unintelligent.. Felt like I was talking to a child throwing a fit to get his way with no argument. Again wasn't trying to get anything for free was just stating the fact that their pizza was not done... In the midst of a general manager: arguing with me I decided to end the conversation with a"" I will no longer ever order a single thing from this restaurant again ""and he was okay with it!!!...  For them it sucks.. Try Cafe la bellitalia or portabella"
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Amazing place. I'm often too hungry to be patient here, but am never disappointed.
Knowing how good the food is, it's VERY hard to be patient... And some days we've had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. But it was well worth it, I think. Have never been able to finish an order from here (portions are VERY generous)... Great leftovers! Their pasta is amazing and their pizza is one of the best in town.

I've only dined in, never carried out. The dining room isn't huge, but you won't feel like you're suffocating. The lighting is a little dim, and they often have Dean Martin playing in the background. Flat screens at every corner, I believe-- you'll never miss a game or breaking news! Ha!

The service is almost always good. The servers are always very nice.

First time writing a review for this place (and in general), but I will be sure to add any more info if necessary.

Definitely a place to go, any time of the week! You won't regret it!"
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","I ordered from Rosati's for the first time in a couple years and the pizza is still just fine (this time I went for The Veggie) but what I really wanted were good breadsticks. I'd never tried theirs, but figured since they had decent crust, a decent breadstick would follow. Unfortunately, logic failed me in this department. 

The price of the breadsticks on the menu were cheap ($2.99), and the quality followed suit. I'm convinced that they are not made in-house, as they were extremely bland and had that spongy, white-bread quality you'd find in a plastic-wrapped package you'd pick up in the grocery store. Another menu item, Nuggets, are billed as pieces of crispy pizza dough tossed in garlic butter sauce. Those go for $6.49, and should have tipped me off that the breadsticks were probably not the best choice. 

The upside in the long run is that I'll have consumed less bread, but giving me SyscoStix (my own name that I wouldn't be at all surprised to find is a real product) instead of just cutting up some pizza dough was a star-dropping move. What else can't they be bothered to make?"
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","I thought the pizza was okay, but not spectacular. I probably won't return."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","I'll judge Rosati's by what they claim to be: an ""Authentic Chicago"" restaurant featuring pizza, italian beef, and hot dogs. I think they did a very mediocre impression of Chicago's classic food. 

The thin crust pizza was my favorite: pretty crunchy crust with flavorful sauce and enough cheese (nothing too much but it was at least more than a national chain like Papa Johns. The toppings weren't as plentiful as I'd like. Each slice had two or three pepperoni pieces with a couple sausage bits. I thought the taste reminded me of a Chicago thin crust pizza but was not up to its level. 

For the Italian beef, it was not comparable at all. Very below-average. Flavorless without copious amounts of either Au jus or giardiniera. The french roll was too soft and had no exterior crisp to it. 

The prices are a tad high, but for a place that calls itself a specialty restaurant they are what you'd expect. Service is pretty fast and friendly. Overall three stars sums it up: Mediocre."
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Ordered for delivery to work today with a group of folks. I can't speak on the topic of their pizzas, but as for my portion of the order...

First, the price quoted for a personal pizza over the phone was higher than stated on the menu on the website. As well, my portion of the order was charged a separate delivery charge from the main order - though it was all delivered together. 

Second, the garlic bread was burnt, tough, and gross. Even if you were willing to handle the texture and crumbling bread, you could taste burnt garlic, not just burnt bread. We threw it away. 

Third, the personal pan pizza (cheese with pineapple). I've had better pizza at various fastfood chains that don't claim to be ""authentic Chicago pizza"". The sauce especially - yuck. As stated in other reviews, extremely greasy and messy. 

If you want good pizza in Madison, go to Ian's."

Huge portions of spaghetti come with my favorite dish, the chicken parm. Excellent garlic bread flanks two chicken breasts, with marinara that is on the sweet side (which I prefer).

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that the service can be a little slow for drink refills. I've occasionally had to stop eating for a few minutes until I could wash some of the food down after a drink refill. The slower things are, the more likely it seems to happen."

They use yummy Vienna Beef dogs (of course), topped with the usual condiments.

First time ordering through Rosati's.  I'm tired of pizza, so I thought I'd try to mix it up a bit and get a sandwich and some sides: meatball parm, garlic wings, and cheese fries.

The delivery went OK, no complaints there.  The delivery charge was reasonable (about half that of most folks on Grubhub) and the timing was decent.  The food, however was an absolute travesty.

- SO MUCH SALT.  I was unable to finish a single dish because everything was drenched in salt.  The bread, the cheese, the meatballs.... all one big briny mess.  

- The cheese on the sandwich was felt plasticky and tasteless.  I'm pretty sure the cheese on the cheese fries came out of a can.  Maybe I expected too much from a restaurant in Wisconsin (I didn't realize Rosati's was a chain.  I was thinking more along the lines of AJ's in Verona), but I always expect the cheese to be good, at least.

- The garlic bread was hard instead of crispy, salty instead of garlicky.

- The one positive was that that the Diet Coke was cold.

So, in the future... no.  Maybe I just got a bad sample, but it was bad enough that I'm not going to give it another shot."

Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza","Being a recovering former Flatlander I was well familiar with Rosati's before I moved to Madison. Having gone to several of them around Chicago I've found there to be a lot of variation from individual restaurant in the chain. I just wanted to make that clear so I identified that it was this specific Rosati's I was talking about.

Anyhow! I've ordered pizza from them a half a dozen times in a couple of years and have dined in once. They are my Go-To for ""as-near-to-real-Chicago-style-as-I-can-get"" pizza in Madison and they do it well. The crust is perfectly crisped, the cheese thick as it should be, and the toppings generous. They have a well seasoned sausage that I just love. I will note that when I order from them I *do* ask for less sauce on top as they have occasionally gone wild with it (and sauce gone wild just is nothing anyone should have to deal with).

Anyhow -- I've had other things from them as well and I have to say their pasta has not wowed me but it is pretty good. Their biggest weakness seems to be their sauce; It just needs more flavor or at least a stronger flavor. 

For the bread lover you'll want to hit up the Nuggets but don't do it alone. If you think these are a side order for one person you will find yourself awash in a tide of deliciously fried, lightly sauced goodness that your heart may not recover from. 

The service when I had dined in was good; I didn't go long without a refill and they checked in often enough that we knew they were watching but not so often that it was obnoxious. There was a little delay before we ordered but that can happen when it gets busy so I am not about to begrudge them that.

Their Chicago-style really is the closest to downtown Chicago I've had since I've been up here and that alone will keep me coming back indefinitely... or at least until Gino's or Giordano's crawl their way up I-90."

I was over joyed to find that there was a Rosatis near me. So I figured I would give them a try. I ordered a 12 inch Chicago Deep Dish. The staff was very helpful with me picking out my size so I did not over order. When the pizza got here I couldn't was to dig in. It looked amazing. They must use some butter in the crust. It was the best Chicago pizza I have had in a long time. I will definitely be ordering from here a lot!!  I give them five stars cause there wasn't ten!!
Rosati's Pizza,"9"" chicago style gluten-free pizza",Good food. Good service. I like spicy Italian beef on garlic bread and their stuffed pizza (buttery crust). 4 stars.
A8 China,k2. chicken with mixed vegetables,"Food wasn't bad, but the portion sizes were off (for delivery, at least). My entrée was basic sesame chicken, with a side of rice. The chicken and rice came together, meaning that the bottom 3/4 of my container was rice while the surface layer was chicken. I finished the chicken in what seemed like a moment. Obviously an attempt to save money on their part, but not what I'm looking for."

one pork egg roll or order of crab rangoon

steamed or fried rice

I had hunan chicken which featured large pieces of white meat chicken, no gristle, lots of seemingly fresh veggies (broccoli, peppers, onion, etc.), and a nicely spiced and not too sweet sauce. The fried rice was yellow and nothing spectacular. It's a great deal for takeout. The small filled me up (and I have a big appetite for Chinese takeout!)
I haven't experienced any customer service problems, but while I was there waiting for my food, there were two other guys waiting. One had ordered a small special with general tso's and one had ordered a large general tso's. They called out ""one kung pao chicken"" and it seemed like it could have turned into a big debacle, but the guys who wanted general tso's corrected them and the guys behind the counter promptly brought them their correct orders. 
I did appreciate the health department's ""symptoms of norovirus"" flier posted on the soda refrigerator..."
A8 China,k2. chicken with mixed vegetables,"Cheap, but bad. The store itself looks really second rate and the rice I got was dry and aged. The chicken was dry and the sauce looked really artificially colored. Very cheap lunch though if you don't mind eating a little worse"
A8 China,k2. chicken with mixed vegetables,"For the price it's pretty good, and the vegetables are fresh seeming which is more than I can say for most Chinese places. I got a $7 meal with crab Rangoon, fried rice, general tsoas chicken and a fortune cookie, good deal"
A8 China,k2. chicken with mixed vegetables,"Personally, I love A8 China. It's been my go-to fast food place since a few years back when I started attending college here. They've always had less than $6 lunch meals, but they have deteriorated in size. (I don't mind. I could stand to eat less haha)

It has the best General Tso's Chicken hands down: sweet and tangy. Asian Kitchen's is usually tough and dry. The crab rangoon here is slightly sweet and damn tasty.

Another thing definitely worth noting: I've eaten there on several occasions and Chinese students frequent it as a popular hangout. It makes sense to me because they actually make some delicious Chinese (non-gwailo) food.

I don't know what all these 1 star reviews are about. No offense, but I'm assuming most of these people have never had real Chinese food (basically not that deep fried, sauce slathered, stuff everyone associates with) since half of my mom is a 1st generation immigrant from Hong Kong. I feel A8 is a more tasty representation than other fast food Chinese I've had in Madison."
A8 China,k2. chicken with mixed vegetables,"A8 China is located near my building and I've gone there several times for carry out. The first visit went relatively well - I ordered my food, waited for roughly 10 minutes and was served quite an average plate of General Tso's Chicken. The chicken was lacking in flavor and texturally unimpressive but my egg roll and fried rice were decent.

NOW, a few months pass and I decide to return on a lazy sunday evening, and I experience some of the worst service and food of my time in Madison. The restaurant was not ridiculously busy and seemed well-staffed for a Sunday night, but it took 25 minutes for my one serving of Lo Mein to arrive. During the waiting period, I asked the cashier when I should expect it and she looked confused and seemed to shout back to the cook, correcting the original order. Not good! Although she repeated my order back to me at checkout, I figured that they probably started making something else and had to restart. Worse things have happened, and I figured, if the food was good, I'd be alright with it. On a side note, another bad sign was the lady in the store who was waiting to return a full bag of food she'd ordered earlier!

Anyways, my food finally came and, upon returning home, I encountered a horrendously bland, over-oiled Lo Mein with dry, flaky fried rice. The only redeeming feature of the dish was the crab rangoon, which was pleasantly sweet and tasty!

Needless to say, I will not be returning to A8 China anytime soon due to my experience with both poor service and food. For better Chinese in Madison, I'd recommend Asian Kitchen or QQ. I don't mind walking a bit further for an equally priced Chinese dish that's infinitely better than what A8 serves!"
A8 China,k2. chicken with mixed vegetables,"Absolutely no and never again. First of all, $9.98 for chicken lomein that's half oil and half soy sauce? I could barely pick up the noodles with my chopsticks because they were covered in oil. No thanks.

But the main reason this place gets one star (and less if I had the option) is that there is no soap in the bathroom. I went to wash my hands before I ate, and I noticed that there was no more soap; therefore, I did the courteous thing and asked the female cook that there was none, and she told me that they had no more! What restaurant doesn't carry a backup of soap?! I'm assuming the men's room didn't have any either, which means that every time the cooks used the bathroom, they didn't clean their hands! I gagged. Any restaurant that doesn't even stock the most basic way of cleaning your hands is disgusting.

Dirty hands, oily noodles, and inflated prices for unsanitary and just flat out bad food. No thanks."

A8 China,9. chinese donuts,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, they're cheap and they're timely with the deliveries. The food's really standard Americanized Chinese fare and it tastes pretty decent -- It's pretty much a not-so-greasy/non-greasy alternative to Asian Kitchen and I personally find them a bit better tasting than Asian Kitchen in general."
A8 China,9. chinese donuts,"Not the best quality, but a good bang for your buck.  Standard chinese options at hefty portions. Not sure if this is still open late nights, however good to have after bar hours on State Street. One of two Chinese takeout spots within walking distance on campus."
A8 China,9. chinese donuts,"I'm very satisfied with the food for the price. It's not crazy greasy, you get a very filling portion and it's inexpensive.

If you're looking for cheap Chinese, go to A8."
A8 China,9. chinese donuts,"My first visit was pretty satisfying. No mistakes, no long wait, the food pretty good and less greasy, the lady speaking Chinese was shy but polite and patient, explaining to be the ingredients.

I was sick of bad service in local Chinese restaurants in Madison and wishing to go some place that's just easy and quick and not too expensive. I was by myself and plaecs with service kinda made me uncomfortable. I therefore ventured in this little, not attractive looking eatery and gave it a try, ready to be underwhelmed. It turned out much better than I expected.

People order and pay in cashier, no tips, and they bring food to your table. It was Sunday afternoon and the place had quite some business. Everyone in the store was Chinese or Asian students. 

Cashier speaks English and Chinese, so no problem with language.  You choose your own seat and it too very little time for my food to arrive. My biggest concern was the food might be greasy, but it was not bad. They even have the diet version, cooked without oil.

I grow up in Asia and am so used to street food, where eating is really all about food and you will be left alone(which is great now because I'm so sick of answering""I'm fine"" 5 times when servers come ask you is everything ok).  Street food is quick and easy. There isn't much service involved, but of course owners won't just treat you rudely. I was happy with this place because it feels like places I visit where I grow up.

I read reviews on this place and was well aware of my experience contradicting with mainstream.  If you are American you probably would consider this place pretty bad, but if you have lived in China or HK or Taiwan you probably won't take it so personally.  It simply shows you a Chinese side of service and food experience.

My slight complaint is, they charge you 50 cent extra if you pay by card, but there's a sign indicating this. Also, in Chinese minimum charge for card payment is 10, but in English it is 20. That feels tricky."
A8 China,9. chinese donuts,"Was told this was really authentic Chinese food.  I'm not judge of oriental authenticity... but I can tell you: I did not enjoy the food.  Lots of grissle and fat.  Kind of gross.  The sauces were a little bland.

My ex bought a copy of Legend of Zelda with the gold cartridge from this place, though.  Tell me that that's something you look for in a Chinese food restaurant."
A8 China,9. chinese donuts,"For quick order Chinese food A8 is pretty standard. At some times they have very inexpensive lunch specials. The dinner prices are a tad bit higher (although still reasonable). It's a bit more spacious than Asian Kitchen if you want to eat your meal on the spot (just as often, though, I ordered to take home). Other than that, not much else to say about it."
A8 China,9. chinese donuts,"When you are looking for standard Chinese food, this is a good option.  I usually order from this place during lunch and delivery if fast.  I ordered this time during dinner through Yelp.  The delivery exceeded the 45-60 minutes by 25 minutes.  So I will think twice about using Eat Street delivery again.

But the food I ordered was good and there was a lot of it.  Enough for three meals.  So yeah I still like them."

I don't mind walking a bit further for an equally priced Chinese dish that's infinitely better than what A8 serves!"
A8 China,c20. chicken with vegetables lunch combination,"Absolutely no and never again. First of all, $9.98 for chicken lomein that's half oil and half soy sauce? I could barely pick up the noodles with my chopsticks because they were covered in oil. No thanks.

But the main reason this place gets one star (and less if I had the option) is that there is no soap in the bathroom. I went to wash my hands before I ate, and I noticed that there was no more soap; therefore, I did the courteous thing and asked the female cook that there was none, and she told me that they had no more! What restaurant doesn't carry a backup of soap?! I'm assuming the men's room didn't have any either, which means that every time the cooks used the bathroom, they didn't clean their hands! I gagged. Any restaurant that doesn't even stock the most basic way of cleaning your hands is disgusting.

Dirty hands, oily noodles, and inflated prices for unsanitary and just flat out bad food. No thanks."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I have to say, the menu at Fugu looks pretty similar to the menu at Ichiban. My boyfriend and I ordered the garlic eggplant and the baby octopus with pickled peppers from the house specials. We both loved the octopus dish, which was savory and spicy. The garlic eggplant was a bit on the oily side, with a one-dimensional flavor. We were also seated near an air vent, and it felt too hot the whole time we were there. 5 stars for the octopus, 2 stars for the eggplant, and 1 star for the heating situation."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"If I were to name three restaurants in Madison I can't live without, Fugu would be one of them!  Pleasant ambiance, good service and DELICIOUS food! 

Their 'pork dumplings' are undoubtedly the best I have ever had. And the taste is consistent no matter what time of the day. I would strongly recommend their 'Chicken with spicy and sour Garlic sauce'. It is unlike any Chinese Chicken dish I have ever had in or outside Madison. Their fried fish is also very delicious.

A must-try for even someone who does not like chinese food. You might just change your mind after going to Fugu!"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"A group of friends and I came here after a day of snowboarding craving some spicy food. This place is by far the most authentic Szechuan restaurant I've been to. I'm not joking, Fugu would seriously destroy other Chinese restaurants if they decide to move to Chicago Chinatown. 

We ordered 2 cold appetizers and 5 entrees for 5 of us. I'm not sure if the waiting was truly long,  or we just felt like it because we were in a room full of spicy aroma. But once they started serving the dishes, it was really fast, we had all our 7 plates in 10min. We started with two very traditional dishes, pepper shredded tripe and ox tongue and tripe, which I always use to test the authenticity of a Szechuan restaurant. Fugu definitely passed my test. Everyone suddenly stopped talking and quietly enjoyed the texture and the flavor. 

The house-special steamed lamb pot was really good and I also loved the crispy chili (haven't had it for years and I found it here!). I was a little bit disappointed with the poached beef, fish with pickled chili and spicy aromatic pig blood tofu. They were good, but they just didn't meet the high expectations I built up after the cold appetizers and first two dishes. I can't explain what was it, but there was something missing in their flavor, maybe it needs to a little bit more complexity of spicy and sour? 

The waiter was very friendly and he asked for our suggestions and even apologized for ""letting us down"" with some of the dishes. I gave Fugu a solid 4 stars and I will definitely revisit this place. If you love authentic Chinese food, Fugu is the place to go!"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"4 stars for one of two most authentic Chinese restaurants in town!
4 stars for the only Chinese restaurant specializing in Sezchuan foods.
5 stars for the o-so-spicy-it-makes-your-mouth-drooling-and-your-eyes-teary spicy fried chicken (other recommended menu includes tofu and mushroom in white sauce, spicy dandan noodle, and spicy wonton)
3 stars for the fish with spicy sauce, cold tripe/tendon.
3 stars for the relatively expensive price"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This is the beginning of a new love affair. A Chinese coworker brought me here after work last week stating this is the most authentic in Madison, and after scanning through their menu which included kidneys and intestines, I was beginning to feel a bit giddy. 

The flavor in my Lao Gan Ma twice cooked pork tasted just like the ones I've had in Chinatowns and I've visited ALL the chinatowns in this country. I loved the sauce so much that I poured my rice into the plate at the end and gobbled up every last drop of that delicious greasiness. 

The only complaint I have is their dining room being too dark and too cold. I mean, the food really isn't SO spicy that you would feel the need for icy air to cool down. So minus one star for ambience. 

I will be back. Possibly tomorrow and every week after."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Fugu is among the top two Chinese restaurants in Madison serving authentic, family-style Chinese cuisine. A bit heavy handed with the salt and msg, but of course this means the food was good. I was delighted that one of their seasonal vegetable options was Water Spinach / Ong Choy / Kong Xin Cai. The stir-fried thick rice noodles with chicken was also a good bet.

Like other Chinese/Asian fusion restaurants in Madison, Fugu is undergoing an identity crisis. Rather than serving a cohesive selection of items, I imagine this place developed its concept by catering to the whim of its customers. I guess business is business. 

Our waiter was charming and patient when trying to explain some of the difficult-to-translate menu items. 

The price point is high for home-cooked Chinese food, but I'm learning to expect this of State St. establishments."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,The most authentic Chinese food in Madison! I have searched long and hard for the food I learned to love when I lived in China 10 years ago and Fugu delivers. Must haves are the spicy twice cooked sliced pork ( pork belly) and the sezchaun spicy wontons... Enjoy
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Normally not a fan of Chinese, this was much better than most I've had. (And that's a compliment coming from me).  This place was bustling at 7:30pm on a Friday night but our carryout order was on time.  I was lucky enough to have someone with me so we could double-park, otherwise you may struggle to pick up your food as this is right off of State St.

I ordered the veggies & shittake mushroom (added tofu, a girl needs her protein, for $1,50).  Glad I did as the ""veggies"" otherwise were simply bok choy and shittakes.   The veggies were plump, flavorful, and fresh. The tofu was lightly fried and not too greasy. The sauce wasn't too heavy but also was on the bland side, it could have used a bit more flavor (not spice, I'm talkin' flavor here),  The Kung Pao chicken got rave reviews at our house for being delicious and not too greasy (take note other Chinese restaurants, you're tooooo greeeeeeasy).  The steamed veggie dumplings ($4.50) were perfectly fine, but nothing I'd write home about.  

All in all, if we were to order Chinese carryout again, this would be the place."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Having read an article about Fugu in either Madison Magazine or Madison Originals, I was very excited to try an authentic restaurant. 

And yet sadly, Fugu disappoints. The interior ambiance is fine... nothing special, but decent. 

The food I had was just disappointing. On my first visit, I tried an order of the pan-fried noodles, which I had expected to be crispy. They were not even close to what I had come to expect from Chicago's Chinatown. This might have been ok if they weren't also unbearably garlicky and salty, so much so that no amount of water would have satiated the thirst I got from eating the meal. My husband fared slightly better with the pad thai lunch box, but he wasn't a huge fan, either. On my second visit, I tried a Massaman curry lunch box. I was much happier with this option, as the flavors were good, and the vegetables included were some of my favorites. However, when I actually put the curry sauce on my rice (rather than just pulling the veggies out of the sauce), I realized that the sauce had a gritty/sandy texture that was quite unpleasant on my teeth. 

Most importantly, the service was extremely slow. My second visit was over lunch on a work day, and we couldn't even catch the waitress' eye to get more water or anything else we needed. After a good 35-45 minutes of no attention whatsoever, we had to head back to work. Thankfully, we had cash, so without ever receiving the check, we were able to leave the appropriate amount of money on the table and leave. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"As far as Chinese food goes, this is the best in Madison, which is why it gets 5 stars.  The only other comparable location is Ichiban Szechuan, and that restaurant is more oily and less flavorful.

The style here is mostly from southern China--most dishes are spicy, and there are very few vegetarian options (though the vegetarian options are delicious as well).

One thing to note is that their 'hotpot' dishes aren't what you'd expect of 'huo guo'.  These are mostly dry dishes kept heated over a flame.  Worth a try if you're curious.

They have 'Americanized' menu items which tend to be a little too sweet.  I would recommend getting anything with a Chinese name next to it. 

Items I usually get:
Mapo Tofu
Spicy twice cooked fish
Cumin lamb
Hot and sour soup

The service is usually fast, but can be slow on busier days."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This place has the spicy Chinese food i've been craving for. They got some American Chinese food but mostly true authentic Chinese food you don't see much. This is the only reason you should go here for and order. I bet most people are brained washed thinking that Chinese buffet restaurants are true Chinese food. The young unwise me was once.

When I first arrived I had to wait out front alone for a few minutes before someone finally came out of the kitchen. Put after that service was on. Friendly and helpful. Their was only one other couple in the place the whole time I was there on a Monday night.

They have two menu ""books"". Took me awhile to figure out what to order even thou I had looked over their menu online a little bit.

First dish to arrive was the Spicy Green Beans. Crisps bite with slices of garlic and chucks of dry chilies. Greasier than I would of liked. Huge pool of oil on the bottom of plate. Had a kick to it but nothing compared to the next dish. The Mapo Tofu. Mouth on fire, nose running, the way I like it good. Chili oil, minced pork, scallions, szechuan pepper, and tofu. Hard to eat with chopsticks. The side of rice was excellent to soak up all the liquid.
 
No buffet here. But great place to get a group of friends together and order a huge amount of plates to get a wide tasting of their menu."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Fugu has been one of my bigger disappointments in Madison dining, because i've heard both my friend and yelp peers give big ups to it, but my experiences here have really failed to meet expectations. All of the times i've been here, i've noticed two trends: Bland entrees, and slow service.

With regard to the entrees: Some reviews on here are claiming that some of the dishes are great, so maybe i'm just ordering the wrong things. But, I got a mushroom dish, and an assortment of veggie dishes, and all of those left a lot to be desired. The mushroom dish had some spice, but the mushroom texture was inconsistent, so it wasn't too great. The veggies were often just the veggie in question with some rice, sometimes in a tasteless sauce. It didn't feel like anything that I couldn't have made at home easily.

As for the service, it's just often really slow. Slow for them to seat you, slow to take your order, slow for them to fill up your water (which really sucks if you get a spicy dish and you're a spice wimp like myself), and slow for them to get your bill. I went at times that were only semi-crowded, but regardless it didn't seem like it should have been taking so long. They could benefit from adding another wait staff to take orders at peak hours.

My experience as Fugu hasn't been all bad, though. Note that I only mentioned the entrees being bland. I've had some pretty excellent appetizers, such as the Sesame cakes, which came with a very awesome savory sauce. I'd definitely be willing to try Fugu again, but only if I had a lot of free time that night, and a very good tip from someone on what to order."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My fiance loves this place to death. I have tried about 10 dishes here in hopes of finding one that I will like enough to be happy when he wants to order Fugu instead of switching into clever-ploys-to-do-something-other-than-Fugu mode.

I can't put my finger on it, exactly, but everything seems to be too much or too little of too many things. Too spicy, too greasy, too bland, too many bones I have to pick out. It's like that dish that you cook for yourself at home and when you go to taste it you think oh dang, this isn't very good but I made it so I might as well eat it. But you don't really want to feel that way about takeout that you get all the time, you know?"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This was probably the worst Chinese food we've ever had. We ordered mango smoothie, wonton soup, kung pao chicken, and general Taos chicken.  Generals was so battered and friend we couldn't find the chicken inside. And the Kung pao was fried, which never happens; it's typically grilled. So we ordered a 3rd meal, another chicken dish and I was the worst quality of meat ever. We left completely disappointed and $50 down the drain."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I've been here several times, mostly it was ok, but sometimes there's no service.
Or the service you got is their stare.

2 things I don't like about this place is,

--I like/cook Chinese food, but when dining out, its oily feature always concerns me.  I therefore have to use extra 2 bowls for getting rid of excessive oil/salt, otherwise my body can't take it.
I got stares several times. Even more when I asked the 2nd bowl, having to walk over to the counter while waitress chatting, 5 people in the restaurant.
--I like seafood but the fish with tofu in spicy sauce is not fresh at all. I live in coastal area before so could tell the difference very well. The fish they use is definitely frozen ones.  15.95 for frozen fish doesn't get my business.

Having said that, it's pretty good flavor with most dishes we try, and relatively inexpensive. In terms of service, how would I say? It's just a very Chinese way, meaning if you say thank you to them they ignore you.  Having have to go to the counter to pay yourself. We've lived in HK before and literally got shoutings from them so know what it's like (but of course never like it). Guess in Chinese culture restaurant is about food, not service.

Last time I paid tips with lower percentage. The lady looked kinda disappointed. Hey, same here. How do I know the tips go to people serving me?"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I ended up going twice in a week.  Interesting mix of Chinese-American and ""real"" Szechuan.  You get two menus, one of which is really large.  Huge variety of food to choose from.

On the first visit, I went with a vegetarian friend and there were lots of options for her.  After reading reviews, we ordered the sesame pancakes, which were good, but they were like deep fried roti with sesame on them.  They didn't taste very Chinese-y but were tasty.  Greasy but tasty.

We shared the Ma Po tofu and still didn't finish it all - really good dish - spicy (not too much) and a lot of flavor.

On my second trip I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, recommended by another friend.  The waitress asked which one I wanted - there was an American-Chinese style and a Szechuan version.  I got the Szechuan version.  You know those red chili peppers in a lot of spicy Chinese dishes?  There were a ton and chopped up so if you don't like eating them (like me, I love them in the food for flavor but they give me massive heartburn), you have to pick out a lot of them.  The chicken was deliciously cooked - perfectly tender and also had slices of garlic and I think some ginger.  Of course, there was a generous supply of peanuts.

They also have some interesting dishes like fried spicy intestines that I wanted to try but wimped out."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Yum.  In town visiting a friend and came here by chance, I ordered the pan fried noodles (asked for them to be spicy!) and my friend ordered the kung pao chicken. We both loved our food, and my friend has decided to definitely come here more often now! FYI that the pop comes in cans."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My coworker and I found this on Yelp while in town on a client trip. I had been specifically looking for a great Thai option. We have some thai in Iowa City (one pretty good one) but I figured there'd be something outstanding in Madison. We were not disappointed. I have eaten thai from sea to shining sea and I honestly thing\k the masaman sauce here was the best I have ever had. Modest interior - nice/chintzy-casual, accessible and obviously in a student area. Coldplay's latest album rotated twice while we were there which added to the experience for me. Good prices. And, again, really really good. I left with the ""thai glow."" :-)"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Fugu has been my ""go to"" for ""authentic"" Chinese food for a while but I do have some complaints.

The boiled beef is traditionally supposed to come in a spicy broth but at Fugu, it comes with a syrupy, spicy sauce. It tasted fine but it wasn't what I was expecting, especially since I know that I've had the authentic version here in the past. When I mentioned it to my waitress, she just told me that the brothy version is what they do in China, but at Fugu, this syrupy, saucy dish is how they make it.

Other than that, the food is fine. It's actually pretty good. The prices are definitely steeper than some of the other Chinese places around State but if you're looking for good ""authentic"" Chinese food at a sit down restaurant, Fugu is your still best choice."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Ah, what can I say. Seems like a very popular option amongst international UW Chinese students who wants a taste of home, as it is in a very convenient location and the food quality is as authentic as it gets here in Madison.

Food - on our visit, we had the ox tripe and tongue appetizer along with sliced chicken in garlic sauce (classic Chinese dish but replacing pork with chicken) and shredded pork in bean sauce. Food was great but we should've went with a veggie dish instead of meat on top of meat. Spiciness is my thing and this place quenched my desire for spicy Chinese food. 

Service - compared to the food, service is lacking. After we were seated  no waiters came to our table for the next 15 minutes. I had to tell the person up front that we're still waiting to order. After we were finished, it took another 10-15 to give us the check, we were thinking of just walking out without paying :P

Price - if you're really desperate to eat authentic Chinese, the price isn't a factor. But compared to most Chinese eateries, this is definitely on the pricier side. For 1 appetizer and 2 dishes and tips, we paid close to $40. But the serving size makes up for the price since it took me 3 more meals before I finished all the leftovers :)

Will definitely be coming back whenever the urge to have spicy Chinese food comes back!"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My first time here. The space is rather barren and visually unappealing. I started by ordering one of their interesting-looking sake varieties by the glass, only to find out they are now served by the bottle only (at $20 and up). I went with the Ozeki, and the server didn't bother to unscrew the cap for me. I ordered wonton soup and the seafood and eggplant hotpot.  The soup broth was hot and savory, and the wontons meaty. The ""hotpot"" was served before I was halfway done with soup. It was more like a tureen, and the food color matched Fugu's interior - yellowish green and brown. A large portion of eggplant and not so much seafood, just a few small shrimp, scallops, calamari and krabmeat, served with basic rice. The sauce was fine but calamari was tough. I imagine they focus more on carryouts judging by the disinterested wait staff and constantly ringing phone. I won't be back."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Pretty decent place, especially for college students. Great for large groups and people who are not that picky about Asian food. We usually come here with a group of around 10 people and have never had trouble getting a table. I like the mapo tofu and some of the meat dishes. We also had a soup, but for next time, I would stick with the mapo tofu, meats, and eggplants. I think if I had ordered more ""orange chicken"" type of dishes, I would be less satisfied."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Oh Fugu, I used to HATE spicy food and now I'm falling in love with them. It's usually always crowded in Fugu, and most of their food are spicy. Here are what I usually order:

Lamb Cumin
Spicy String Bean
Mapo Tofu
Fried Crunchy Pork Intestine
Braised Beef in Hot Pot

If you're not used to spicy food at all, be seriously prepared. I cannot imagine how many pounds of chilies they order every day to cook their food."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I wish Fugu was more than it is.  It's not horrible, but it's not particularly good either.  I was there with a friend and I ordered pork and beancurd in a garlic sauce, which I know the name of in Chinese, but the translation they had on the menu is probably not the best.  

The sauce wasn't particularly good.  It was spicy like it should be but too thick and gelatinous.  My dish was smothered in it and I couldn't really taste anything but the garlic sauce.  I think this is the same garlic sauce that they use in several of their dishes.  The pork and beancurd was more like a vehicle for mediocre sauce.  

Growing up in LA though, I may be spoiled by my idea of good Chinese food and this doesn't even begin to compare with the myriad of options in LA.  If you're used to LA's options, this is not the place for you."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Very good spicy chicken. I always get the fried chicken with three peppers. Delivery call calls you as he's Peking so beware tho. In my opinion, the best  (authentic) Chinese deliver place in Madison."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Fugu generally has pretty authentic food, and despite changing management a couple times, they've maintained the quality of their food.  I ordered the spicy string beans, the garlic chicken, and cumin beef.  The meats in my meal were cooked really tender, which was really nice.  The flavors are really full too, and the sauces are abundant.  Enough to flavor the foods AND the rice. The rice is a bit too soft and fluffy for my taste, but that doesn't affect my review. However, BE WARNED: if you come in during busy hours, you might have to wait 30 minutes before you get your food ..."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Fugu is a wonderful little restaurant right off of state street!  The name is a little deceiving because it makes me think of the Japanese delicacy, but it is actually a Chinese restaurant (that serves Thai food?..I swear I saw some thai dishes on their menu...). 

My friend and I walked into the restaurant around 11AM on a Wednesday morning, so we didn't experience the longer wait time that other reviewers mentioned. We were promptly and politely escorted to a booth, and given plenty of time to peruse the menu. 

For lunch, the regular menu is pretty pricey ($9+ per person), but they do have a lunch specials menu with a smaller selection of dishes for more reasonable prices ($7.99).  My friend and I ended up ordering the Kungpao chicken and Mapo tofu lunch specials to share. 

I want to say that the cuisine is mostly from Szechuan..because MAN they really know how to use their hot peppers. Personally, I thought the food was very authentic......Obviously, nothing is going to beat the Chinese food from back at home, but I think Fugu comes close!

Now that I've found my go-to Chinese restaurant in Madison, I'm off to search for a Korean restaurant to add to my list!"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,The sesame pancakes are amazing. Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a very long time. Love the spicy eggplant dish too.
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I first tried this place after some friends brought some leftovers. Of course, that isn't necessarily an ideal first experience but the beef tripe and ox tongue was fantastic, so I had to check this place out. My husband and I went after work on a Friday night, so it was busy. The server took a bit to actually come by and acknowledge us, but considering how busy it was, I try to be understanding. Right away I ordered the beef tripe and ox tongue as well as the spicy fried intestines. My husband ordered twice cooked spicy pork. The beef tripe and ox tongue is really interesting to me because first and foremost, it's the first time I've had tripe in a dish other than menudo. My husband was really put off by the fact that it  was not served hot, but still liked the flavor. I believe it was supposed to be served that way, at least from what I remember my friends telling me. The best part of the meal was the spicy fried intestines, hands down. I've had beef intestines before (tacos de tripa con cilantro y cebolla, yum), but these were pork so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were AMAZING. Served up sliced in a big pile with a lot of red chilies, they had a nice crisp on the outside and the inside was soft and juicy. The flavor was different from beef intestine, similar but a little bit like tripe. I don't really know how to describe it. Oh my god, it has to be the best thing I've had in a while. EAT THEM. NOW."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"very poor chicken quality, about what you get at asian kitchen in terms of not wanting to look inside a piece"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Mediocre Chinese restaurant in Madison. Cliff and I came here for a cheat meal after a long cleanse. 

We ordered the black pepper deep fried chicken, garlic eggplant, and a seafood soup. 

The chicken was very disappointing; normally, chinese restaurants fry this chicken dish by the whole, but Fugu skimped out. They gave us the nasty little  parts of the chicken (including cartilage and god knows what else), heavily battered them, and fried them - so each bite consisted of crunchy dough and oil. A few pieces into the dish I started to question if they were even serving me actual chicken. 

The seafood soup was a miss. It was heavily salted and tasted as if they dumped frozen seafood inside an msg loaded broth. 

The eggplant was the only decent dish. I tasted sweet chili sauce more than anything else (didn't taste the garlic at all, so the name was misleading). Though it actually made me want to finish my rice. 

Aside from everything else, I feel like Fugu needs to chill with the red chili peppers and hot chili oil. They drench that in every single goddamn dish that when you finish and look at the plate, you realize that half of it consisted of red peppers."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,Try the steamed dumplings and the chicken fried rice. Everything was delicious but those two dishes were particularly tasty.
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"One of the best Chinese food resto I've had in the States. Not so oily. It also offers a wide variety of the dishes including hot pot and spicy noodles. Decent price that a college student like me can come a few times a week. The decoration and ambience is nice too. Just wish that they had more space because the waiting time is always like 15 mins before we can have the food.

I'm surprised that Madison has such a good place."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"It's ""Asian fusion."" So yes, Fugu is suffering from an identity crisis. But I come for the Szechuan food and it is spicy, authentic, and delicious."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This place is pretty decent, but the food is kind of expensive for what you get. I got an eggplant chicken dish and my boyfriend got a pork belly dish. It was all decent, but I think I would go somewhere else before returning here."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I'm a big fan of Chinese food and usually love everything I eat but this place is the exception. I went with a group of 12 people and the service was just not in sync. Not only did it take upwards to an hour to receive the food, but after the first meal was delivered, it took roughly 30 minutes for all the food to finally trickle to the table. Also, many appetizers were delivered long after entrees reached the table. 

As for the food, I ordered General Tso's Chicken. When I finally got my food, I found the balls of chicken to appear very large, however, I was quite disappointed when I ate it. The sauce was nice, it was sweet and had a touch of heat, but there was barely any chicken at all. Many times, there was no chicken in each ball and on the off chance that there was, it was just a tiny piece that was covered by a lot more batter. I essentially ate balls of batter with rice. 

I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants and although I recommend many to friends, this place is not one of them."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,Authentic hot spicy Chinese food. Hot pot with dried chile is great. Good service.  Not your typical midwest Chinese food.  And to find this in Madison is more amazing.  Don't let the name throw you-- it was probably a Japanese restaurant in an earlier life--but now really Chinese.  Forget the Thai food that's also on the menu.
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"After all the talk I heard about bad Chinese food after coming to Madison, I was scared I was going to be SOL in terms of good food.  This place flips it on its head though.  We got Shredded Beef with Spicy Capsicum, pork shortribs, and some chicken hotpot.  All awesome, all spicy, and plenty of food for the four of us to go around.  Big enough space that you're not sitting on top of each other as well."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The location of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being located on State St right on campus, it's definitely popular amongst students especially. They serve good Sze Chuan food, which means that the majority of the dishes will be cooked with spicy oil -- making them spicy. 

Their menu actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I order and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus, there are many reviews of Fugu out here with good recommendations on what to get, so I will talk more about the experience and service here. 

Went to lunch once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the lunch specials, which was a good deal coming to about $10. It has a set consisting of the main course, a soup and fruits to go with it. Most of their sets are served in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For dinner you just order off their menu.

Service wise, it's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your main course dishes might come before or together with your appetizers. On some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your order. But they are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. 

I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting area and ample parking. Between one or the other it all boils down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan dishes =)"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The place is clean and and cozy. The staff are friendly and prompt. The food however is something to be desired. I had the crab Rangoon, honey walnut shrimp, and salt and pepper calamari. The crab Rangoon's breading seems too floury. The walnut shrimp had really cheap breading that almost seems corn dog like with a watery sauce that is supposed to be thick. The salt and pepper squid seems to be made with old oil, and the breading again seems too floury. Maybe I'm just used to Chicago china town food, but I was disappointed."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Okay, Fugu, I'm sorry for taking such a long time to write a review for you, while I may be referred as a regular, by yelp standard. First time I came here was to have my own welcoming party held by my professor, supervisor and my new friends. Apparently, all of them have been regulars here for years so they ordered: the chicken with chillies (Sechuan style), fried tofu, and spicy fried fish, right away without any hesitation. They are all spicy and served our Indonesian tastebuds just right: we are all spicy eater. My American professor would only take a small portion, as it was too spicy for her. But, she liked it.  Other times, hubby and I would try their lamb stew- again, spicy but delectable.
In all, our meal experiences at Fugu have been always warm and nice. 
It's good, tho we all know, there should be some MSG involved."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,Definitely will go back...best wonton soup I've ever had. I got the Pai Thai which my waitress said was the same as Pad Thai however I was not a fan....it was very soupy and tasted a little like barbecue sauce honestly. I would not get that again but I tried my friends food and everything else was delicious! Seemed very authentic.
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My friend received a recommendation from a colleague and we decided to try this place on a rainy afternoon. We were the only patrons for most of our meal which led to the waitress staring at us while we ate our food. I ordered pad thai and the waitress proceeded to question my choice and asked me more than once if I knew what it was. I was fairly insulted. My friend ordered king pao chicken and veggie potstickers. The food came quickly with the potstickers being first. The dumplings weren't steamed long enough and tasted raw. My lunch combo box with the pad thai included a spring roll that was 95 percent wrapper, a Japanese style salad that was very watery, orange slices that were the best part of the meal, and the main dish that was disgusting. The sauce on the noodles was incredibly sweet and there weren't any raw veggies to add texture. I couldn't eat most of it and I am not a picky eater.  I sure hope that people who go there have a much better experience than we did. I certainly will never return."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I went here for lunch with a couple of friends.  First of all, I must agree with Lan that the space is MUCH more appealing than you would guess from outside, and the restrooms deserve a special note of their own--single occupant and I'm not kidding, they are beautifully decorated.  The overall ambiance was very nice.

For the meal, we shared the steamed dumplings and my friends had Sichuan dishes with pork and tofu, respectively, while I had the Thai basil noodles with chicken.  Madison is sadly lacking in Chinese food, but I would say we finally have a decent place in town for at least some traditional specialties.  The Sichuan menu items are appropriately spicy and my friends liked them a lot.  My Thai basil noodles with chicken were DELICIOUS.  My only complaint is that the sauce was a bit overly greasy, which one friend said was also an issue with his spicy garlic sauce, but it wasn't overwhelmingly so and we agreed that in both dishes, the flavor was still very good.

The steamed dumplings were serviceable although not particularly rave-worthy.  (Then again, their competition at the meal was fierce.)  The entree portions were large; I tend to pig out, but many people probably could have made two meals of them.

We also had hot tea, which was promptly refilled by our waitress as we ate (admittedly it wasn't very busy at 11:45 or so when we were there).  I really like green tea, and the flavor of Fugu's house tea is lovely--a bit bolder than Takara's, I would say, which I also like, but not too strong to enjoy with a meal.

I gave them $$ for price because many of the entrees are in the $10-15 range, but they have a lunch menu with a range of $8-10 specials.  Not at all expensive for the quantity and quality of the food, in my opinion.  You should note, however, that there is a $15 minimum for credit cards."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"After being disappointed by the lackluster turnout for Go Topless day, we headed to Fugu for a late lunch.  We opted for some small dishes to fill the gaping void in me left from last night's festivities.

I ordered the Sichuan Pork Wontons in chili oil and Hot & Sour soup. The wontons arrived fully submerged in a sea of slightly spicy oil. While it seemed a little excessive, the wontons were delicious. The combination of both was just what I needed to fill me up.

Pro tip: skip out on the General Tso's and order from the Sichuan menu section. Chicken with Spicy and Sour Garlic Sauce is always on point."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I've never given a restaurant one star before. I would actually give it a quarter star but my son did like his tom yum soup broth.   Note, broth only. 

Sunday dinner, which is usually nice. Decided to try someplace new for Chinese food, as Madtown has so few good choices and we had not had any in a while.

We had four dishes and soup. All were pretty bad. 

Crab Rangoon - soft wontons through, very little filling, greasy on bottom. Served with so little sauce it was very noticeable. 

Five flavor beef - so full of gristle it was almost inedible. We picked around gristle to at least give it a chance. Flavor was just ok, green inion on plate was slimy. 

Cold chicken in chili sauce. Looked thrown together. Smothered in chili oil. Slimy mess, although the chicken seemed fresh as I was lucky and got a pin feather in mine. (Note - I don't want to know if it was NOT a pin feather.)

Pork with mustard noodles. Pork was very gamey in an unpleasant way. Bland otherwise. Gelatinous.  Noodles were slimy and way over cooked.  

My hot and sour soup was a greasy gelatinous mess. 

I hate to say it, but the common adjectives of most of the dishes were ""greasy"", ""slimy"", over-oily, or ""gelatinous"", nine if which were in a good way. 

Will avoid this place. Recommend you do too. 

Sad, as we really hoped for a good Chinese place. 

Oops - almost forgot - and the prices were high end for Chinese food, in an environment that was also greasy. Ah well."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I had the Kung Pao Chicken, Dan dan noodles and the spring rolls. I loved everything. 
The kung pao had big pieces of chicken, peppers, zuchini, onions and bamboo shoots with a thick rich brown spicy sauce. 
The spring rolls were delivered still-hot and were great. Fried to a crisp and the sweet and sour was excellent. 
I ordered the dan dan noodles because a Chinese friend of mine used to make them for us  at his dinner parties. This came as a huge portion (as was the entree). Thin square noodles covered with ground pork sauce. Hot and tangy in a way its hard to describe, but delicious. I will definitely have their food again and maybe explore some of the more adventurous menu items."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We walked in and were greeted promptly by a hostess who took us to our table and gave us the menus to peruse. There are a lot of options including your typical American Chinese like Mongolian Beef or Orange Chicken as well as more exotic dishes like tripe, ox-tail, kidney, or intestine. When our waitress returned we ordered sake as well as 'Steamed White Meat Chicken with Chili Oil Sauce', 'Three Threads Salad', 'Sliced Lamb with Black Pepper', and 'Sauteed Baby Octopus with Pickled Pepper'. 

The chicken is an appetizer and appetizer priced, but you get a lot of chicken. It is served cold and has the skin on. It was our favorite dish. Both spicy and sweet, very tender, I absolutely loved this and will order it every time I go back. Like a lot of Chinese food it is practically floating in oil, but it was so good.

The Three Thread Salad is also an appetizer, also a good deal, and also delicious. It includes seaweed, bean noodle, and radish. Spicy and incredible. The flavors and textures were spot on and I would highly recommend this dish.

The lamb with black pepper was not what we were expecting. It was floating in a lot of oil. It contained blackened chopped spicy red peppers and there were dozens (hundreds?) of them. The flavor of the lamb and the sauce was incredible. I think it also had cilantro in it. However, the spicy blackened peppers were everywhere and although I love spicy food I could not eat them, so I had to pick out the beef which was a challenge with that many chopped peppers. Great flavor, but I would not order this dish again as it was just too much work.

The baby octopus dish was also delicious. Hot and spicy, with some vegetables I did not recognize. Some of the octopus were not as tender as I might like, but this was another very tasty dish.

We really enjoyed the flavors and textures of all the dishes we tried. The peppers made the lamb challenging to eat. Next time we go, we'll probably just do appetizers since they are nearly the same size as the entrees but only 1/2 the price.

I definitely recommend Fugu!"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This is a surprise in Madison where much of the food is bland or has been watered down for non-Asian tastebuds. One of the best authentic Asian restaurants in Madison. 

Started with ox tongue and tripe. A cold but spicy dish with two things I normally stay away from. The flavor and texturesof this dish are amazing. There is the soft tender tongue with loads of spicy flavor contrasted by the tripe which had a slight crunch when you bite into it"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Being in Madison for a couple of years, I'm pretty sure that if you want delicious and authentic Chinese food, this place is as good as it gets! They have many very authentic Chinese dishes you don't see very much elsewhere. I love the poached sliced beef in hot chilli sauce and the fish fillet dishes, they're delicious! Everything else I've tried here are all really great. The food can be really spicy, but you can always ask them to make it more mild. 

The servers are always really friendly and helpful. The restaurant gets pretty busy on the weekends, but I think it's worth the wait.

The food is a bit pricey, ranging from $10 to $15 per dish, but  the portions are big and it's not that bad if you share the dishes. One little down side is that they charge extra for rice. 

I highly recommend this place!"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night because Hong Kong Wok closes at 6pm.  Upon entering, it looks a lot more appealing than from the outside of the restaurant.

I went with a roommate and we shared three dishes: twice cooked pork ($13), ma po tofu ($11), and chicken with Sichuan sauce($9).  We both got orders of steamed rice, which cost an extra dollar per portion.

The twice cooked pork had some sort of bacon-type meat which was enjoyable with the green onion and while hot but less so as it became cooler.  The tofu was excellent a generous spicy sauce that probably included numbing pepper.  And the chicken was tender and the vegetables cooked just right.  The rice was fresh.

I definitely recommend Fugu if you're looking for spicy, well sauced Chinese/Szechuan dishes.  All the dishes were made to order and came out hot and delicious, though more expensive than your typically-priced Chinese dishes.  The service is also quite nice.  Next time I'll have to try some of their other ethnic cuisines.

A 15% gratuity was included, however, but I did not considering how good the food and polite the staff were."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The menu is huge here and you'd likely have to go to Fugu several times before discovering your favorite items. My favorite dish here is the sliced fish with sweet and sour sauce. I've never had anything as similar and as tasty as this. The cumin beef and the twice cooked slice pork are also great choices here. Not sure why, but I also really like their spicy string beans.

In addition, ordering for takeout at Fugu is pretty convenient. I've never seen such a great set up for an Asian restaurant. You can order online and there is usually a discount for doing it this way. Just check out Fugu's website.

Your best and closest bet for good, authentic Chinese food in Madison would be Fugu. There is no close second."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Try popcorn chicken,deep fried intestine and their spicy fish fillet,da bomb!!!!!"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We had the Kung Pao chicken and General Tso's chicken. Kung Pao was pretty Americanized-- slightly sweet, no spiciness, but a good texture. Portion size was average, not giant but not small. For ~$11 it wasn't as good as I had hoped. A good peanut to chicken ratio though.

General Tso was typical General Tso... neon colored, sweet chunks of chicken to tame the Chinese takeout desire. Again, at $10.50, it was on the high side. Not the best I've had, but not the worst. 

Service was fast and efficient. Probably won't go back unless I want some authentic Sichuan- as the American-style offerings were pretty mediocre."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,Absolutely love this place!  As others said stick to the real asian cuisine here and this place is awesome!  I personally love the Braised Beef hot pot.  It is not overly spicy and has really great flavor.  As a regular to this establishment I receive extremely good service.  The last 4 or 5 times I was here my food came out in what seemed like less than 5 minutes and was perfect while the restaurant was full!
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Fugu has excellent reviews, it is within walking distance of my crib, and it is packed to brimming with Chinese students.  They only serve chopsticks unless you ask for silverware.  They have huge tables for a large crowd with a round serving tray in the middle that spins so people can take a bit of everything and share their meals conveniently.  

I ordered the Cumin crusted lamb, and spicy green beans.  I really was not impressed.  The beans were super salty, and the lamb dried up with the overwhelmingly Cumin flavor.  

I will try again, this place has gotten far too many kudos, and is far too busy for it to be just me.  Next time I'll order something different and let you know how it goes."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My husband and I went to Fugu for a late lunch.  We were promptly seated and given menus.  The menu has many dishes which sound amazing.  We got a couple apps and 2 entrées.  The sesame pancakes and dan dan noodles were so good.  My husband got the Singapore noodles which had a wonderful, spicy curry flavor.  I got the chicken with spicy and sour sauce.  The sauce was very tasty.  Overall, it was a great experience and would go again.  My fav Asian restaurant so far."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Hands down my favorite Asian restaurant in Madison:

Let me start by saying that I am not of Chinese decent, nor have I ever traveled to China,  but I have a feeling that this is what authentic Chinese cuisine tastes like. Every time I walk in there, the place is PACKED with people chatting in Mandarin over big family-style dishes. Furthermore, it is SO SO SO much better than any ""Americanized"" Chinese food I've ever had. 

My favorite part about this place is definitely the sichuan pepper dishes. They are an extremely difficult ingredient to get your hands on if you don't have access to an Asian foods market, but they're absolutely delicious (and spicy to boot)! Favorites of mine include sichuan cucumber salad and sichuan eggplant, but the pickled pepper dishes look fabulous as well! Everything on the ""regular"" (not ""American-Style"") menu here that is advertised as ""spicy"" is ACTUALLY spicy, which I love! The food is bursting with flavor and these dishes make it easy to understand why Chinese fare is typically served with WHITE (not fried) rice: the rice soaks up all of the delicious juices and becomes one of the most flavorful components of the meal.

Speaking of rice, the rice here is PHENOMENAL and is cooked to perfection (both white and fried). For all of you naysayers out there who think that rice can't be done ""wrong,"" you're mistaken. Fried rice lovers, take one bite of the fried rice at FUGU and you will understand that every other Chinese place you've ever been to has cooked their rice to a lower standard. Here, it is soft, fluffy, flavorful, and just slightly sticky. YUM. It's the best fried rice I've ever had. 

Like most Asian restaurants, the selection is huge and there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options (vegan PRO TIP: try the garlic eggplant--out of this world! Just make sure to spread the spicy oils over your rice). I have yet to venture out and try some of the REALLY authentic dishes (tripe, ox tongue, etc), but some of the borderline-authentic stuff has come up short for me (in particular, the pork dumplings with chili oil--I couldn't stomach them). I've also gone in the opposite direction: the ""American Style"" menu is expansive, but FUGU does NOT do American Chinese food well (shame on them for being TOO authentic--lol). There is a consistent lack of spice and flavor with every dish I've tried on that menu (although the quality of products is still supreme). I think it best to stick with the ""middle ground"" of the menu here. 

Overall, give FUGU a shot, and you won't be disappointed (at least not for carry out; I've never dined in)."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I think I may have just found the one.

It was a late Saturday afternoon, and we were preparing for the copious amount of alcohol we were about to consume that night.

Knowing that the best way to not get completely trashed was food in our bellies, my friends and I set out on a quest to find some alcohol buffer. 

After going through countless takeout menus online, we finally settled on Fugu. Having never heard about this place before, our expectations were pretty low.

First of all, the Chinese food in Madison is crap, period (Sorry Madisonians(?), just being honest).

Second, this place is located right off of State Street, which is basically drunk haven for college kids.

Third, this place is called Fugu.... and they sell Chinese food. Dictionary.com defines fugu as ""a puffer fish that is eaten as a Japanese delicacy, after some highly poisonous parts have been removed by an authorized chef."" 

So ok, this place is named after a highly poisonous Japanese delicacy, but serves Chinese food... 

Alright then, moving on...

As soon as we opened up the menu, however, I knew we were in for a special treat. My non-Asian roommate couldn't read the menu at all, which is immediately a good sign when it comes to Chinese food.

As I browsed through the list of food, I saw quite a few authentic Chinese dishes that I was so used to back in Boston. 

We ordered the sesame pancakes, Singapore beef noodle, eggplant in garlic sauce and deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper. 

It took roughly ~30 minutes of wait time before the food was delivered right to our doorsteps. The fact that this place delivers AUTHENTIC Chinese food alone should merit 5-stars.

While waiting for our friend to bring up the food, the aromatic scent of delicious Szechuan cuisine wafted through our house, and made our mouths water. The moment the food was set on the table, we went into it like ravenous savages, and devoured the food within minutes.

It was definitely not a pretty sight, but oh was it ever so delicious... I can still taste the soft eggplants with its sweet, garlic sauce. The numbingly spicy chicken with its perfect crusty skin. The thin, dry noodles intervened with tender pieces of beef and vegetables.

Everything about the meal was delicious. I thought I had fallen in love before, but it wasn't until now, that I have realized my naivety. 

Fugu, you're now my number 1 love in Madison."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I've been resisting going to this place for the past several years. The location was previously an 'all you can eat' place called Yummy Buffet.  It's illogical why I resisted.

I went here recently and ordered the cold chicken, eggplant dish, and fried chicken.  Everything tasted amazing, but in particular, I want to say, be open to the cold chicken dish - the briny sauce it was smothered in was a heavenly combination of sweet, tangy, and salty.

I'm definitely coming back here again.  Three dishes came out to $30 or so for two people.  You could also go cheaper and order the lunch bentos."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"So I'm in town on a business trip and sick as a dog. I decided that only some Asian cuisine would do. I ordered fairly simple fare -- Wonton Soup with Garlic Pork Spareribs. The soup was bland with a greasy consistently. The two wontons had a strange texture.. Almost like they'd been boiling for hours. The flavor and texture was unpleasant. Then the Garlic Spareribs were breaded and we're not boneless. I figured this out when I made the mistake of biting into one. It would've been ok if it at least tasted good, but no.  I was really disappointed by the meal. Promising menu, but the food doesn't deliver."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Somehow I have lived a block and a half away from Fugu for three years and never tried it.  Something about the exterior (one prominent sign advising ""No Public Restrooms"" and two more warning of hidden cameras in operation) just turned me off.  That all changed yesterday when my wife and I finally gave it a try.  Oh my God-- absolutely delicious!  I'll get the bad out of the way first-- the restaurant was fairly crowded for 4:00 in the afternoon and only one waiter was working-- there were a lot of tables that hadn't been cleared and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  One of our water glasses was also less than clean.  But I don't even care because the food was A-MA-ZING.  I've been craving a decent hot and sour soup ever since I moved to Madison and they delivered.  The chicken with garlic sauce was perfect.  The waiter (who was extremely nice) warned me about how spicy the fried beef in chili sauce would be and he was right.  It was also delicious.   We've eaten there two days in a row now and will definitely be back.

Edit: I'm downgrading this to four stars.  I've been back a number of times (mostly for takeout) and I'll definitely be going back, but it hasn't worked out to be a five-star performance.  

Two main problems: 1) Consistency: Some things are really, really good and a great value.  Some things are less good (mongolian beef was tough, hunan beef didn't have much beef).  Some things that are often good are sometimes not good (hot and sour soup).  2) Service: Everyone is very nice, but the place just doesn't run well.  They need someone coordinating everything, because the service is slow and out of joint."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Fugu is beyond comparison. Nothing in Madison can touch the quality and variety offered on the extensive and exciting menu. I was reminded of several of my favourite Sichuan places in San Francisco the first time I dined at fugu and I haven't been disappointed since.

MUST TRIES: 

Lamb hot pot. Complete with the famous and addictive ""numbing spice"" (Sichuan peppercorn, hua jiao)

Dry-fried chicken with Sichuan peppercorn

Eggplant in Sichuan sauce

Ma Po Tofu"
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Perhaps one mark of authenticity at Fugu is the fact that a lot of the menu will scare and confuse you. Blood intestine? Bean curd? I have yet to be adventurous enough to try one of these menu items. I instead try to settle on something that resembles your typical Chinese take-out, without going for anything too boring.

I always start a meal here with the spring rolls. They're cooked to a perfect texture, with a thin, crispy outer shell that crunches like a potato chip, and a soft vegetable-filled mush inside. They taste a little bland, but that's easily offset by the great sweet-and-sour sauce served on the side with the spring rolls.

I highly recommend the beef with ginger and scallions as an entree. Whereas most Asian places will overload a dish with vegetables in order to save money on the meat, Fugu has done the exact opposite. I almost missed the vegetables, but the meat is too good for me to care. It's cooked so perfectly, to the point where it practically melts in your mouth. You'll find meat like this in all their beef dishes as well.

On a different occasion, though, I decided to get the fried shredded beef in hot chili sauce, and wasn't as impressed. Once again, the beef was a perfectly-cooked blend of fat and meat that made it taste and feel like beef and butter had a baby. It was cut into thick strips which could hardly be called ""shredded,"" but that was probably for the best. The sauce and spices surrounding the beef, on the other hand, weren't too good. I was warned that the dish was going to be very spicy, but I certainly wasn't expecting to be served a dish that was almost half comprised of chili peppers and ginger. Most of the dish wasn't even edible!

If you do decide to get something simple like the chicken lo mein, you'll be pleased with it. I didn't get anything that goes above and beyond all expectations, but honestly, I don't even know how you could do so with something like chicken lo mein. The lo mein was soft and buttery, with a simple and traditional blend of add-ins. The chicken was good, but nothing special. All in all, it's certainly better than take-out.

The prices here are slightly higher than normal, but you do get a noticeable step up in quality that justifies it. Furthermore, the portions are huge. Unless you plan on taking home leftovers, you should probably just buy one entree per two people.

The service is consistently a problem.  It is somewhat slow, even when the restaurant is empty. Requests for things like condiments are often ignored or unanswered for long periods of time. This is due in part to the fact that most of Fugu's staff has very poor English. It's very irritating that I can't have menu items explained to me because myself and the waiter can't even understand one another. You can put whoever you want in your kitchen, but it's unacceptable to put out a wait staff that can't communicate with the customers."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I really just didn't like it that much. The Pad Thai was like Sweet and Sour instead of Peanut Sauce, and the curry was waaay salty. On the bright side, the Mouchi was really good, and you should definitely get it. This isn't the best town for Asian food, but you can do better. I'd recommend Vientiane (or something similar to that). The service was quick (almost too quick) and the staff very friendly."
Fugu,76. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Food here is excellent.  Like a previous reviewer noted, where there is a red pepper on the menu, the dish is spicy.  Not too spicy to enjoy, mind you, but you'll want lots of water.  The only real knock against this place is the service.  Everyone is nice enough but very slow and hard to get wait staff's attention for something.  Relatedly, it is very crowded on weekend nights.  But really worth it for the delicious cuisine."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I have to say, the menu at Fugu looks pretty similar to the menu at Ichiban. My boyfriend and I ordered the garlic eggplant and the baby octopus with pickled peppers from the house specials. We both loved the octopus dish, which was savory and spicy. The garlic eggplant was a bit on the oily side, with a one-dimensional flavor. We were also seated near an air vent, and it felt too hot the whole time we were there. 5 stars for the octopus, 2 stars for the eggplant, and 1 star for the heating situation."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"If I were to name three restaurants in Madison I can't live without, Fugu would be one of them!  Pleasant ambiance, good service and DELICIOUS food! 

Their 'pork dumplings' are undoubtedly the best I have ever had. And the taste is consistent no matter what time of the day. I would strongly recommend their 'Chicken with spicy and sour Garlic sauce'. It is unlike any Chinese Chicken dish I have ever had in or outside Madison. Their fried fish is also very delicious.

A must-try for even someone who does not like chinese food. You might just change your mind after going to Fugu!"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"A group of friends and I came here after a day of snowboarding craving some spicy food. This place is by far the most authentic Szechuan restaurant I've been to. I'm not joking, Fugu would seriously destroy other Chinese restaurants if they decide to move to Chicago Chinatown. 

We ordered 2 cold appetizers and 5 entrees for 5 of us. I'm not sure if the waiting was truly long,  or we just felt like it because we were in a room full of spicy aroma. But once they started serving the dishes, it was really fast, we had all our 7 plates in 10min. We started with two very traditional dishes, pepper shredded tripe and ox tongue and tripe, which I always use to test the authenticity of a Szechuan restaurant. Fugu definitely passed my test. Everyone suddenly stopped talking and quietly enjoyed the texture and the flavor. 

The house-special steamed lamb pot was really good and I also loved the crispy chili (haven't had it for years and I found it here!). I was a little bit disappointed with the poached beef, fish with pickled chili and spicy aromatic pig blood tofu. They were good, but they just didn't meet the high expectations I built up after the cold appetizers and first two dishes. I can't explain what was it, but there was something missing in their flavor, maybe it needs to a little bit more complexity of spicy and sour? 

The waiter was very friendly and he asked for our suggestions and even apologized for ""letting us down"" with some of the dishes. I gave Fugu a solid 4 stars and I will definitely revisit this place. If you love authentic Chinese food, Fugu is the place to go!"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I came for a quick bite and just ordered from the appetizer menu. 

Things I had:

Sweet Potato Pancakes: these were very interesting and not what I expected. They appear to be deep fried pouches of a sweet potato purée-like filling. The balance between crunchy outside and gooey inside is a nice balance. These are only slightly sweet and I wish weren't so oily.

Beef in Lettuce Cup: the plating was nice but not sure how they got ""cups"". I expected lettuce  wraps but received beef with lettuce pieces. I could not scoop then into lettuce cups as the lettuce was chopped too much. Flavor wise this was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend this if you want a lighter low carb dinner, and it's much cheaper than the entrees and the portion isn't too much! 

Ambiance: a little dark for my liking and I went during lunch time. I sat by the window which made it bearable, otherwise it was way too dark."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"4 stars for one of two most authentic Chinese restaurants in town!
4 stars for the only Chinese restaurant specializing in Sezchuan foods.
5 stars for the o-so-spicy-it-makes-your-mouth-drooling-and-your-eyes-teary spicy fried chicken (other recommended menu includes tofu and mushroom in white sauce, spicy dandan noodle, and spicy wonton)
3 stars for the fish with spicy sauce, cold tripe/tendon.
3 stars for the relatively expensive price"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"This is the beginning of a new love affair. A Chinese coworker brought me here after work last week stating this is the most authentic in Madison, and after scanning through their menu which included kidneys and intestines, I was beginning to feel a bit giddy. 

The flavor in my Lao Gan Ma twice cooked pork tasted just like the ones I've had in Chinatowns and I've visited ALL the chinatowns in this country. I loved the sauce so much that I poured my rice into the plate at the end and gobbled up every last drop of that delicious greasiness. 

The only complaint I have is their dining room being too dark and too cold. I mean, the food really isn't SO spicy that you would feel the need for icy air to cool down. So minus one star for ambience. 

I will be back. Possibly tomorrow and every week after."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Fugu is among the top two Chinese restaurants in Madison serving authentic, family-style Chinese cuisine. A bit heavy handed with the salt and msg, but of course this means the food was good. I was delighted that one of their seasonal vegetable options was Water Spinach / Ong Choy / Kong Xin Cai. The stir-fried thick rice noodles with chicken was also a good bet.

Like other Chinese/Asian fusion restaurants in Madison, Fugu is undergoing an identity crisis. Rather than serving a cohesive selection of items, I imagine this place developed its concept by catering to the whim of its customers. I guess business is business. 

Our waiter was charming and patient when trying to explain some of the difficult-to-translate menu items. 

The price point is high for home-cooked Chinese food, but I'm learning to expect this of State St. establishments."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,The most authentic Chinese food in Madison! I have searched long and hard for the food I learned to love when I lived in China 10 years ago and Fugu delivers. Must haves are the spicy twice cooked sliced pork ( pork belly) and the sezchaun spicy wontons... Enjoy
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Normally not a fan of Chinese, this was much better than most I've had. (And that's a compliment coming from me).  This place was bustling at 7:30pm on a Friday night but our carryout order was on time.  I was lucky enough to have someone with me so we could double-park, otherwise you may struggle to pick up your food as this is right off of State St.

I ordered the veggies & shittake mushroom (added tofu, a girl needs her protein, for $1,50).  Glad I did as the ""veggies"" otherwise were simply bok choy and shittakes.   The veggies were plump, flavorful, and fresh. The tofu was lightly fried and not too greasy. The sauce wasn't too heavy but also was on the bland side, it could have used a bit more flavor (not spice, I'm talkin' flavor here),  The Kung Pao chicken got rave reviews at our house for being delicious and not too greasy (take note other Chinese restaurants, you're tooooo greeeeeeasy).  The steamed veggie dumplings ($4.50) were perfectly fine, but nothing I'd write home about.  

All in all, if we were to order Chinese carryout again, this would be the place."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Having read an article about Fugu in either Madison Magazine or Madison Originals, I was very excited to try an authentic restaurant. 

And yet sadly, Fugu disappoints. The interior ambiance is fine... nothing special, but decent. 

The food I had was just disappointing. On my first visit, I tried an order of the pan-fried noodles, which I had expected to be crispy. They were not even close to what I had come to expect from Chicago's Chinatown. This might have been ok if they weren't also unbearably garlicky and salty, so much so that no amount of water would have satiated the thirst I got from eating the meal. My husband fared slightly better with the pad thai lunch box, but he wasn't a huge fan, either. On my second visit, I tried a Massaman curry lunch box. I was much happier with this option, as the flavors were good, and the vegetables included were some of my favorites. However, when I actually put the curry sauce on my rice (rather than just pulling the veggies out of the sauce), I realized that the sauce had a gritty/sandy texture that was quite unpleasant on my teeth. 

Most importantly, the service was extremely slow. My second visit was over lunch on a work day, and we couldn't even catch the waitress' eye to get more water or anything else we needed. After a good 35-45 minutes of no attention whatsoever, we had to head back to work. Thankfully, we had cash, so without ever receiving the check, we were able to leave the appropriate amount of money on the table and leave. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"As far as Chinese food goes, this is the best in Madison, which is why it gets 5 stars.  The only other comparable location is Ichiban Szechuan, and that restaurant is more oily and less flavorful.

The style here is mostly from southern China--most dishes are spicy, and there are very few vegetarian options (though the vegetarian options are delicious as well).

One thing to note is that their 'hotpot' dishes aren't what you'd expect of 'huo guo'.  These are mostly dry dishes kept heated over a flame.  Worth a try if you're curious.

They have 'Americanized' menu items which tend to be a little too sweet.  I would recommend getting anything with a Chinese name next to it. 

Items I usually get:
Mapo Tofu
Spicy twice cooked fish
Cumin lamb
Hot and sour soup

The service is usually fast, but can be slow on busier days."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"This place has the spicy Chinese food i've been craving for. They got some American Chinese food but mostly true authentic Chinese food you don't see much. This is the only reason you should go here for and order. I bet most people are brained washed thinking that Chinese buffet restaurants are true Chinese food. The young unwise me was once.

When I first arrived I had to wait out front alone for a few minutes before someone finally came out of the kitchen. Put after that service was on. Friendly and helpful. Their was only one other couple in the place the whole time I was there on a Monday night.

They have two menu ""books"". Took me awhile to figure out what to order even thou I had looked over their menu online a little bit.

First dish to arrive was the Spicy Green Beans. Crisps bite with slices of garlic and chucks of dry chilies. Greasier than I would of liked. Huge pool of oil on the bottom of plate. Had a kick to it but nothing compared to the next dish. The Mapo Tofu. Mouth on fire, nose running, the way I like it good. Chili oil, minced pork, scallions, szechuan pepper, and tofu. Hard to eat with chopsticks. The side of rice was excellent to soak up all the liquid.
 
No buffet here. But great place to get a group of friends together and order a huge amount of plates to get a wide tasting of their menu."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Fugu has been one of my bigger disappointments in Madison dining, because i've heard both my friend and yelp peers give big ups to it, but my experiences here have really failed to meet expectations. All of the times i've been here, i've noticed two trends: Bland entrees, and slow service.

With regard to the entrees: Some reviews on here are claiming that some of the dishes are great, so maybe i'm just ordering the wrong things. But, I got a mushroom dish, and an assortment of veggie dishes, and all of those left a lot to be desired. The mushroom dish had some spice, but the mushroom texture was inconsistent, so it wasn't too great. The veggies were often just the veggie in question with some rice, sometimes in a tasteless sauce. It didn't feel like anything that I couldn't have made at home easily.

As for the service, it's just often really slow. Slow for them to seat you, slow to take your order, slow for them to fill up your water (which really sucks if you get a spicy dish and you're a spice wimp like myself), and slow for them to get your bill. I went at times that were only semi-crowded, but regardless it didn't seem like it should have been taking so long. They could benefit from adding another wait staff to take orders at peak hours.

My experience as Fugu hasn't been all bad, though. Note that I only mentioned the entrees being bland. I've had some pretty excellent appetizers, such as the Sesame cakes, which came with a very awesome savory sauce. I'd definitely be willing to try Fugu again, but only if I had a lot of free time that night, and a very good tip from someone on what to order."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"My family (2 adults and 2 kids) went there today for lunch. We ordered pork stomach with chili sauce, chicken lo-mein and lunch plate. We liked it and had pleasant experience. However, my food, pork stomach, was a bit greasy. It was a quiet day at lunch and the kids ate their lo-mein and hubby liked what's on the platter. However, we were disappointed that they no longer served dim-sum. After all these time, we have been waiting for a decent dim-sum place in Madison and Milwaukee area. 
Like previous reviewers, I was surprised to see the cute little bathroom in the back with cool Asian inspired decorations. I have mixed feelings about whether to go back there. We will definitely go back if they offer dim-sum again. Otherwise, I think we can find equally if not better Thai and Chinese restaurants in town."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"My fiance loves this place to death. I have tried about 10 dishes here in hopes of finding one that I will like enough to be happy when he wants to order Fugu instead of switching into clever-ploys-to-do-something-other-than-Fugu mode.

I can't put my finger on it, exactly, but everything seems to be too much or too little of too many things. Too spicy, too greasy, too bland, too many bones I have to pick out. It's like that dish that you cook for yourself at home and when you go to taste it you think oh dang, this isn't very good but I made it so I might as well eat it. But you don't really want to feel that way about takeout that you get all the time, you know?"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"This was probably the worst Chinese food we've ever had. We ordered mango smoothie, wonton soup, kung pao chicken, and general Taos chicken.  Generals was so battered and friend we couldn't find the chicken inside. And the Kung pao was fried, which never happens; it's typically grilled. So we ordered a 3rd meal, another chicken dish and I was the worst quality of meat ever. We left completely disappointed and $50 down the drain."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I've been here several times, mostly it was ok, but sometimes there's no service.
Or the service you got is their stare.

2 things I don't like about this place is,

--I like/cook Chinese food, but when dining out, its oily feature always concerns me.  I therefore have to use extra 2 bowls for getting rid of excessive oil/salt, otherwise my body can't take it.
I got stares several times. Even more when I asked the 2nd bowl, having to walk over to the counter while waitress chatting, 5 people in the restaurant.
--I like seafood but the fish with tofu in spicy sauce is not fresh at all. I live in coastal area before so could tell the difference very well. The fish they use is definitely frozen ones.  15.95 for frozen fish doesn't get my business.

Having said that, it's pretty good flavor with most dishes we try, and relatively inexpensive. In terms of service, how would I say? It's just a very Chinese way, meaning if you say thank you to them they ignore you.  Having have to go to the counter to pay yourself. We've lived in HK before and literally got shoutings from them so know what it's like (but of course never like it). Guess in Chinese culture restaurant is about food, not service.

Last time I paid tips with lower percentage. The lady looked kinda disappointed. Hey, same here. How do I know the tips go to people serving me?"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I ended up going twice in a week.  Interesting mix of Chinese-American and ""real"" Szechuan.  You get two menus, one of which is really large.  Huge variety of food to choose from.

On the first visit, I went with a vegetarian friend and there were lots of options for her.  After reading reviews, we ordered the sesame pancakes, which were good, but they were like deep fried roti with sesame on them.  They didn't taste very Chinese-y but were tasty.  Greasy but tasty.

We shared the Ma Po tofu and still didn't finish it all - really good dish - spicy (not too much) and a lot of flavor.

On my second trip I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, recommended by another friend.  The waitress asked which one I wanted - there was an American-Chinese style and a Szechuan version.  I got the Szechuan version.  You know those red chili peppers in a lot of spicy Chinese dishes?  There were a ton and chopped up so if you don't like eating them (like me, I love them in the food for flavor but they give me massive heartburn), you have to pick out a lot of them.  The chicken was deliciously cooked - perfectly tender and also had slices of garlic and I think some ginger.  Of course, there was a generous supply of peanuts.

They also have some interesting dishes like fried spicy intestines that I wanted to try but wimped out."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Yum.  In town visiting a friend and came here by chance, I ordered the pan fried noodles (asked for them to be spicy!) and my friend ordered the kung pao chicken. We both loved our food, and my friend has decided to definitely come here more often now! FYI that the pop comes in cans."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"My coworker and I found this on Yelp while in town on a client trip. I had been specifically looking for a great Thai option. We have some thai in Iowa City (one pretty good one) but I figured there'd be something outstanding in Madison. We were not disappointed. I have eaten thai from sea to shining sea and I honestly thing\k the masaman sauce here was the best I have ever had. Modest interior - nice/chintzy-casual, accessible and obviously in a student area. Coldplay's latest album rotated twice while we were there which added to the experience for me. Good prices. And, again, really really good. I left with the ""thai glow."" :-)"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Fugu has been my ""go to"" for ""authentic"" Chinese food for a while but I do have some complaints.

The boiled beef is traditionally supposed to come in a spicy broth but at Fugu, it comes with a syrupy, spicy sauce. It tasted fine but it wasn't what I was expecting, especially since I know that I've had the authentic version here in the past. When I mentioned it to my waitress, she just told me that the brothy version is what they do in China, but at Fugu, this syrupy, saucy dish is how they make it.

Other than that, the food is fine. It's actually pretty good. The prices are definitely steeper than some of the other Chinese places around State but if you're looking for good ""authentic"" Chinese food at a sit down restaurant, Fugu is your still best choice."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Ah, what can I say. Seems like a very popular option amongst international UW Chinese students who wants a taste of home, as it is in a very convenient location and the food quality is as authentic as it gets here in Madison.

Food - on our visit, we had the ox tripe and tongue appetizer along with sliced chicken in garlic sauce (classic Chinese dish but replacing pork with chicken) and shredded pork in bean sauce. Food was great but we should've went with a veggie dish instead of meat on top of meat. Spiciness is my thing and this place quenched my desire for spicy Chinese food. 

Service - compared to the food, service is lacking. After we were seated  no waiters came to our table for the next 15 minutes. I had to tell the person up front that we're still waiting to order. After we were finished, it took another 10-15 to give us the check, we were thinking of just walking out without paying :P

Price - if you're really desperate to eat authentic Chinese, the price isn't a factor. But compared to most Chinese eateries, this is definitely on the pricier side. For 1 appetizer and 2 dishes and tips, we paid close to $40. But the serving size makes up for the price since it took me 3 more meals before I finished all the leftovers :)

Will definitely be coming back whenever the urge to have spicy Chinese food comes back!"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I have gone to Fugu several times in the past, and always enjoyed it. They have some very interesting menu choices. The atmosphere gives off good vibes and the service is cheerful. Fugu is a great place to go if you enjoy unique Asian cuisine. 

However, my latest experience has prompted me to write my first Yelp review. I ordered the Beef with Ginger and Scallion to have delivered for lunch, but when it arrived the portion size was substantially modest compared to what I was used to when I dine in. I could not believe they would post the same $14 item for take-out and provide a paltry amount of food compared to dine-in. I was looking forward to enjoying my lunch, but all I could taste was disappointment."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"My first time here. The space is rather barren and visually unappealing. I started by ordering one of their interesting-looking sake varieties by the glass, only to find out they are now served by the bottle only (at $20 and up). I went with the Ozeki, and the server didn't bother to unscrew the cap for me. I ordered wonton soup and the seafood and eggplant hotpot.  The soup broth was hot and savory, and the wontons meaty. The ""hotpot"" was served before I was halfway done with soup. It was more like a tureen, and the food color matched Fugu's interior - yellowish green and brown. A large portion of eggplant and not so much seafood, just a few small shrimp, scallops, calamari and krabmeat, served with basic rice. The sauce was fine but calamari was tough. I imagine they focus more on carryouts judging by the disinterested wait staff and constantly ringing phone. I won't be back."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Pretty decent place, especially for college students. Great for large groups and people who are not that picky about Asian food. We usually come here with a group of around 10 people and have never had trouble getting a table. I like the mapo tofu and some of the meat dishes. We also had a soup, but for next time, I would stick with the mapo tofu, meats, and eggplants. I think if I had ordered more ""orange chicken"" type of dishes, I would be less satisfied."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Oh Fugu, I used to HATE spicy food and now I'm falling in love with them. It's usually always crowded in Fugu, and most of their food are spicy. Here are what I usually order:

Lamb Cumin
Spicy String Bean
Mapo Tofu
Fried Crunchy Pork Intestine
Braised Beef in Hot Pot

If you're not used to spicy food at all, be seriously prepared. I cannot imagine how many pounds of chilies they order every day to cook their food."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I wish Fugu was more than it is.  It's not horrible, but it's not particularly good either.  I was there with a friend and I ordered pork and beancurd in a garlic sauce, which I know the name of in Chinese, but the translation they had on the menu is probably not the best.  

The sauce wasn't particularly good.  It was spicy like it should be but too thick and gelatinous.  My dish was smothered in it and I couldn't really taste anything but the garlic sauce.  I think this is the same garlic sauce that they use in several of their dishes.  The pork and beancurd was more like a vehicle for mediocre sauce.  

Growing up in LA though, I may be spoiled by my idea of good Chinese food and this doesn't even begin to compare with the myriad of options in LA.  If you're used to LA's options, this is not the place for you."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Very good spicy chicken. I always get the fried chicken with three peppers. Delivery call calls you as he's Peking so beware tho. In my opinion, the best  (authentic) Chinese deliver place in Madison."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Fugu generally has pretty authentic food, and despite changing management a couple times, they've maintained the quality of their food.  I ordered the spicy string beans, the garlic chicken, and cumin beef.  The meats in my meal were cooked really tender, which was really nice.  The flavors are really full too, and the sauces are abundant.  Enough to flavor the foods AND the rice. The rice is a bit too soft and fluffy for my taste, but that doesn't affect my review. However, BE WARNED: if you come in during busy hours, you might have to wait 30 minutes before you get your food ..."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Fugu is a wonderful little restaurant right off of state street!  The name is a little deceiving because it makes me think of the Japanese delicacy, but it is actually a Chinese restaurant (that serves Thai food?..I swear I saw some thai dishes on their menu...). 

My friend and I walked into the restaurant around 11AM on a Wednesday morning, so we didn't experience the longer wait time that other reviewers mentioned. We were promptly and politely escorted to a booth, and given plenty of time to peruse the menu. 

For lunch, the regular menu is pretty pricey ($9+ per person), but they do have a lunch specials menu with a smaller selection of dishes for more reasonable prices ($7.99).  My friend and I ended up ordering the Kungpao chicken and Mapo tofu lunch specials to share. 

I want to say that the cuisine is mostly from Szechuan..because MAN they really know how to use their hot peppers. Personally, I thought the food was very authentic......Obviously, nothing is going to beat the Chinese food from back at home, but I think Fugu comes close!

Now that I've found my go-to Chinese restaurant in Madison, I'm off to search for a Korean restaurant to add to my list!"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"New pan-Asian on Gilman just off State Street, in the location of the old Yummy Buffet.  Small restaurant offering live seafood from a tank and a wide menu of Chinese, Thai, and Japanese dishes, and featuring an interesting-sounding list of Szechuan specialties:  if you're on State Street and hankering for pig ears, pig blood, or pig stomach, Fugu is your best and only bet.  

Stopped in here for lunch a little after 1pm and found the place almost empty.  Ordered the lunch box with shrimp in Szechuan sauce.  The accompaniments were pretty standard -- a small spring roll, a small salad with standard Japanese-restaurant dressing, a few hunks of fruit.  The main dish itself, though, was great, asserting itself with a nice complex spiciness, not overwhelming heat or overwhelming grease.  I'll be coming back for dinner to try some of the Szechuan specialties (maybe not pig blood.)

Update:  had another lunch here and ordered the cured meat with green beans off the Chef's Specialties list (pictured above.)  This was terrific -- the beans dry-cooked until wrinkly but still rich, moist, and flavorful, and just enough pork to give the whole dish a luxurious feel.  On the strength of this dish I'm declaring Fugu the best Chinese restaurant in Madison (admittedly against weak competition now that China Palace is gone) and upping my rating to five stars.  

Fugu is a bit more expensive than the average Chinese place; dinner entrees are $12-19 (and rice is $1 extra), and the lunch specials are $7.50 - 8.50."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,The sesame pancakes are amazing. Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a very long time. Love the spicy eggplant dish too.
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I first tried this place after some friends brought some leftovers. Of course, that isn't necessarily an ideal first experience but the beef tripe and ox tongue was fantastic, so I had to check this place out. My husband and I went after work on a Friday night, so it was busy. The server took a bit to actually come by and acknowledge us, but considering how busy it was, I try to be understanding. Right away I ordered the beef tripe and ox tongue as well as the spicy fried intestines. My husband ordered twice cooked spicy pork. The beef tripe and ox tongue is really interesting to me because first and foremost, it's the first time I've had tripe in a dish other than menudo. My husband was really put off by the fact that it  was not served hot, but still liked the flavor. I believe it was supposed to be served that way, at least from what I remember my friends telling me. The best part of the meal was the spicy fried intestines, hands down. I've had beef intestines before (tacos de tripa con cilantro y cebolla, yum), but these were pork so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were AMAZING. Served up sliced in a big pile with a lot of red chilies, they had a nice crisp on the outside and the inside was soft and juicy. The flavor was different from beef intestine, similar but a little bit like tripe. I don't really know how to describe it. Oh my god, it has to be the best thing I've had in a while. EAT THEM. NOW."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"very poor chicken quality, about what you get at asian kitchen in terms of not wanting to look inside a piece"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Mediocre Chinese restaurant in Madison. Cliff and I came here for a cheat meal after a long cleanse. 

We ordered the black pepper deep fried chicken, garlic eggplant, and a seafood soup. 

The chicken was very disappointing; normally, chinese restaurants fry this chicken dish by the whole, but Fugu skimped out. They gave us the nasty little  parts of the chicken (including cartilage and god knows what else), heavily battered them, and fried them - so each bite consisted of crunchy dough and oil. A few pieces into the dish I started to question if they were even serving me actual chicken. 

The seafood soup was a miss. It was heavily salted and tasted as if they dumped frozen seafood inside an msg loaded broth. 

The eggplant was the only decent dish. I tasted sweet chili sauce more than anything else (didn't taste the garlic at all, so the name was misleading). Though it actually made me want to finish my rice. 

Aside from everything else, I feel like Fugu needs to chill with the red chili peppers and hot chili oil. They drench that in every single goddamn dish that when you finish and look at the plate, you realize that half of it consisted of red peppers."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,Try the steamed dumplings and the chicken fried rice. Everything was delicious but those two dishes were particularly tasty.
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"One of the best Chinese food resto I've had in the States. Not so oily. It also offers a wide variety of the dishes including hot pot and spicy noodles. Decent price that a college student like me can come a few times a week. The decoration and ambience is nice too. Just wish that they had more space because the waiting time is always like 15 mins before we can have the food.

I'm surprised that Madison has such a good place."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"It's ""Asian fusion."" So yes, Fugu is suffering from an identity crisis. But I come for the Szechuan food and it is spicy, authentic, and delicious."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"This place is pretty decent, but the food is kind of expensive for what you get. I got an eggplant chicken dish and my boyfriend got a pork belly dish. It was all decent, but I think I would go somewhere else before returning here."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I'm a big fan of Chinese food and usually love everything I eat but this place is the exception. I went with a group of 12 people and the service was just not in sync. Not only did it take upwards to an hour to receive the food, but after the first meal was delivered, it took roughly 30 minutes for all the food to finally trickle to the table. Also, many appetizers were delivered long after entrees reached the table. 

As for the food, I ordered General Tso's Chicken. When I finally got my food, I found the balls of chicken to appear very large, however, I was quite disappointed when I ate it. The sauce was nice, it was sweet and had a touch of heat, but there was barely any chicken at all. Many times, there was no chicken in each ball and on the off chance that there was, it was just a tiny piece that was covered by a lot more batter. I essentially ate balls of batter with rice. 

I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants and although I recommend many to friends, this place is not one of them."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,Authentic hot spicy Chinese food. Hot pot with dried chile is great. Good service.  Not your typical midwest Chinese food.  And to find this in Madison is more amazing.  Don't let the name throw you-- it was probably a Japanese restaurant in an earlier life--but now really Chinese.  Forget the Thai food that's also on the menu.
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"After all the talk I heard about bad Chinese food after coming to Madison, I was scared I was going to be SOL in terms of good food.  This place flips it on its head though.  We got Shredded Beef with Spicy Capsicum, pork shortribs, and some chicken hotpot.  All awesome, all spicy, and plenty of food for the four of us to go around.  Big enough space that you're not sitting on top of each other as well."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"The location of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being located on State St right on campus, it's definitely popular amongst students especially. They serve good Sze Chuan food, which means that the majority of the dishes will be cooked with spicy oil -- making them spicy. 

Their menu actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I order and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus, there are many reviews of Fugu out here with good recommendations on what to get, so I will talk more about the experience and service here. 

Went to lunch once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the lunch specials, which was a good deal coming to about $10. It has a set consisting of the main course, a soup and fruits to go with it. Most of their sets are served in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For dinner you just order off their menu.

Service wise, it's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your main course dishes might come before or together with your appetizers. On some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your order. But they are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. 

I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting area and ample parking. Between one or the other it all boils down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan dishes =)"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"The place is clean and and cozy. The staff are friendly and prompt. The food however is something to be desired. I had the crab Rangoon, honey walnut shrimp, and salt and pepper calamari. The crab Rangoon's breading seems too floury. The walnut shrimp had really cheap breading that almost seems corn dog like with a watery sauce that is supposed to be thick. The salt and pepper squid seems to be made with old oil, and the breading again seems too floury. Maybe I'm just used to Chicago china town food, but I was disappointed."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Okay, Fugu, I'm sorry for taking such a long time to write a review for you, while I may be referred as a regular, by yelp standard. First time I came here was to have my own welcoming party held by my professor, supervisor and my new friends. Apparently, all of them have been regulars here for years so they ordered: the chicken with chillies (Sechuan style), fried tofu, and spicy fried fish, right away without any hesitation. They are all spicy and served our Indonesian tastebuds just right: we are all spicy eater. My American professor would only take a small portion, as it was too spicy for her. But, she liked it.  Other times, hubby and I would try their lamb stew- again, spicy but delectable.
In all, our meal experiences at Fugu have been always warm and nice. 
It's good, tho we all know, there should be some MSG involved."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,Definitely will go back...best wonton soup I've ever had. I got the Pai Thai which my waitress said was the same as Pad Thai however I was not a fan....it was very soupy and tasted a little like barbecue sauce honestly. I would not get that again but I tried my friends food and everything else was delicious! Seemed very authentic.
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"My friend received a recommendation from a colleague and we decided to try this place on a rainy afternoon. We were the only patrons for most of our meal which led to the waitress staring at us while we ate our food. I ordered pad thai and the waitress proceeded to question my choice and asked me more than once if I knew what it was. I was fairly insulted. My friend ordered king pao chicken and veggie potstickers. The food came quickly with the potstickers being first. The dumplings weren't steamed long enough and tasted raw. My lunch combo box with the pad thai included a spring roll that was 95 percent wrapper, a Japanese style salad that was very watery, orange slices that were the best part of the meal, and the main dish that was disgusting. The sauce on the noodles was incredibly sweet and there weren't any raw veggies to add texture. I couldn't eat most of it and I am not a picky eater.  I sure hope that people who go there have a much better experience than we did. I certainly will never return."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I went here for lunch with a couple of friends.  First of all, I must agree with Lan that the space is MUCH more appealing than you would guess from outside, and the restrooms deserve a special note of their own--single occupant and I'm not kidding, they are beautifully decorated.  The overall ambiance was very nice.

For the meal, we shared the steamed dumplings and my friends had Sichuan dishes with pork and tofu, respectively, while I had the Thai basil noodles with chicken.  Madison is sadly lacking in Chinese food, but I would say we finally have a decent place in town for at least some traditional specialties.  The Sichuan menu items are appropriately spicy and my friends liked them a lot.  My Thai basil noodles with chicken were DELICIOUS.  My only complaint is that the sauce was a bit overly greasy, which one friend said was also an issue with his spicy garlic sauce, but it wasn't overwhelmingly so and we agreed that in both dishes, the flavor was still very good.

The steamed dumplings were serviceable although not particularly rave-worthy.  (Then again, their competition at the meal was fierce.)  The entree portions were large; I tend to pig out, but many people probably could have made two meals of them.

We also had hot tea, which was promptly refilled by our waitress as we ate (admittedly it wasn't very busy at 11:45 or so when we were there).  I really like green tea, and the flavor of Fugu's house tea is lovely--a bit bolder than Takara's, I would say, which I also like, but not too strong to enjoy with a meal.

I gave them $$ for price because many of the entrees are in the $10-15 range, but they have a lunch menu with a range of $8-10 specials.  Not at all expensive for the quantity and quality of the food, in my opinion.  You should note, however, that there is a $15 minimum for credit cards."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"After being disappointed by the lackluster turnout for Go Topless day, we headed to Fugu for a late lunch.  We opted for some small dishes to fill the gaping void in me left from last night's festivities.

I ordered the Sichuan Pork Wontons in chili oil and Hot & Sour soup. The wontons arrived fully submerged in a sea of slightly spicy oil. While it seemed a little excessive, the wontons were delicious. The combination of both was just what I needed to fill me up.

Pro tip: skip out on the General Tso's and order from the Sichuan menu section. Chicken with Spicy and Sour Garlic Sauce is always on point."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I've never given a restaurant one star before. I would actually give it a quarter star but my son did like his tom yum soup broth.   Note, broth only. 

Sunday dinner, which is usually nice. Decided to try someplace new for Chinese food, as Madtown has so few good choices and we had not had any in a while.

We had four dishes and soup. All were pretty bad. 

Crab Rangoon - soft wontons through, very little filling, greasy on bottom. Served with so little sauce it was very noticeable. 

Five flavor beef - so full of gristle it was almost inedible. We picked around gristle to at least give it a chance. Flavor was just ok, green inion on plate was slimy. 

Cold chicken in chili sauce. Looked thrown together. Smothered in chili oil. Slimy mess, although the chicken seemed fresh as I was lucky and got a pin feather in mine. (Note - I don't want to know if it was NOT a pin feather.)

Pork with mustard noodles. Pork was very gamey in an unpleasant way. Bland otherwise. Gelatinous.  Noodles were slimy and way over cooked.  

My hot and sour soup was a greasy gelatinous mess. 

I hate to say it, but the common adjectives of most of the dishes were ""greasy"", ""slimy"", over-oily, or ""gelatinous"", nine if which were in a good way. 

Will avoid this place. Recommend you do too. 

Sad, as we really hoped for a good Chinese place. 

Oops - almost forgot - and the prices were high end for Chinese food, in an environment that was also greasy. Ah well."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I had the Kung Pao Chicken, Dan dan noodles and the spring rolls. I loved everything. 
The kung pao had big pieces of chicken, peppers, zuchini, onions and bamboo shoots with a thick rich brown spicy sauce. 
The spring rolls were delivered still-hot and were great. Fried to a crisp and the sweet and sour was excellent. 
I ordered the dan dan noodles because a Chinese friend of mine used to make them for us  at his dinner parties. This came as a huge portion (as was the entree). Thin square noodles covered with ground pork sauce. Hot and tangy in a way its hard to describe, but delicious. I will definitely have their food again and maybe explore some of the more adventurous menu items."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"We walked in and were greeted promptly by a hostess who took us to our table and gave us the menus to peruse. There are a lot of options including your typical American Chinese like Mongolian Beef or Orange Chicken as well as more exotic dishes like tripe, ox-tail, kidney, or intestine. When our waitress returned we ordered sake as well as 'Steamed White Meat Chicken with Chili Oil Sauce', 'Three Threads Salad', 'Sliced Lamb with Black Pepper', and 'Sauteed Baby Octopus with Pickled Pepper'. 

The chicken is an appetizer and appetizer priced, but you get a lot of chicken. It is served cold and has the skin on. It was our favorite dish. Both spicy and sweet, very tender, I absolutely loved this and will order it every time I go back. Like a lot of Chinese food it is practically floating in oil, but it was so good.

The Three Thread Salad is also an appetizer, also a good deal, and also delicious. It includes seaweed, bean noodle, and radish. Spicy and incredible. The flavors and textures were spot on and I would highly recommend this dish.

The lamb with black pepper was not what we were expecting. It was floating in a lot of oil. It contained blackened chopped spicy red peppers and there were dozens (hundreds?) of them. The flavor of the lamb and the sauce was incredible. I think it also had cilantro in it. However, the spicy blackened peppers were everywhere and although I love spicy food I could not eat them, so I had to pick out the beef which was a challenge with that many chopped peppers. Great flavor, but I would not order this dish again as it was just too much work.

The baby octopus dish was also delicious. Hot and spicy, with some vegetables I did not recognize. Some of the octopus were not as tender as I might like, but this was another very tasty dish.

We really enjoyed the flavors and textures of all the dishes we tried. The peppers made the lamb challenging to eat. Next time we go, we'll probably just do appetizers since they are nearly the same size as the entrees but only 1/2 the price.

I definitely recommend Fugu!"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"This is a surprise in Madison where much of the food is bland or has been watered down for non-Asian tastebuds. One of the best authentic Asian restaurants in Madison. 

Started with ox tongue and tripe. A cold but spicy dish with two things I normally stay away from. The flavor and texturesof this dish are amazing. There is the soft tender tongue with loads of spicy flavor contrasted by the tripe which had a slight crunch when you bite into it"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Being in Madison for a couple of years, I'm pretty sure that if you want delicious and authentic Chinese food, this place is as good as it gets! They have many very authentic Chinese dishes you don't see very much elsewhere. I love the poached sliced beef in hot chilli sauce and the fish fillet dishes, they're delicious! Everything else I've tried here are all really great. The food can be really spicy, but you can always ask them to make it more mild. 

The servers are always really friendly and helpful. The restaurant gets pretty busy on the weekends, but I think it's worth the wait.

The food is a bit pricey, ranging from $10 to $15 per dish, but  the portions are big and it's not that bad if you share the dishes. One little down side is that they charge extra for rice. 

I highly recommend this place!"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night because Hong Kong Wok closes at 6pm.  Upon entering, it looks a lot more appealing than from the outside of the restaurant.

I went with a roommate and we shared three dishes: twice cooked pork ($13), ma po tofu ($11), and chicken with Sichuan sauce($9).  We both got orders of steamed rice, which cost an extra dollar per portion.

The twice cooked pork had some sort of bacon-type meat which was enjoyable with the green onion and while hot but less so as it became cooler.  The tofu was excellent a generous spicy sauce that probably included numbing pepper.  And the chicken was tender and the vegetables cooked just right.  The rice was fresh.

I definitely recommend Fugu if you're looking for spicy, well sauced Chinese/Szechuan dishes.  All the dishes were made to order and came out hot and delicious, though more expensive than your typically-priced Chinese dishes.  The service is also quite nice.  Next time I'll have to try some of their other ethnic cuisines.

A 15% gratuity was included, however, but I did not considering how good the food and polite the staff were."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"The menu is huge here and you'd likely have to go to Fugu several times before discovering your favorite items. My favorite dish here is the sliced fish with sweet and sour sauce. I've never had anything as similar and as tasty as this. The cumin beef and the twice cooked slice pork are also great choices here. Not sure why, but I also really like their spicy string beans.

In addition, ordering for takeout at Fugu is pretty convenient. I've never seen such a great set up for an Asian restaurant. You can order online and there is usually a discount for doing it this way. Just check out Fugu's website.

Your best and closest bet for good, authentic Chinese food in Madison would be Fugu. There is no close second."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Try popcorn chicken,deep fried intestine and their spicy fish fillet,da bomb!!!!!"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"We had the Kung Pao chicken and General Tso's chicken. Kung Pao was pretty Americanized-- slightly sweet, no spiciness, but a good texture. Portion size was average, not giant but not small. For ~$11 it wasn't as good as I had hoped. A good peanut to chicken ratio though.

General Tso was typical General Tso... neon colored, sweet chunks of chicken to tame the Chinese takeout desire. Again, at $10.50, it was on the high side. Not the best I've had, but not the worst. 

Service was fast and efficient. Probably won't go back unless I want some authentic Sichuan- as the American-style offerings were pretty mediocre."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,Absolutely love this place!  As others said stick to the real asian cuisine here and this place is awesome!  I personally love the Braised Beef hot pot.  It is not overly spicy and has really great flavor.  As a regular to this establishment I receive extremely good service.  The last 4 or 5 times I was here my food came out in what seemed like less than 5 minutes and was perfect while the restaurant was full!
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Fugu has excellent reviews, it is within walking distance of my crib, and it is packed to brimming with Chinese students.  They only serve chopsticks unless you ask for silverware.  They have huge tables for a large crowd with a round serving tray in the middle that spins so people can take a bit of everything and share their meals conveniently.  

I ordered the Cumin crusted lamb, and spicy green beans.  I really was not impressed.  The beans were super salty, and the lamb dried up with the overwhelmingly Cumin flavor.  

I will try again, this place has gotten far too many kudos, and is far too busy for it to be just me.  Next time I'll order something different and let you know how it goes."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"My husband and I went to Fugu for a late lunch.  We were promptly seated and given menus.  The menu has many dishes which sound amazing.  We got a couple apps and 2 entrées.  The sesame pancakes and dan dan noodles were so good.  My husband got the Singapore noodles which had a wonderful, spicy curry flavor.  I got the chicken with spicy and sour sauce.  The sauce was very tasty.  Overall, it was a great experience and would go again.  My fav Asian restaurant so far."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Hands down my favorite Asian restaurant in Madison:

Let me start by saying that I am not of Chinese decent, nor have I ever traveled to China,  but I have a feeling that this is what authentic Chinese cuisine tastes like. Every time I walk in there, the place is PACKED with people chatting in Mandarin over big family-style dishes. Furthermore, it is SO SO SO much better than any ""Americanized"" Chinese food I've ever had. 

My favorite part about this place is definitely the sichuan pepper dishes. They are an extremely difficult ingredient to get your hands on if you don't have access to an Asian foods market, but they're absolutely delicious (and spicy to boot)! Favorites of mine include sichuan cucumber salad and sichuan eggplant, but the pickled pepper dishes look fabulous as well! Everything on the ""regular"" (not ""American-Style"") menu here that is advertised as ""spicy"" is ACTUALLY spicy, which I love! The food is bursting with flavor and these dishes make it easy to understand why Chinese fare is typically served with WHITE (not fried) rice: the rice soaks up all of the delicious juices and becomes one of the most flavorful components of the meal.

Speaking of rice, the rice here is PHENOMENAL and is cooked to perfection (both white and fried). For all of you naysayers out there who think that rice can't be done ""wrong,"" you're mistaken. Fried rice lovers, take one bite of the fried rice at FUGU and you will understand that every other Chinese place you've ever been to has cooked their rice to a lower standard. Here, it is soft, fluffy, flavorful, and just slightly sticky. YUM. It's the best fried rice I've ever had. 

Like most Asian restaurants, the selection is huge and there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options (vegan PRO TIP: try the garlic eggplant--out of this world! Just make sure to spread the spicy oils over your rice). I have yet to venture out and try some of the REALLY authentic dishes (tripe, ox tongue, etc), but some of the borderline-authentic stuff has come up short for me (in particular, the pork dumplings with chili oil--I couldn't stomach them). I've also gone in the opposite direction: the ""American Style"" menu is expansive, but FUGU does NOT do American Chinese food well (shame on them for being TOO authentic--lol). There is a consistent lack of spice and flavor with every dish I've tried on that menu (although the quality of products is still supreme). I think it best to stick with the ""middle ground"" of the menu here. 

Overall, give FUGU a shot, and you won't be disappointed (at least not for carry out; I've never dined in)."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I think I may have just found the one.

It was a late Saturday afternoon, and we were preparing for the copious amount of alcohol we were about to consume that night.

Knowing that the best way to not get completely trashed was food in our bellies, my friends and I set out on a quest to find some alcohol buffer. 

After going through countless takeout menus online, we finally settled on Fugu. Having never heard about this place before, our expectations were pretty low.

First of all, the Chinese food in Madison is crap, period (Sorry Madisonians(?), just being honest).

Second, this place is located right off of State Street, which is basically drunk haven for college kids.

Third, this place is called Fugu.... and they sell Chinese food. Dictionary.com defines fugu as ""a puffer fish that is eaten as a Japanese delicacy, after some highly poisonous parts have been removed by an authorized chef."" 

So ok, this place is named after a highly poisonous Japanese delicacy, but serves Chinese food... 

Alright then, moving on...

As soon as we opened up the menu, however, I knew we were in for a special treat. My non-Asian roommate couldn't read the menu at all, which is immediately a good sign when it comes to Chinese food.

As I browsed through the list of food, I saw quite a few authentic Chinese dishes that I was so used to back in Boston. 

We ordered the sesame pancakes, Singapore beef noodle, eggplant in garlic sauce and deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper. 

It took roughly ~30 minutes of wait time before the food was delivered right to our doorsteps. The fact that this place delivers AUTHENTIC Chinese food alone should merit 5-stars.

While waiting for our friend to bring up the food, the aromatic scent of delicious Szechuan cuisine wafted through our house, and made our mouths water. The moment the food was set on the table, we went into it like ravenous savages, and devoured the food within minutes.

It was definitely not a pretty sight, but oh was it ever so delicious... I can still taste the soft eggplants with its sweet, garlic sauce. The numbingly spicy chicken with its perfect crusty skin. The thin, dry noodles intervened with tender pieces of beef and vegetables.

Everything about the meal was delicious. I thought I had fallen in love before, but it wasn't until now, that I have realized my naivety. 

Fugu, you're now my number 1 love in Madison."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I've been resisting going to this place for the past several years. The location was previously an 'all you can eat' place called Yummy Buffet.  It's illogical why I resisted.

I went here recently and ordered the cold chicken, eggplant dish, and fried chicken.  Everything tasted amazing, but in particular, I want to say, be open to the cold chicken dish - the briny sauce it was smothered in was a heavenly combination of sweet, tangy, and salty.

I'm definitely coming back here again.  Three dishes came out to $30 or so for two people.  You could also go cheaper and order the lunch bentos."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"So I'm in town on a business trip and sick as a dog. I decided that only some Asian cuisine would do. I ordered fairly simple fare -- Wonton Soup with Garlic Pork Spareribs. The soup was bland with a greasy consistently. The two wontons had a strange texture.. Almost like they'd been boiling for hours. The flavor and texture was unpleasant. Then the Garlic Spareribs were breaded and we're not boneless. I figured this out when I made the mistake of biting into one. It would've been ok if it at least tasted good, but no.  I was really disappointed by the meal. Promising menu, but the food doesn't deliver."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Somehow I have lived a block and a half away from Fugu for three years and never tried it.  Something about the exterior (one prominent sign advising ""No Public Restrooms"" and two more warning of hidden cameras in operation) just turned me off.  That all changed yesterday when my wife and I finally gave it a try.  Oh my God-- absolutely delicious!  I'll get the bad out of the way first-- the restaurant was fairly crowded for 4:00 in the afternoon and only one waiter was working-- there were a lot of tables that hadn't been cleared and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  One of our water glasses was also less than clean.  But I don't even care because the food was A-MA-ZING.  I've been craving a decent hot and sour soup ever since I moved to Madison and they delivered.  The chicken with garlic sauce was perfect.  The waiter (who was extremely nice) warned me about how spicy the fried beef in chili sauce would be and he was right.  It was also delicious.   We've eaten there two days in a row now and will definitely be back.

Edit: I'm downgrading this to four stars.  I've been back a number of times (mostly for takeout) and I'll definitely be going back, but it hasn't worked out to be a five-star performance.  

Two main problems: 1) Consistency: Some things are really, really good and a great value.  Some things are less good (mongolian beef was tough, hunan beef didn't have much beef).  Some things that are often good are sometimes not good (hot and sour soup).  2) Service: Everyone is very nice, but the place just doesn't run well.  They need someone coordinating everything, because the service is slow and out of joint."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Fugu is beyond comparison. Nothing in Madison can touch the quality and variety offered on the extensive and exciting menu. I was reminded of several of my favourite Sichuan places in San Francisco the first time I dined at fugu and I haven't been disappointed since.

MUST TRIES: 

Lamb hot pot. Complete with the famous and addictive ""numbing spice"" (Sichuan peppercorn, hua jiao)

Dry-fried chicken with Sichuan peppercorn

Eggplant in Sichuan sauce

Ma Po Tofu"
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Perhaps one mark of authenticity at Fugu is the fact that a lot of the menu will scare and confuse you. Blood intestine? Bean curd? I have yet to be adventurous enough to try one of these menu items. I instead try to settle on something that resembles your typical Chinese take-out, without going for anything too boring.

I always start a meal here with the spring rolls. They're cooked to a perfect texture, with a thin, crispy outer shell that crunches like a potato chip, and a soft vegetable-filled mush inside. They taste a little bland, but that's easily offset by the great sweet-and-sour sauce served on the side with the spring rolls.

I highly recommend the beef with ginger and scallions as an entree. Whereas most Asian places will overload a dish with vegetables in order to save money on the meat, Fugu has done the exact opposite. I almost missed the vegetables, but the meat is too good for me to care. It's cooked so perfectly, to the point where it practically melts in your mouth. You'll find meat like this in all their beef dishes as well.

On a different occasion, though, I decided to get the fried shredded beef in hot chili sauce, and wasn't as impressed. Once again, the beef was a perfectly-cooked blend of fat and meat that made it taste and feel like beef and butter had a baby. It was cut into thick strips which could hardly be called ""shredded,"" but that was probably for the best. The sauce and spices surrounding the beef, on the other hand, weren't too good. I was warned that the dish was going to be very spicy, but I certainly wasn't expecting to be served a dish that was almost half comprised of chili peppers and ginger. Most of the dish wasn't even edible!

If you do decide to get something simple like the chicken lo mein, you'll be pleased with it. I didn't get anything that goes above and beyond all expectations, but honestly, I don't even know how you could do so with something like chicken lo mein. The lo mein was soft and buttery, with a simple and traditional blend of add-ins. The chicken was good, but nothing special. All in all, it's certainly better than take-out.

The prices here are slightly higher than normal, but you do get a noticeable step up in quality that justifies it. Furthermore, the portions are huge. Unless you plan on taking home leftovers, you should probably just buy one entree per two people.

The service is consistently a problem.  It is somewhat slow, even when the restaurant is empty. Requests for things like condiments are often ignored or unanswered for long periods of time. This is due in part to the fact that most of Fugu's staff has very poor English. It's very irritating that I can't have menu items explained to me because myself and the waiter can't even understand one another. You can put whoever you want in your kitchen, but it's unacceptable to put out a wait staff that can't communicate with the customers."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"I really just didn't like it that much. The Pad Thai was like Sweet and Sour instead of Peanut Sauce, and the curry was waaay salty. On the bright side, the Mouchi was really good, and you should definitely get it. This isn't the best town for Asian food, but you can do better. I'd recommend Vientiane (or something similar to that). The service was quick (almost too quick) and the staff very friendly."
Fugu,7. chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce lunch special,"Food here is excellent.  Like a previous reviewer noted, where there is a red pepper on the menu, the dish is spicy.  Not too spicy to enjoy, mind you, but you'll want lots of water.  The only real knock against this place is the service.  Everyone is nice enough but very slow and hard to get wait staff's attention for something.  Relatedly, it is very crowded on weekend nights.  But really worth it for the delicious cuisine."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I have to say, the menu at Fugu looks pretty similar to the menu at Ichiban. My boyfriend and I ordered the garlic eggplant and the baby octopus with pickled peppers from the house specials. We both loved the octopus dish, which was savory and spicy. The garlic eggplant was a bit on the oily side, with a one-dimensional flavor. We were also seated near an air vent, and it felt too hot the whole time we were there. 5 stars for the octopus, 2 stars for the eggplant, and 1 star for the heating situation."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"If I were to name three restaurants in Madison I can't live without, Fugu would be one of them!  Pleasant ambiance, good service and DELICIOUS food! 

Their 'pork dumplings' are undoubtedly the best I have ever had. And the taste is consistent no matter what time of the day. I would strongly recommend their 'Chicken with spicy and sour Garlic sauce'. It is unlike any Chinese Chicken dish I have ever had in or outside Madison. Their fried fish is also very delicious.

A must-try for even someone who does not like chinese food. You might just change your mind after going to Fugu!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"A group of friends and I came here after a day of snowboarding craving some spicy food. This place is by far the most authentic Szechuan restaurant I've been to. I'm not joking, Fugu would seriously destroy other Chinese restaurants if they decide to move to Chicago Chinatown. 

We ordered 2 cold appetizers and 5 entrees for 5 of us. I'm not sure if the waiting was truly long,  or we just felt like it because we were in a room full of spicy aroma. But once they started serving the dishes, it was really fast, we had all our 7 plates in 10min. We started with two very traditional dishes, pepper shredded tripe and ox tongue and tripe, which I always use to test the authenticity of a Szechuan restaurant. Fugu definitely passed my test. Everyone suddenly stopped talking and quietly enjoyed the texture and the flavor. 

The house-special steamed lamb pot was really good and I also loved the crispy chili (haven't had it for years and I found it here!). I was a little bit disappointed with the poached beef, fish with pickled chili and spicy aromatic pig blood tofu. They were good, but they just didn't meet the high expectations I built up after the cold appetizers and first two dishes. I can't explain what was it, but there was something missing in their flavor, maybe it needs to a little bit more complexity of spicy and sour? 

The waiter was very friendly and he asked for our suggestions and even apologized for ""letting us down"" with some of the dishes. I gave Fugu a solid 4 stars and I will definitely revisit this place. If you love authentic Chinese food, Fugu is the place to go!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"4 stars for one of two most authentic Chinese restaurants in town!
4 stars for the only Chinese restaurant specializing in Sezchuan foods.
5 stars for the o-so-spicy-it-makes-your-mouth-drooling-and-your-eyes-teary spicy fried chicken (other recommended menu includes tofu and mushroom in white sauce, spicy dandan noodle, and spicy wonton)
3 stars for the fish with spicy sauce, cold tripe/tendon.
3 stars for the relatively expensive price"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Went tonight for my birthday dinner. 
We ordered the Sichuan Cucumbers, the Fish with Golden Peppers, and the Fried Chicken stir-fried with dried chilis. We had a Mango, and a Pineapple smoothie to drink.
Absolutely phenomenal! Everything was delicious. 
We will definitely return."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"This is the beginning of a new love affair. A Chinese coworker brought me here after work last week stating this is the most authentic in Madison, and after scanning through their menu which included kidneys and intestines, I was beginning to feel a bit giddy. 

The flavor in my Lao Gan Ma twice cooked pork tasted just like the ones I've had in Chinatowns and I've visited ALL the chinatowns in this country. I loved the sauce so much that I poured my rice into the plate at the end and gobbled up every last drop of that delicious greasiness. 

The only complaint I have is their dining room being too dark and too cold. I mean, the food really isn't SO spicy that you would feel the need for icy air to cool down. So minus one star for ambience. 

I will be back. Possibly tomorrow and every week after."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,The most authentic Chinese food in Madison! I have searched long and hard for the food I learned to love when I lived in China 10 years ago and Fugu delivers. Must haves are the spicy twice cooked sliced pork ( pork belly) and the sezchaun spicy wontons... Enjoy
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Normally not a fan of Chinese, this was much better than most I've had. (And that's a compliment coming from me).  This place was bustling at 7:30pm on a Friday night but our carryout order was on time.  I was lucky enough to have someone with me so we could double-park, otherwise you may struggle to pick up your food as this is right off of State St.

I ordered the veggies & shittake mushroom (added tofu, a girl needs her protein, for $1,50).  Glad I did as the ""veggies"" otherwise were simply bok choy and shittakes.   The veggies were plump, flavorful, and fresh. The tofu was lightly fried and not too greasy. The sauce wasn't too heavy but also was on the bland side, it could have used a bit more flavor (not spice, I'm talkin' flavor here),  The Kung Pao chicken got rave reviews at our house for being delicious and not too greasy (take note other Chinese restaurants, you're tooooo greeeeeeasy).  The steamed veggie dumplings ($4.50) were perfectly fine, but nothing I'd write home about.  

All in all, if we were to order Chinese carryout again, this would be the place."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Having read an article about Fugu in either Madison Magazine or Madison Originals, I was very excited to try an authentic restaurant. 

And yet sadly, Fugu disappoints. The interior ambiance is fine... nothing special, but decent. 

The food I had was just disappointing. On my first visit, I tried an order of the pan-fried noodles, which I had expected to be crispy. They were not even close to what I had come to expect from Chicago's Chinatown. This might have been ok if they weren't also unbearably garlicky and salty, so much so that no amount of water would have satiated the thirst I got from eating the meal. My husband fared slightly better with the pad thai lunch box, but he wasn't a huge fan, either. On my second visit, I tried a Massaman curry lunch box. I was much happier with this option, as the flavors were good, and the vegetables included were some of my favorites. However, when I actually put the curry sauce on my rice (rather than just pulling the veggies out of the sauce), I realized that the sauce had a gritty/sandy texture that was quite unpleasant on my teeth. 

Most importantly, the service was extremely slow. My second visit was over lunch on a work day, and we couldn't even catch the waitress' eye to get more water or anything else we needed. After a good 35-45 minutes of no attention whatsoever, we had to head back to work. Thankfully, we had cash, so without ever receiving the check, we were able to leave the appropriate amount of money on the table and leave. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"As far as Chinese food goes, this is the best in Madison, which is why it gets 5 stars.  The only other comparable location is Ichiban Szechuan, and that restaurant is more oily and less flavorful.

The style here is mostly from southern China--most dishes are spicy, and there are very few vegetarian options (though the vegetarian options are delicious as well).

One thing to note is that their 'hotpot' dishes aren't what you'd expect of 'huo guo'.  These are mostly dry dishes kept heated over a flame.  Worth a try if you're curious.

They have 'Americanized' menu items which tend to be a little too sweet.  I would recommend getting anything with a Chinese name next to it. 

Items I usually get:
Mapo Tofu
Spicy twice cooked fish
Cumin lamb
Hot and sour soup

The service is usually fast, but can be slow on busier days."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"This place has the spicy Chinese food i've been craving for. They got some American Chinese food but mostly true authentic Chinese food you don't see much. This is the only reason you should go here for and order. I bet most people are brained washed thinking that Chinese buffet restaurants are true Chinese food. The young unwise me was once.

When I first arrived I had to wait out front alone for a few minutes before someone finally came out of the kitchen. Put after that service was on. Friendly and helpful. Their was only one other couple in the place the whole time I was there on a Monday night.

They have two menu ""books"". Took me awhile to figure out what to order even thou I had looked over their menu online a little bit.

First dish to arrive was the Spicy Green Beans. Crisps bite with slices of garlic and chucks of dry chilies. Greasier than I would of liked. Huge pool of oil on the bottom of plate. Had a kick to it but nothing compared to the next dish. The Mapo Tofu. Mouth on fire, nose running, the way I like it good. Chili oil, minced pork, scallions, szechuan pepper, and tofu. Hard to eat with chopsticks. The side of rice was excellent to soak up all the liquid.
 
No buffet here. But great place to get a group of friends together and order a huge amount of plates to get a wide tasting of their menu."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Fugu has been one of my bigger disappointments in Madison dining, because i've heard both my friend and yelp peers give big ups to it, but my experiences here have really failed to meet expectations. All of the times i've been here, i've noticed two trends: Bland entrees, and slow service.

With regard to the entrees: Some reviews on here are claiming that some of the dishes are great, so maybe i'm just ordering the wrong things. But, I got a mushroom dish, and an assortment of veggie dishes, and all of those left a lot to be desired. The mushroom dish had some spice, but the mushroom texture was inconsistent, so it wasn't too great. The veggies were often just the veggie in question with some rice, sometimes in a tasteless sauce. It didn't feel like anything that I couldn't have made at home easily.

As for the service, it's just often really slow. Slow for them to seat you, slow to take your order, slow for them to fill up your water (which really sucks if you get a spicy dish and you're a spice wimp like myself), and slow for them to get your bill. I went at times that were only semi-crowded, but regardless it didn't seem like it should have been taking so long. They could benefit from adding another wait staff to take orders at peak hours.

My experience as Fugu hasn't been all bad, though. Note that I only mentioned the entrees being bland. I've had some pretty excellent appetizers, such as the Sesame cakes, which came with a very awesome savory sauce. I'd definitely be willing to try Fugu again, but only if I had a lot of free time that night, and a very good tip from someone on what to order."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"My fiance loves this place to death. I have tried about 10 dishes here in hopes of finding one that I will like enough to be happy when he wants to order Fugu instead of switching into clever-ploys-to-do-something-other-than-Fugu mode.

I can't put my finger on it, exactly, but everything seems to be too much or too little of too many things. Too spicy, too greasy, too bland, too many bones I have to pick out. It's like that dish that you cook for yourself at home and when you go to taste it you think oh dang, this isn't very good but I made it so I might as well eat it. But you don't really want to feel that way about takeout that you get all the time, you know?"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I've been here several times, mostly it was ok, but sometimes there's no service.
Or the service you got is their stare.

2 things I don't like about this place is,

--I like/cook Chinese food, but when dining out, its oily feature always concerns me.  I therefore have to use extra 2 bowls for getting rid of excessive oil/salt, otherwise my body can't take it.
I got stares several times. Even more when I asked the 2nd bowl, having to walk over to the counter while waitress chatting, 5 people in the restaurant.
--I like seafood but the fish with tofu in spicy sauce is not fresh at all. I live in coastal area before so could tell the difference very well. The fish they use is definitely frozen ones.  15.95 for frozen fish doesn't get my business.

Having said that, it's pretty good flavor with most dishes we try, and relatively inexpensive. In terms of service, how would I say? It's just a very Chinese way, meaning if you say thank you to them they ignore you.  Having have to go to the counter to pay yourself. We've lived in HK before and literally got shoutings from them so know what it's like (but of course never like it). Guess in Chinese culture restaurant is about food, not service.

Last time I paid tips with lower percentage. The lady looked kinda disappointed. Hey, same here. How do I know the tips go to people serving me?"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Really awesome authentic chinese food.  Entrees average around 15 dollars, def not a cheap chinese place at all, in price or quality.  The sweet and sour fish is delicious.  On of the  best places to get fresh fish in madison, as they often have live fish in tanks just waiting to be eaten!  I work at a hotel in town and I always reccomend this place to our Chinese guests, one man loved the restaurant so much he went every night during his week long stay, and literally thanked me on a daily basis with a big smile for recommending this place to him. Anyone who hates on this place doesnt know authentic chinese food."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I ended up going twice in a week.  Interesting mix of Chinese-American and ""real"" Szechuan.  You get two menus, one of which is really large.  Huge variety of food to choose from.

On the first visit, I went with a vegetarian friend and there were lots of options for her.  After reading reviews, we ordered the sesame pancakes, which were good, but they were like deep fried roti with sesame on them.  They didn't taste very Chinese-y but were tasty.  Greasy but tasty.

We shared the Ma Po tofu and still didn't finish it all - really good dish - spicy (not too much) and a lot of flavor.

On my second trip I ordered the Kung Pao chicken, recommended by another friend.  The waitress asked which one I wanted - there was an American-Chinese style and a Szechuan version.  I got the Szechuan version.  You know those red chili peppers in a lot of spicy Chinese dishes?  There were a ton and chopped up so if you don't like eating them (like me, I love them in the food for flavor but they give me massive heartburn), you have to pick out a lot of them.  The chicken was deliciously cooked - perfectly tender and also had slices of garlic and I think some ginger.  Of course, there was a generous supply of peanuts.

They also have some interesting dishes like fried spicy intestines that I wanted to try but wimped out."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Yum.  In town visiting a friend and came here by chance, I ordered the pan fried noodles (asked for them to be spicy!) and my friend ordered the kung pao chicken. We both loved our food, and my friend has decided to definitely come here more often now! FYI that the pop comes in cans."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"My coworker and I found this on Yelp while in town on a client trip. I had been specifically looking for a great Thai option. We have some thai in Iowa City (one pretty good one) but I figured there'd be something outstanding in Madison. We were not disappointed. I have eaten thai from sea to shining sea and I honestly thing\k the masaman sauce here was the best I have ever had. Modest interior - nice/chintzy-casual, accessible and obviously in a student area. Coldplay's latest album rotated twice while we were there which added to the experience for me. Good prices. And, again, really really good. I left with the ""thai glow."" :-)"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Fugu has been my ""go to"" for ""authentic"" Chinese food for a while but I do have some complaints.

The boiled beef is traditionally supposed to come in a spicy broth but at Fugu, it comes with a syrupy, spicy sauce. It tasted fine but it wasn't what I was expecting, especially since I know that I've had the authentic version here in the past. When I mentioned it to my waitress, she just told me that the brothy version is what they do in China, but at Fugu, this syrupy, saucy dish is how they make it.

Other than that, the food is fine. It's actually pretty good. The prices are definitely steeper than some of the other Chinese places around State but if you're looking for good ""authentic"" Chinese food at a sit down restaurant, Fugu is your still best choice."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Ah, what can I say. Seems like a very popular option amongst international UW Chinese students who wants a taste of home, as it is in a very convenient location and the food quality is as authentic as it gets here in Madison.

Food - on our visit, we had the ox tripe and tongue appetizer along with sliced chicken in garlic sauce (classic Chinese dish but replacing pork with chicken) and shredded pork in bean sauce. Food was great but we should've went with a veggie dish instead of meat on top of meat. Spiciness is my thing and this place quenched my desire for spicy Chinese food. 

Service - compared to the food, service is lacking. After we were seated  no waiters came to our table for the next 15 minutes. I had to tell the person up front that we're still waiting to order. After we were finished, it took another 10-15 to give us the check, we were thinking of just walking out without paying :P

Price - if you're really desperate to eat authentic Chinese, the price isn't a factor. But compared to most Chinese eateries, this is definitely on the pricier side. For 1 appetizer and 2 dishes and tips, we paid close to $40. But the serving size makes up for the price since it took me 3 more meals before I finished all the leftovers :)

Will definitely be coming back whenever the urge to have spicy Chinese food comes back!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"My first time here. The space is rather barren and visually unappealing. I started by ordering one of their interesting-looking sake varieties by the glass, only to find out they are now served by the bottle only (at $20 and up). I went with the Ozeki, and the server didn't bother to unscrew the cap for me. I ordered wonton soup and the seafood and eggplant hotpot.  The soup broth was hot and savory, and the wontons meaty. The ""hotpot"" was served before I was halfway done with soup. It was more like a tureen, and the food color matched Fugu's interior - yellowish green and brown. A large portion of eggplant and not so much seafood, just a few small shrimp, scallops, calamari and krabmeat, served with basic rice. The sauce was fine but calamari was tough. I imagine they focus more on carryouts judging by the disinterested wait staff and constantly ringing phone. I won't be back."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"One of my favorite places in Madison. Right off state street, awesome assortment of really authentic Chinese foods. Pineapple fried tofu, fish with dried chili peppers. Mmm."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Pretty decent place, especially for college students. Great for large groups and people who are not that picky about Asian food. We usually come here with a group of around 10 people and have never had trouble getting a table. I like the mapo tofu and some of the meat dishes. We also had a soup, but for next time, I would stick with the mapo tofu, meats, and eggplants. I think if I had ordered more ""orange chicken"" type of dishes, I would be less satisfied."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"The sichuan food is excellent. We ordered dan dan noodles, fried fish with peppers, and homestyle beef. The dan dan noodles were okay, but unremarkable. The fish, however, was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and the dried and Sichuan flower peppers are still making my stomach and tongue tingle. The beef had tons of peppers of different types; pickled, dried, flower, and more. This meal was certainly delicious and memorable."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"the food here is spicy Chinese food, quite traditional and the price is OK. me and my friend ordered tofu fish, cumin lamb, and pork(""hui guo rou"" in Chinese). The fish is not fresh, I can tell from the taste, the lamb is flavored so much that doesn't taste like lamb, and the pork is weirdly sweet. The dishes are big and we two can only finish half of them. In total it is $45. If you are not so picky about taste as I do, it is still a good place where you can have a decent Chinese dinner with friends."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Oh Fugu, I used to HATE spicy food and now I'm falling in love with them. It's usually always crowded in Fugu, and most of their food are spicy. Here are what I usually order:

Lamb Cumin
Spicy String Bean
Mapo Tofu
Fried Crunchy Pork Intestine
Braised Beef in Hot Pot

If you're not used to spicy food at all, be seriously prepared. I cannot imagine how many pounds of chilies they order every day to cook their food."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I wish Fugu was more than it is.  It's not horrible, but it's not particularly good either.  I was there with a friend and I ordered pork and beancurd in a garlic sauce, which I know the name of in Chinese, but the translation they had on the menu is probably not the best.  

The sauce wasn't particularly good.  It was spicy like it should be but too thick and gelatinous.  My dish was smothered in it and I couldn't really taste anything but the garlic sauce.  I think this is the same garlic sauce that they use in several of their dishes.  The pork and beancurd was more like a vehicle for mediocre sauce.  

Growing up in LA though, I may be spoiled by my idea of good Chinese food and this doesn't even begin to compare with the myriad of options in LA.  If you're used to LA's options, this is not the place for you."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,The sesame pancakes are amazing. Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a very long time. Love the spicy eggplant dish too.
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I first tried this place after some friends brought some leftovers. Of course, that isn't necessarily an ideal first experience but the beef tripe and ox tongue was fantastic, so I had to check this place out. My husband and I went after work on a Friday night, so it was busy. The server took a bit to actually come by and acknowledge us, but considering how busy it was, I try to be understanding. Right away I ordered the beef tripe and ox tongue as well as the spicy fried intestines. My husband ordered twice cooked spicy pork. The beef tripe and ox tongue is really interesting to me because first and foremost, it's the first time I've had tripe in a dish other than menudo. My husband was really put off by the fact that it  was not served hot, but still liked the flavor. I believe it was supposed to be served that way, at least from what I remember my friends telling me. The best part of the meal was the spicy fried intestines, hands down. I've had beef intestines before (tacos de tripa con cilantro y cebolla, yum), but these were pork so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were AMAZING. Served up sliced in a big pile with a lot of red chilies, they had a nice crisp on the outside and the inside was soft and juicy. The flavor was different from beef intestine, similar but a little bit like tripe. I don't really know how to describe it. Oh my god, it has to be the best thing I've had in a while. EAT THEM. NOW."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"One of the best Chinese food resto I've had in the States. Not so oily. It also offers a wide variety of the dishes including hot pot and spicy noodles. Decent price that a college student like me can come a few times a week. The decoration and ambience is nice too. Just wish that they had more space because the waiting time is always like 15 mins before we can have the food.

I'm surprised that Madison has such a good place."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"It's ""Asian fusion."" So yes, Fugu is suffering from an identity crisis. But I come for the Szechuan food and it is spicy, authentic, and delicious."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,This was my favorate place to go for Chinese food when I was in Madison. I went back five years after graduating and was a little disappointed. I ordered fish filet with tofu as well as sesame pancakes. The pancakes are as good as usual with the wonderful dipping source. The fish filet is not very fresh and taste a little bland.
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I'm a big fan of Chinese food and usually love everything I eat but this place is the exception. I went with a group of 12 people and the service was just not in sync. Not only did it take upwards to an hour to receive the food, but after the first meal was delivered, it took roughly 30 minutes for all the food to finally trickle to the table. Also, many appetizers were delivered long after entrees reached the table. 

As for the food, I ordered General Tso's Chicken. When I finally got my food, I found the balls of chicken to appear very large, however, I was quite disappointed when I ate it. The sauce was nice, it was sweet and had a touch of heat, but there was barely any chicken at all. Many times, there was no chicken in each ball and on the off chance that there was, it was just a tiny piece that was covered by a lot more batter. I essentially ate balls of batter with rice. 

I have eaten at many Chinese restaurants and although I recommend many to friends, this place is not one of them."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Had delivery last night, through grub hub.  The food arrived 1/2 hour late, and most of it was cold,  one of the four dishes we ordered (the three thread salad) was quite good.  The salted fish with salted mustard cabbage was okay, and the potstickers and sesame chicken were just bad."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Very tasty Asian food, but beware: the Chinese selections can be a little more authentic than more Americanized Chinese food.  It's certainly good, but it might not be exactly what you're used to.  Fairly good service, although ordering a whole fresh fish can take awhile to prepare.
Overall, way better than most fake, greasy ""Chinese"" places in the area."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,Authentic hot spicy Chinese food. Hot pot with dried chile is great. Good service.  Not your typical midwest Chinese food.  And to find this in Madison is more amazing.  Don't let the name throw you-- it was probably a Japanese restaurant in an earlier life--but now really Chinese.  Forget the Thai food that's also on the menu.
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I've never been at this restaurant so I cannot speak of the services provided but I've ordered for delivery a few times. I am not really one for experimenting with my food, so I played it safe. I ordered the braised veggies with shiitake mushroom. It was really good but I was think I would get more than 2 types of veggies. There was only baby Bok Choy and Shiitake mushrooms in my dish. The other dish I've ordered from here was the Salted Fish and Salted Mustard Cabbage. The fish was not good. It was bland and just did not taste the best. I only ate the Mustard Cabbage, which was delicious! The woman who took my order was very difficult to understand, I had to repeat my order several times and at the end, I had to confirm she got my order right. In which, she didn't but thank goodness we figured it out. I was ordering for my colleagues as well so I had to make sure she had the order right. I also had to call back because she gave me the wrong total. Her calculations were less than my calculations. She also told me 30 mins... which was more like 45 mins to an hour. My colleague ordered the Ox Tongue and Tripe on chili sauce and the Pork Intestine and Blood with Salty Cabbage. He wasn't a fan but he's also not one to complain about food. His food had a strange smell to it. If you've ever been to Asian Midway food on the corner of West Wash and Park St. that's what it smelled like. My other colleague ordered the Hot and Sour soup which was more hot than sour. Just an FYI if you guys are wondering about that. My other colleague played it safe as well. She ordered from the American Style section and said her food was delicious. Overall I think 3 stars is good for this place because the food was okay... the person answering the phone was difficult to understand and the delivery driver did what he could."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Frankly amazing Chinese food place find in Madison.I have been to China several times and this is pretty much authentic-tasting. The MaPo Tofu is amazing as well as the Sichuan Eggplant. If you are looking for some good, real-as-China Sichuan cooking, try this place! Perhaps a little pricey for take-out Chinese but it is so worth it!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"After all the talk I heard about bad Chinese food after coming to Madison, I was scared I was going to be SOL in terms of good food.  This place flips it on its head though.  We got Shredded Beef with Spicy Capsicum, pork shortribs, and some chicken hotpot.  All awesome, all spicy, and plenty of food for the four of us to go around.  Big enough space that you're not sitting on top of each other as well."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"The location of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being located on State St right on campus, it's definitely popular amongst students especially. They serve good Sze Chuan food, which means that the majority of the dishes will be cooked with spicy oil -- making them spicy. 

Their menu actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I order and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus, there are many reviews of Fugu out here with good recommendations on what to get, so I will talk more about the experience and service here. 

Went to lunch once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the lunch specials, which was a good deal coming to about $10. It has a set consisting of the main course, a soup and fruits to go with it. Most of their sets are served in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For dinner you just order off their menu.

Service wise, it's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your main course dishes might come before or together with your appetizers. On some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your order. But they are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. 

I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting area and ample parking. Between one or the other it all boils down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan dishes =)"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"The place is clean and and cozy. The staff are friendly and prompt. The food however is something to be desired. I had the crab Rangoon, honey walnut shrimp, and salt and pepper calamari. The crab Rangoon's breading seems too floury. The walnut shrimp had really cheap breading that almost seems corn dog like with a watery sauce that is supposed to be thick. The salt and pepper squid seems to be made with old oil, and the breading again seems too floury. Maybe I'm just used to Chicago china town food, but I was disappointed."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Okay, Fugu, I'm sorry for taking such a long time to write a review for you, while I may be referred as a regular, by yelp standard. First time I came here was to have my own welcoming party held by my professor, supervisor and my new friends. Apparently, all of them have been regulars here for years so they ordered: the chicken with chillies (Sechuan style), fried tofu, and spicy fried fish, right away without any hesitation. They are all spicy and served our Indonesian tastebuds just right: we are all spicy eater. My American professor would only take a small portion, as it was too spicy for her. But, she liked it.  Other times, hubby and I would try their lamb stew- again, spicy but delectable.
In all, our meal experiences at Fugu have been always warm and nice. 
It's good, tho we all know, there should be some MSG involved."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Conveniently located off of State Street, this is my favorite place to get authentic Chinese dishes like mapo tofu and garlic eggplants.  The prices are pretty good but the service is not the best. There are not many ""Chinese"" restaurants that serve tea duck, and when they do, you know that it's authentic."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,Definitely will go back...best wonton soup I've ever had. I got the Pai Thai which my waitress said was the same as Pad Thai however I was not a fan....it was very soupy and tasted a little like barbecue sauce honestly. I would not get that again but I tried my friends food and everything else was delicious! Seemed very authentic.
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"My friend received a recommendation from a colleague and we decided to try this place on a rainy afternoon. We were the only patrons for most of our meal which led to the waitress staring at us while we ate our food. I ordered pad thai and the waitress proceeded to question my choice and asked me more than once if I knew what it was. I was fairly insulted. My friend ordered king pao chicken and veggie potstickers. The food came quickly with the potstickers being first. The dumplings weren't steamed long enough and tasted raw. My lunch combo box with the pad thai included a spring roll that was 95 percent wrapper, a Japanese style salad that was very watery, orange slices that were the best part of the meal, and the main dish that was disgusting. The sauce on the noodles was incredibly sweet and there weren't any raw veggies to add texture. I couldn't eat most of it and I am not a picky eater.  I sure hope that people who go there have a much better experience than we did. I certainly will never return."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I went here for lunch with a couple of friends.  First of all, I must agree with Lan that the space is MUCH more appealing than you would guess from outside, and the restrooms deserve a special note of their own--single occupant and I'm not kidding, they are beautifully decorated.  The overall ambiance was very nice.

For the meal, we shared the steamed dumplings and my friends had Sichuan dishes with pork and tofu, respectively, while I had the Thai basil noodles with chicken.  Madison is sadly lacking in Chinese food, but I would say we finally have a decent place in town for at least some traditional specialties.  The Sichuan menu items are appropriately spicy and my friends liked them a lot.  My Thai basil noodles with chicken were DELICIOUS.  My only complaint is that the sauce was a bit overly greasy, which one friend said was also an issue with his spicy garlic sauce, but it wasn't overwhelmingly so and we agreed that in both dishes, the flavor was still very good.

The steamed dumplings were serviceable although not particularly rave-worthy.  (Then again, their competition at the meal was fierce.)  The entree portions were large; I tend to pig out, but many people probably could have made two meals of them.

We also had hot tea, which was promptly refilled by our waitress as we ate (admittedly it wasn't very busy at 11:45 or so when we were there).  I really like green tea, and the flavor of Fugu's house tea is lovely--a bit bolder than Takara's, I would say, which I also like, but not too strong to enjoy with a meal.

I gave them $$ for price because many of the entrees are in the $10-15 range, but they have a lunch menu with a range of $8-10 specials.  Not at all expensive for the quantity and quality of the food, in my opinion.  You should note, however, that there is a $15 minimum for credit cards."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Large dishes to share. Had the Homestyle Tofu and Pineapple Rice and another dish, can't remember the name, but it was spicy hot. All fantastic and vegan. It was so good that  we ate every bit and had no leftovers to take home. At the end of the meal we were served complimentary orange slices. Very nice and healthy end to the meal!!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"After being disappointed by the lackluster turnout for Go Topless day, we headed to Fugu for a late lunch.  We opted for some small dishes to fill the gaping void in me left from last night's festivities.

I ordered the Sichuan Pork Wontons in chili oil and Hot & Sour soup. The wontons arrived fully submerged in a sea of slightly spicy oil. While it seemed a little excessive, the wontons were delicious. The combination of both was just what I needed to fill me up.

Pro tip: skip out on the General Tso's and order from the Sichuan menu section. Chicken with Spicy and Sour Garlic Sauce is always on point."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I've never given a restaurant one star before. I would actually give it a quarter star but my son did like his tom yum soup broth.   Note, broth only. 

Sunday dinner, which is usually nice. Decided to try someplace new for Chinese food, as Madtown has so few good choices and we had not had any in a while.

We had four dishes and soup. All were pretty bad. 

Crab Rangoon - soft wontons through, very little filling, greasy on bottom. Served with so little sauce it was very noticeable. 

Five flavor beef - so full of gristle it was almost inedible. We picked around gristle to at least give it a chance. Flavor was just ok, green inion on plate was slimy. 

Cold chicken in chili sauce. Looked thrown together. Smothered in chili oil. Slimy mess, although the chicken seemed fresh as I was lucky and got a pin feather in mine. (Note - I don't want to know if it was NOT a pin feather.)

Pork with mustard noodles. Pork was very gamey in an unpleasant way. Bland otherwise. Gelatinous.  Noodles were slimy and way over cooked.  

My hot and sour soup was a greasy gelatinous mess. 

I hate to say it, but the common adjectives of most of the dishes were ""greasy"", ""slimy"", over-oily, or ""gelatinous"", nine if which were in a good way. 

Will avoid this place. Recommend you do too. 

Sad, as we really hoped for a good Chinese place. 

Oops - almost forgot - and the prices were high end for Chinese food, in an environment that was also greasy. Ah well."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I had the Kung Pao Chicken, Dan dan noodles and the spring rolls. I loved everything. 
The kung pao had big pieces of chicken, peppers, zuchini, onions and bamboo shoots with a thick rich brown spicy sauce. 
The spring rolls were delivered still-hot and were great. Fried to a crisp and the sweet and sour was excellent. 
I ordered the dan dan noodles because a Chinese friend of mine used to make them for us  at his dinner parties. This came as a huge portion (as was the entree). Thin square noodles covered with ground pork sauce. Hot and tangy in a way its hard to describe, but delicious. I will definitely have their food again and maybe explore some of the more adventurous menu items."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"We walked in and were greeted promptly by a hostess who took us to our table and gave us the menus to peruse. There are a lot of options including your typical American Chinese like Mongolian Beef or Orange Chicken as well as more exotic dishes like tripe, ox-tail, kidney, or intestine. When our waitress returned we ordered sake as well as 'Steamed White Meat Chicken with Chili Oil Sauce', 'Three Threads Salad', 'Sliced Lamb with Black Pepper', and 'Sauteed Baby Octopus with Pickled Pepper'. 

The chicken is an appetizer and appetizer priced, but you get a lot of chicken. It is served cold and has the skin on. It was our favorite dish. Both spicy and sweet, very tender, I absolutely loved this and will order it every time I go back. Like a lot of Chinese food it is practically floating in oil, but it was so good.

The Three Thread Salad is also an appetizer, also a good deal, and also delicious. It includes seaweed, bean noodle, and radish. Spicy and incredible. The flavors and textures were spot on and I would highly recommend this dish.

The lamb with black pepper was not what we were expecting. It was floating in a lot of oil. It contained blackened chopped spicy red peppers and there were dozens (hundreds?) of them. The flavor of the lamb and the sauce was incredible. I think it also had cilantro in it. However, the spicy blackened peppers were everywhere and although I love spicy food I could not eat them, so I had to pick out the beef which was a challenge with that many chopped peppers. Great flavor, but I would not order this dish again as it was just too much work.

The baby octopus dish was also delicious. Hot and spicy, with some vegetables I did not recognize. Some of the octopus were not as tender as I might like, but this was another very tasty dish.

We really enjoyed the flavors and textures of all the dishes we tried. The peppers made the lamb challenging to eat. Next time we go, we'll probably just do appetizers since they are nearly the same size as the entrees but only 1/2 the price.

I definitely recommend Fugu!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"This is a surprise in Madison where much of the food is bland or has been watered down for non-Asian tastebuds. One of the best authentic Asian restaurants in Madison. 

Started with ox tongue and tripe. A cold but spicy dish with two things I normally stay away from. The flavor and texturesof this dish are amazing. There is the soft tender tongue with loads of spicy flavor contrasted by the tripe which had a slight crunch when you bite into it"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Being in Madison for a couple of years, I'm pretty sure that if you want delicious and authentic Chinese food, this place is as good as it gets! They have many very authentic Chinese dishes you don't see very much elsewhere. I love the poached sliced beef in hot chilli sauce and the fish fillet dishes, they're delicious! Everything else I've tried here are all really great. The food can be really spicy, but you can always ask them to make it more mild. 

The servers are always really friendly and helpful. The restaurant gets pretty busy on the weekends, but I think it's worth the wait.

The food is a bit pricey, ranging from $10 to $15 per dish, but  the portions are big and it's not that bad if you share the dishes. One little down side is that they charge extra for rice. 

I highly recommend this place!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"If you avoid the Americanized stuff on the menu, this is the best Chinese place in Madison.

It is, for example, the only place you can get ma la Mapo Tofu without either asking for it to be extra ma la (Ichiban Sichuan) or going into the back and talking to the chef (every other Chinese place in Madison)."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night because Hong Kong Wok closes at 6pm.  Upon entering, it looks a lot more appealing than from the outside of the restaurant.

I went with a roommate and we shared three dishes: twice cooked pork ($13), ma po tofu ($11), and chicken with Sichuan sauce($9).  We both got orders of steamed rice, which cost an extra dollar per portion.

The twice cooked pork had some sort of bacon-type meat which was enjoyable with the green onion and while hot but less so as it became cooler.  The tofu was excellent a generous spicy sauce that probably included numbing pepper.  And the chicken was tender and the vegetables cooked just right.  The rice was fresh.

I definitely recommend Fugu if you're looking for spicy, well sauced Chinese/Szechuan dishes.  All the dishes were made to order and came out hot and delicious, though more expensive than your typically-priced Chinese dishes.  The service is also quite nice.  Next time I'll have to try some of their other ethnic cuisines.

A 15% gratuity was included, however, but I did not considering how good the food and polite the staff were."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"The menu is huge here and you'd likely have to go to Fugu several times before discovering your favorite items. My favorite dish here is the sliced fish with sweet and sour sauce. I've never had anything as similar and as tasty as this. The cumin beef and the twice cooked slice pork are also great choices here. Not sure why, but I also really like their spicy string beans.

In addition, ordering for takeout at Fugu is pretty convenient. I've never seen such a great set up for an Asian restaurant. You can order online and there is usually a discount for doing it this way. Just check out Fugu's website.

Your best and closest bet for good, authentic Chinese food in Madison would be Fugu. There is no close second."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Try popcorn chicken,deep fried intestine and their spicy fish fillet,da bomb!!!!!"
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Fugu used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant in Madison, not anymore.  

When it started business in 2009, Fugu was red hot. Its authentic Sichuan Chinese food has drawn so many people to its wonderful central location at State and Gilman. I at least have dined more than 10 times during 2009-2010 and have been constantly happy with its food. Back then, only Wah Kee Noodle was the other ""Authentic"" Chinese place on my radar. 

But you know, restaurants are precarious business. 

Since 2009, there has been a revolution in the Chinese food scene in Madison. I can count almost 10 new authentic Chinese restaurants joining the competition. Ichiban, Oriental House, Double 10, Dumpling Haus, Hong Kong Station, to name a few. Fugu was no longer unique, and I have settled with Ichiban for Sichuan food in the past couple of years. 

Earlier this week, I went back to Fugu and was totally disappointed. The dining space was under-staffed with only two people handling 50 people. Through the whole time of our dinner, servers never had time to clean up dirty dishes left by previous customers. When we left, the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes. A group of people came but was unable to be seated. So they left. It was ugly. Plus, there were flies accompanying our dinner. 

We had 5 dishes, but they slowly came during a 30-mins period. The fast and accurate service was gone. 

Food was good but inconsistent. Water-boiled beef and Tofu Fish were really good, but somehow our stirred fried pea shoot, the easiest and overpriced dish of all, was messed up. Too much salt. 

My experience sounds really bad, but I tend to think it was an anomaly rather than the standard. Therefore I gave it a 3 star instead of 2. But for while, I don't think I am going back. There are much better choices if you are not limited to the State st area."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,Absolutely love this place!  As others said stick to the real asian cuisine here and this place is awesome!  I personally love the Braised Beef hot pot.  It is not overly spicy and has really great flavor.  As a regular to this establishment I receive extremely good service.  The last 4 or 5 times I was here my food came out in what seemed like less than 5 minutes and was perfect while the restaurant was full!
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Fugu has excellent reviews, it is within walking distance of my crib, and it is packed to brimming with Chinese students.  They only serve chopsticks unless you ask for silverware.  They have huge tables for a large crowd with a round serving tray in the middle that spins so people can take a bit of everything and share their meals conveniently.  

I ordered the Cumin crusted lamb, and spicy green beans.  I really was not impressed.  The beans were super salty, and the lamb dried up with the overwhelmingly Cumin flavor.  

I will try again, this place has gotten far too many kudos, and is far too busy for it to be just me.  Next time I'll order something different and let you know how it goes."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"My husband and I went to Fugu for a late lunch.  We were promptly seated and given menus.  The menu has many dishes which sound amazing.  We got a couple apps and 2 entrées.  The sesame pancakes and dan dan noodles were so good.  My husband got the Singapore noodles which had a wonderful, spicy curry flavor.  I got the chicken with spicy and sour sauce.  The sauce was very tasty.  Overall, it was a great experience and would go again.  My fav Asian restaurant so far."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Hands down my favorite Asian restaurant in Madison:

Let me start by saying that I am not of Chinese decent, nor have I ever traveled to China,  but I have a feeling that this is what authentic Chinese cuisine tastes like. Every time I walk in there, the place is PACKED with people chatting in Mandarin over big family-style dishes. Furthermore, it is SO SO SO much better than any ""Americanized"" Chinese food I've ever had. 

My favorite part about this place is definitely the sichuan pepper dishes. They are an extremely difficult ingredient to get your hands on if you don't have access to an Asian foods market, but they're absolutely delicious (and spicy to boot)! Favorites of mine include sichuan cucumber salad and sichuan eggplant, but the pickled pepper dishes look fabulous as well! Everything on the ""regular"" (not ""American-Style"") menu here that is advertised as ""spicy"" is ACTUALLY spicy, which I love! The food is bursting with flavor and these dishes make it easy to understand why Chinese fare is typically served with WHITE (not fried) rice: the rice soaks up all of the delicious juices and becomes one of the most flavorful components of the meal.

Speaking of rice, the rice here is PHENOMENAL and is cooked to perfection (both white and fried). For all of you naysayers out there who think that rice can't be done ""wrong,"" you're mistaken. Fried rice lovers, take one bite of the fried rice at FUGU and you will understand that every other Chinese place you've ever been to has cooked their rice to a lower standard. Here, it is soft, fluffy, flavorful, and just slightly sticky. YUM. It's the best fried rice I've ever had. 

Like most Asian restaurants, the selection is huge and there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options (vegan PRO TIP: try the garlic eggplant--out of this world! Just make sure to spread the spicy oils over your rice). I have yet to venture out and try some of the REALLY authentic dishes (tripe, ox tongue, etc), but some of the borderline-authentic stuff has come up short for me (in particular, the pork dumplings with chili oil--I couldn't stomach them). I've also gone in the opposite direction: the ""American Style"" menu is expansive, but FUGU does NOT do American Chinese food well (shame on them for being TOO authentic--lol). There is a consistent lack of spice and flavor with every dish I've tried on that menu (although the quality of products is still supreme). I think it best to stick with the ""middle ground"" of the menu here. 

Overall, give FUGU a shot, and you won't be disappointed (at least not for carry out; I've never dined in)."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I think I may have just found the one.

It was a late Saturday afternoon, and we were preparing for the copious amount of alcohol we were about to consume that night.

Knowing that the best way to not get completely trashed was food in our bellies, my friends and I set out on a quest to find some alcohol buffer. 

After going through countless takeout menus online, we finally settled on Fugu. Having never heard about this place before, our expectations were pretty low.

First of all, the Chinese food in Madison is crap, period (Sorry Madisonians(?), just being honest).

Second, this place is located right off of State Street, which is basically drunk haven for college kids.

Third, this place is called Fugu.... and they sell Chinese food. Dictionary.com defines fugu as ""a puffer fish that is eaten as a Japanese delicacy, after some highly poisonous parts have been removed by an authorized chef."" 

So ok, this place is named after a highly poisonous Japanese delicacy, but serves Chinese food... 

Alright then, moving on...

As soon as we opened up the menu, however, I knew we were in for a special treat. My non-Asian roommate couldn't read the menu at all, which is immediately a good sign when it comes to Chinese food.

As I browsed through the list of food, I saw quite a few authentic Chinese dishes that I was so used to back in Boston. 

We ordered the sesame pancakes, Singapore beef noodle, eggplant in garlic sauce and deep fried chicken with dry chili pepper. 

It took roughly ~30 minutes of wait time before the food was delivered right to our doorsteps. The fact that this place delivers AUTHENTIC Chinese food alone should merit 5-stars.

While waiting for our friend to bring up the food, the aromatic scent of delicious Szechuan cuisine wafted through our house, and made our mouths water. The moment the food was set on the table, we went into it like ravenous savages, and devoured the food within minutes.

It was definitely not a pretty sight, but oh was it ever so delicious... I can still taste the soft eggplants with its sweet, garlic sauce. The numbingly spicy chicken with its perfect crusty skin. The thin, dry noodles intervened with tender pieces of beef and vegetables.

Everything about the meal was delicious. I thought I had fallen in love before, but it wasn't until now, that I have realized my naivety. 

Fugu, you're now my number 1 love in Madison."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Somehow I have lived a block and a half away from Fugu for three years and never tried it.  Something about the exterior (one prominent sign advising ""No Public Restrooms"" and two more warning of hidden cameras in operation) just turned me off.  That all changed yesterday when my wife and I finally gave it a try.  Oh my God-- absolutely delicious!  I'll get the bad out of the way first-- the restaurant was fairly crowded for 4:00 in the afternoon and only one waiter was working-- there were a lot of tables that hadn't been cleared and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  One of our water glasses was also less than clean.  But I don't even care because the food was A-MA-ZING.  I've been craving a decent hot and sour soup ever since I moved to Madison and they delivered.  The chicken with garlic sauce was perfect.  The waiter (who was extremely nice) warned me about how spicy the fried beef in chili sauce would be and he was right.  It was also delicious.   We've eaten there two days in a row now and will definitely be back.

Edit: I'm downgrading this to four stars.  I've been back a number of times (mostly for takeout) and I'll definitely be going back, but it hasn't worked out to be a five-star performance.  

Two main problems: 1) Consistency: Some things are really, really good and a great value.  Some things are less good (mongolian beef was tough, hunan beef didn't have much beef).  Some things that are often good are sometimes not good (hot and sour soup).  2) Service: Everyone is very nice, but the place just doesn't run well.  They need someone coordinating everything, because the service is slow and out of joint."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Perhaps one mark of authenticity at Fugu is the fact that a lot of the menu will scare and confuse you. Blood intestine? Bean curd? I have yet to be adventurous enough to try one of these menu items. I instead try to settle on something that resembles your typical Chinese take-out, without going for anything too boring.

I always start a meal here with the spring rolls. They're cooked to a perfect texture, with a thin, crispy outer shell that crunches like a potato chip, and a soft vegetable-filled mush inside. They taste a little bland, but that's easily offset by the great sweet-and-sour sauce served on the side with the spring rolls.

I highly recommend the beef with ginger and scallions as an entree. Whereas most Asian places will overload a dish with vegetables in order to save money on the meat, Fugu has done the exact opposite. I almost missed the vegetables, but the meat is too good for me to care. It's cooked so perfectly, to the point where it practically melts in your mouth. You'll find meat like this in all their beef dishes as well.

On a different occasion, though, I decided to get the fried shredded beef in hot chili sauce, and wasn't as impressed. Once again, the beef was a perfectly-cooked blend of fat and meat that made it taste and feel like beef and butter had a baby. It was cut into thick strips which could hardly be called ""shredded,"" but that was probably for the best. The sauce and spices surrounding the beef, on the other hand, weren't too good. I was warned that the dish was going to be very spicy, but I certainly wasn't expecting to be served a dish that was almost half comprised of chili peppers and ginger. Most of the dish wasn't even edible!

If you do decide to get something simple like the chicken lo mein, you'll be pleased with it. I didn't get anything that goes above and beyond all expectations, but honestly, I don't even know how you could do so with something like chicken lo mein. The lo mein was soft and buttery, with a simple and traditional blend of add-ins. The chicken was good, but nothing special. All in all, it's certainly better than take-out.

The prices here are slightly higher than normal, but you do get a noticeable step up in quality that justifies it. Furthermore, the portions are huge. Unless you plan on taking home leftovers, you should probably just buy one entree per two people.

The service is consistently a problem.  It is somewhat slow, even when the restaurant is empty. Requests for things like condiments are often ignored or unanswered for long periods of time. This is due in part to the fact that most of Fugu's staff has very poor English. It's very irritating that I can't have menu items explained to me because myself and the waiter can't even understand one another. You can put whoever you want in your kitchen, but it's unacceptable to put out a wait staff that can't communicate with the customers."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"This place was really, really not great. The single upside was the decor. Having passed by this place often on the way to work, I decided to give it a try. Much to my convenience, this place looked like it would be perfect but it's often misplaced expectations that make an experience that much more objectively worse.

Having looked at their menu, the pricing was higher than other Chinese establishments in the area. I settled on their fried dumplings and poached fish dish. After having to wait about 5 minutes for service and water being only the third patron in the restaurant, I was already getting a bit irritated. When the servers finally came to and sluggishly took my order, I couldn't help but feel they absolutely hated their job. And perhaps this is the management's fault -- the servers could simply be overworked and under-tipped but it in any case, it seriously detracts from the dining experience. But at the time, I thought I was just over-thinking it. I made my order known and sipped on my water for the time being.

After having waited about half an hour (again, at the time there were 3 patrons in the restaurant), my food finally arrived. The servers simply came by and dropped it off without any intent of wanting to make any sort of personal connection or try to give off the image that their restaurant was one worth coming to again if simply for warmth and hospitality. No eye contact, no simple gestures of wishfulness for a well-delivered meal -- just brood sulkiness. But I was probably over-thinking it, I thought. The food looked delicious, so I was going to dispense with all that seeming nonsense of lackluster service and care and basque in the delight of authentic Chinese food that would remind me of the indelible nostalgia of growing up in a Chinese community and experiencing the vast array of aromas and flavors that the richness of Chinese cuisine can provide.

And goddammit, was I ever more wrong.What I had thought was over-thinking had turned itself on its head and I realized that this place was just built to be an awful experience. The fried dumplings were soggy and tasted as though they had only recently been thawed from an Asian grocer freezer bag. The poached fish simply had no flavor. There's nothing to describe because there quite literally was nothing to describe. Even the broth soup it came in was flavorless. It was the worst decision I'd made that day. 

When the check came, it came quick. The waitress, without any sign of warmth or willingness to communicate the entire experience, bent over and said ""remember to tip 15% or more."" If I haven't expressed it appropriately, the amount of rudeness displayed with this establishment's waitstaff is deplorable.

But if you continue to enjoy this place, continue to do so. From someone who's had a wide variety of experiences on the Chinese side of dining, I'll be avoiding it at all costs from this point on."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"I really just didn't like it that much. The Pad Thai was like Sweet and Sour instead of Peanut Sauce, and the curry was waaay salty. On the bright side, the Mouchi was really good, and you should definitely get it. This isn't the best town for Asian food, but you can do better. I'd recommend Vientiane (or something similar to that). The service was quick (almost too quick) and the staff very friendly."
Fugu,94. sliced fish and tofu with spicy sauce,"Food here is excellent.  Like a previous reviewer noted, where there is a red pepper on the menu, the dish is spicy.  Not too spicy to enjoy, mind you, but you'll want lots of water.  The only real knock against this place is the service.  Everyone is nice enough but very slow and hard to get wait staff's attention for something.  Relatedly, it is very crowded on weekend nights.  But really worth it for the delicious cuisine."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"Went for the weekend lunch buffet.  Very underwhelmed.  Where was the tikka masala?  Some dishes on the buffet were empty and not refilled for the duration of our time there.  Many vegetarian dishes but at 13 bucks a plate, show me some meat dishes.  Only two creamy rice dishes for dessert. They were both tasteless and quite icky.  The young man who seated us was terribly pleasant and made sure our plates were cleared in a timely manner.  Nice, minimalist decor. Up the quality and value and favors and it could be a hit."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"The food at Om is excellent, with a large menu including unfamiliar cuisine from Kerala and other South Indian regions. The ""fusion"" may refer to their Indo-Chinese specialties, however, these are a regular part of Indian food today--there are a few Italian pasta dishes on the menu, although why anyone would order Italian food in a basically Indian restaurant (and with so many actual Italian restaurants in Madison) is beyond me. We had a variety of appetizers and entrees, including aloo bonda, an unusual and tasty stuffed pepper, lamb biryani, eggplant curry, and goat curry, all of which were enjoyed. The problem was with the service, which was disorganized at first (it took several tries to get an actual cup of hot water for tea), and almost non-existent when two of us ordered desserts--it must have taken a half hour for them to arrive, and we had to ask more than once. They were understaffed that night, one of the servers said they had a last minute staff cancellation--but still, it was a bit much--they whole meal took about 2 hours--too long. In their favor, the desserts (a gulab jamun and a gajar halwa (carrot pudding) were superb, and the management took them off the bill due to the wait we endured. Hope this was just an off night. The ambience is meh--a large echoing space, could use a few tapestries or rugs on the wall, lights at the non-booth tables, and a touch of decoration. But I'll be back for the pukka food."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,Wow! I've been driving past this place for the last couple of months and had been meaning to stop by. I went in with the intention of checking out the menu and ended up getting take-out. I wanted to try something new since I've gotten stuck in my Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala world. One of the staff suggested the Methi. I ordered it with the lamb and got a chai tea while I waited. They ended up both being done at the same time and I took the tea to go. When I got home the basmati rice was fluffy and light and oh my goodness was the Methi delicious. So impressed. It's easily my favorite Indian food in Madison. I can't wait to go back!
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"The service is really bad here, first we waited more than 30mins to get our food, and in the meantime, no one came to apologize. And we ordered five dishes and three names, and they only came with three bowls of rice and no naan, and we had to ask for the naan and rice, and they only brought one piece of naan after like 10mins, we almost finished everything at that time and didn't need the extra naan already. Really disappointed..."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"I was very impressed with the new design of the space.  There is the buffet as you enter the space, then in the dining room there are booths, tables, a child's play area, and comfy chairs by a fireplace.  It is very beautiful.  The serving wear is all metal and it lends to an air of sophistication.

We had missed the buffet ( so that is just another reason to come back).  The menu is deep and inviting.  I ordered the goat curry which was one of the best I have had in the Madison area.  My friends had veggie curries which they both really enjoyed.  The naan was very good on the first day and the next day too.  I really look forward to coming back and trying more.

Our first server was not very knowledgeable about the menu but he called over another man who could answer my friend's questions.  This man took over for all our service and he was very good."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"We continue to love this place. Their tika masala sauce, made super spicy, is one of my favorite things right now. I could have that over a large order of rice and be so happy."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,It has the worst hyderabadi dum biryani in Midwest . Don't insult the city's name by giving tomato rice instead of biryani and charging extra price .they charged me 16$ for veg biryani with an egg and gave me tomato rice . I would never recommend this one to any of my Hyderabadi Indian friends.
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"I'm so glad we heard about OM Indian Fusion Cuisine in time to get there for the grand opening! The restaurant has breathed new life into the building and to that corner of East Washington and Stoughton - so needed and so refreshing!! The space itself is beautiful, upscale and inviting, with soft colors I wouldn't have expected from an Indian restaurant, but was pleasantly surprised to find. And I can't say enough good things about the cozy fireplace and cool logo! I really loved the open kitchen concept the owners chose to put into the space - the chefs work their spices, sauces, and doughs entirely from scratch. Yep, it takes a bit longer to prepare that way, but I really enjoyed getting to watch the care that went into my meal, and everything tasted, oh, so good! The goat curry and saag paneer were divine. The staff is a culturally diverse group, and I could tell that our waitress was still learning about Indian cuisine, but seemed passionate about it. Kudos to the owners for making the ""fusion"" part of their place about so much more than the menu. We will be back, and often!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"This place is wonderful! 
I haven't eaten much Indian food since I've been in Madison... the great reviews and close proximity to my hood brought me here. 
We dined in on a Friday night, we arrived at 6pm and were surprised at how empty the place was, but we weren't concerned. We were super hungry so we knew our food would likely arrive quickly based on this fact, and that is not a bad thing when your approaching hangry! 
Our server was friendly and offered to answer any questions. The menu is quite large and offers many Indian fusion options so I think this would be a good  choice for those who are not sure about trying Indian food.
I had the garlic nan and Chicken Tikka Masala with basmati rice. They keep your water glass full at all times which I appreciate when I'm eating something with a little heat. My husband tried the Indian fried rice and the portion was bonkers, he brought 1/2 of it home.
The prices are reasonable, the food is yum and they have a pretty substantial bar, the remodel makes this place unrecognizable from it's former sketchy Chinese restaurant. It's my recommendation that you should check his place out ASAP. But really... go now!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"Had the lunch buffet. It was an incredible steal for $11. I will not go into making an attempt to pronounce or spell out the ethnic names of the dishes. Lets just say that the buffet offered fresh fruit, different curries (goat curry was outstanding), veggetables with aromatic spices, and some of the most tastiest sauces that I could literally drink by the gallon. 

I will update this review after I revisit for the dinner menu. We needed fresh vibrant  Indian cuisine in the area. OM, without hesitation, filled the void. 

The interior is modern contempory with spotless stainless steel open kitchen. A very open and airy dining room provides charm and playfulness to the busy environment."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry fried rice,"This restaurant just opened and we thought we would give it a try.  We both love Indian food, so we wanted to go.  I guess the first clue for us was sitting at the open kitchen and seeing that all of the cooks were Indian.  Back in the day, the place was a nasty buffet restaurant.  Last night, we had a food love affair there!  

The appetizer was perfect.  The mint sauce was to die for.  We both agreed we would take a bath in it.

She got the Tandoori chicken and I got the lamb with rice.  We shared and we both agreed that everything on our plate was spectacular!

The husband/wife owners were both there and greeted us as we ate and asked how we liked our meal.  

They even have a room for the kids with toys and games.

This restaurant is worth your time.  AWESOME!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"Wanted to try this place out since it's fairly new and we like Indian. My partner was especially craving masala dosa. They had the standard Indian fare along with weird Asian fusion options that we stayed away from. Partner got the masala dosa and I got shathi paneer, a creamy tomato sauce and Indian cheese. 

The dosa was huge, about 18"" in diameter, but the filling could have fit on a saucer. The dosa itself was barely crunchy and without the subtle sour flavor on the inside. The paneer was creamy but fairly flavorless. I couldn't detect any of the promised spices. I asked for mild, but I'm used to mild still being a little spicy. At Om mild means absolutely no spice at all.

If you are looking for authentic Indian flavors, keep going up E Washington and check out Maharana on Thierer Rd. Om is pleasant and comfortable, but very plain. A good choice for sensitive palates and young kids, not for great lovers of Indian food."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"Really nice new Indian restaurant on the east side! Long cocktail list and 2 nice areas with bar seating. Also surprisingly kid friendly- they have a nice kids menu and also a play area for kids next to the seating area- basic, with a few toys but really nice touch. If you don't like kids the place is big enough that you probably won't be seated next to any. The food was good-spice level was definitely suited to midwestern audience so if you order medium it's going to be pretty mild. I didn't try the dosas or tandoori options so definitely want to come back for that but the lentil and chicken dishes I had were super savory. Menu also has pasta for those who aren't into Indian food but I didn't have that so can't rate it. Friendly service and nice, clean decor. Will definitely come here again and this time I'll sit at the bar by the kitchen so I can watch them making everything!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"We had an excellent time here! A lot of it was due to how incredibly kid friendly the place was, which you just don't see a lot with Indian food restaurants. Our 2 1/2 year old loved the little play area and the host/waiters/food staff were all super friendly to him and showed him how the food was made. 

We got the butter chicken and paneer tikka masala, both which were excellent, along with an order of garlic naan. There were a couple of little chicken bones in the butter chicken, but nothing to ruin the sauce. The naan was tasty.  We went on a Sunday night and there weren't a lot of people in there, hopefully just because it was Sunday and they are still new. I would definitely go back."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"Our group had the buffet lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The buffet has good options for vegetarians. The staff is friendly and helpful. I would say it's a tie between this place and Taste of India for best Indian food in Madison. OM had several dishes that I hadn't tasted before, so that was very welcome. The interior design is gorgeous. There is a chalk board area to distract the kids if you bring them along."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"Had dinner here Sunday night while visiting in Madison. Very good food but the atmosphere was more like a family restaurant than a place you go for a nice meal. Lots of noisy kids. I would return but with different expectations.

In response to the owner's response below, I doubt there's much you can do. There were three tables of loud and misbehaved children. Nothing you can do really. We were there near closing and I thought the kids were out a bit late and likely tired and cranky. Maybe have a quieter area for couples without children? We will return because the food was delicious but I'll come in expecting a family restaurant rather than a quiet place where we can talk."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"I loved my experience at this restaurant. Vegan and vegetarian friendly!! I am kind of a rookie when it comes to Indian food but I really loved everything they had to offer. I also took my friend there(who has never had Indian food before), and she was impressed by how great everything was.

We were very pleased with the service(except for this lady but oh well you can't please everyone). One of the servers brought us an appetizer and he talked to us about it and what it was made out of, and just overall the restaurant. He was very nice! Also when it was time to give and take our check, the service was very fast.

I think my favorite part though, as a vegetarian who is looking to become vegan, was that every dish was labeled. Most of their options were actually vegetarian, and gluten free, and of course they had some chicken and other meat too. I was soooo excited when I saw all the vegan dishes. It's like I was in heaven. 

Overall, I had a wonderful lunch and will definitely return!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"Was very impressed with the food. We ordered Butter Chicken and Saag Paneer. The Saag was puréed which was new to me. The Butter Chicken was delightful. Very good, high quality meat too. The naan we ordered had onion and perhaps cilantro. 

Definitely give this place a shot! Best Indian I've had recently in Madison."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,Wow! I've been driving past this place for the last couple of months and had been meaning to stop by. I went in with the intention of checking out the menu and ended up getting take-out. I wanted to try something new since I've gotten stuck in my Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala world. One of the staff suggested the Methi. I ordered it with the lamb and got a chai tea while I waited. They ended up both being done at the same time and I took the tea to go. When I got home the basmati rice was fluffy and light and oh my goodness was the Methi delicious. So impressed. It's easily my favorite Indian food in Madison. I can't wait to go back!
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"We decided to check out Om Indian Fusion Cuisine last minute and it turned out to be a good decision. The variety of dishes they have are amazing - they have different dishes from all parts of India which great especially if everyone wants to try something different. We ordered a few different dishes: Chicken tikka, Kashmiri Palao, and onion rava dosa. The chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly. The Kashmiri Palao was something we had never had. It was more on the sweet side which I usually don't like for a main dish but still very tasty. The rava dosa was really delicious and very aromatic from the minute the dish was on our table. 
We also tried some of the drinks. We tried the sweet, salty, and mango lassi. The salty lassi was a bit too salty for my taste. The sweet lassi according to my mom tasted like it was homemade. The best was the mango lassi. Our server did tell us the Lassis are made from scratch. 
The service was great, and overall it was a great experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Indian food. Definitely will be back again!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"The service is really bad here, first we waited more than 30mins to get our food, and in the meantime, no one came to apologize. And we ordered five dishes and three names, and they only came with three bowls of rice and no naan, and we had to ask for the naan and rice, and they only brought one piece of naan after like 10mins, we almost finished everything at that time and didn't need the extra naan already. Really disappointed..."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"Disappointing dinner experience!! Took 30 minutes to take the order..took 1 hr to get the order which was wrong..ordered chicken , got a curry with corn and carrot bits, lots of confusion regarding the menu..no idea about the food items to the servers, understand that it's a new place, but could have been far better..finally 15 bucks for a biryani serving which is very very less..too expensive..very bad experience.."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"Gorgeous modern decor and very kid-friendly. They even have a 6'x6' area partitioned off with toys etc. menu has all the classic Indian dishes and kids menu options are great. I recommend Khorma with lamb. Service from the owner was very friendly and attentive. Cocktails--yum.

Fancy enough to be a date night restaurant, but totally fine if you want to go casual as well.

Neighboring businesses are pretty sketch, but parking is well lit and area immediately around the building is safe.

Tip--ask the owner to make you an Old Fashioned. He has it down to a science."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"My husband and I have been looking for top tier Indian in Madison for a long time. We were so happy when we found om! Amazing food we had the somosas, their version of chicken 65, and two curries. All fantastic and left overs for days. Later that week I was surprised to see my credit card had been over charged. I was super nervous because I didn't have my reciept but when we called, the owner was incredibly gracious and helpful and had the issue handled so quickly. We were so happy out amazing experience wasn't sullied by this mistake."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"This restaurant just opened and we thought we would give it a try.  We both love Indian food, so we wanted to go.  I guess the first clue for us was sitting at the open kitchen and seeing that all of the cooks were Indian.  Back in the day, the place was a nasty buffet restaurant.  Last night, we had a food love affair there!  

The appetizer was perfect.  The mint sauce was to die for.  We both agreed we would take a bath in it.

She got the Tandoori chicken and I got the lamb with rice.  We shared and we both agreed that everything on our plate was spectacular!

The husband/wife owners were both there and greeted us as we ate and asked how we liked our meal.  

They even have a room for the kids with toys and games.

This restaurant is worth your time.  AWESOME!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,kids 3 piece chicken strips,"The food was great! Even though the restaurant says it's fusion, the food is really authentic, and has a South Indian flavor. We had the thali, Hyderabad biryani and chicken chettinad, all of which were great. The rasam tasted like home (South India)! Get the gulab jamun for dessert!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry,"The food at Om is excellent, with a large menu including unfamiliar cuisine from Kerala and other South Indian regions. The ""fusion"" may refer to their Indo-Chinese specialties, however, these are a regular part of Indian food today--there are a few Italian pasta dishes on the menu, although why anyone would order Italian food in a basically Indian restaurant (and with so many actual Italian restaurants in Madison) is beyond me. We had a variety of appetizers and entrees, including aloo bonda, an unusual and tasty stuffed pepper, lamb biryani, eggplant curry, and goat curry, all of which were enjoyed. The problem was with the service, which was disorganized at first (it took several tries to get an actual cup of hot water for tea), and almost non-existent when two of us ordered desserts--it must have taken a half hour for them to arrive, and we had to ask more than once. They were understaffed that night, one of the servers said they had a last minute staff cancellation--but still, it was a bit much--they whole meal took about 2 hours--too long. In their favor, the desserts (a gulab jamun and a gajar halwa (carrot pudding) were superb, and the management took them off the bill due to the wait we endured. Hope this was just an off night. The ambience is meh--a large echoing space, could use a few tapestries or rugs on the wall, lights at the non-booth tables, and a touch of decoration. But I'll be back for the pukka food."

OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry,"I was very impressed with the new design of the space.  There is the buffet as you enter the space, then in the dining room there are booths, tables, a child's play area, and comfy chairs by a fireplace.  It is very beautiful.  The serving wear is all metal and it lends to an air of sophistication.

We had missed the buffet ( so that is just another reason to come back).  The menu is deep and inviting.  I ordered the goat curry which was one of the best I have had in the Madison area.  My friends had veggie curries which they both really enjoyed.  The naan was very good on the first day and the next day too.  I really look forward to coming back and trying more.

Our first server was not very knowledgeable about the menu but he called over another man who could answer my friend's questions.  This man took over for all our service and he was very good."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry,"I'm so glad we heard about OM Indian Fusion Cuisine in time to get there for the grand opening! The restaurant has breathed new life into the building and to that corner of East Washington and Stoughton - so needed and so refreshing!! The space itself is beautiful, upscale and inviting, with soft colors I wouldn't have expected from an Indian restaurant, but was pleasantly surprised to find. And I can't say enough good things about the cozy fireplace and cool logo! I really loved the open kitchen concept the owners chose to put into the space - the chefs work their spices, sauces, and doughs entirely from scratch. Yep, it takes a bit longer to prepare that way, but I really enjoyed getting to watch the care that went into my meal, and everything tasted, oh, so good! The goat curry and saag paneer were divine. The staff is a culturally diverse group, and I could tell that our waitress was still learning about Indian cuisine, but seemed passionate about it. Kudos to the owners for making the ""fusion"" part of their place about so much more than the menu. We will be back, and often!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,curry,"Had the lunch buffet. It was an incredible steal for $11. I will not go into making an attempt to pronounce or spell out the ethnic names of the dishes. Lets just say that the buffet offered fresh fruit, different curries (goat curry was outstanding), veggetables with aromatic spices, and some of the most tastiest sauces that I could literally drink by the gallon. 

I will update this review after I revisit for the dinner menu. We needed fresh vibrant  Indian cuisine in the area. OM, without hesitation, filled the void. 

The interior is modern contempory with spotless stainless steel open kitchen. A very open and airy dining room provides charm and playfulness to the busy environment."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"Go for the hot pot.  Get the ""fatty"" pork and the ""fatty"" beef! 

Overall the restaurant is marginally nasty from a cleanliness perspective... we've sent back greens because they had dirt on them, sent back glasses because they had lipstick on them... but the hot pot is consistently great.  Note that all the hot pots come with a bunch of greens and other sides... so if you go nuts and get a bunch of extras, realize that you've already got a lot of extras coming (last time we went I tried to get an idea from the waitress what all came on the side, but the language barrier left me clueless after her response-- but otherwise service was friendly and responsive).

Also (and this is not clear) - you can get regular broth, spicy broth, or half- and half where where the pot itself has a divider down the middle....

They have a huge non hot pot menu but I've never tried anything from it."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"Disappointed. I loved their bentobox till one day. I ordered for pickup. They mixed the sweet cake into the spicy savory side. 
Seriously? You guys cannot even find a single zip bag to separate my cake? 
I'm not going there any more."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"Not a bad experience. This is more of a Chinese version of the traditional Japanese shabu shabu, and it's Korean cousin. We took the kids who ate well on the seafood fried rice, mostly shrimp with a few bits of squid and octopus. My wife and I shared the two meat combination, and had it spicy. Good level of spice, they didn't hold back because I am Western and assume I couldn't handle the heat. Lots of room for groups of four and some larger groups. Very extensive Chinese menu and noticed most of the customers were Chinese students which was a good sign. Prices are good and the portions are too. We will be back."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"Swung by for temporary farewell dinner with a friend before he headed back to China.

The place was empty when we came (5ish pm) which was nice as we got the pick of the place. 
We ordered a combination plate of lamb and beef hotpot (both spicy and non spicy) with the veggies that come with it (lotus root, enoki mushrooms, lettuce, noodle, etc.) and then ordered some fish balls and extra mushrooms and other veggies on the side. In total 1 main combo plate and 3-4 small sides. Enough to feed 3 people. Next time I would have ordered a bit more meat!

The meal was fun (my first hotpot experience). There was just 2-3 sauces that you mix together for dipping your cooked food in. I was hoping for more options given what I have heard of at other hotpot locations but these sauces were traditional so I was happy enough with that.

So, a fun experience and good enough service.

Thanks Soga."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"Good food aside, their service is mediocre on a very nice day, and as for now, excruciatingly slow. I have a grubhub order put down for 11:10, and the food still hasn't arrived. It is 13:12 right now. The least they could have done is give us a courtesy call to explain why the food isn't arriving for over 40 minutes past the estimated delivery time (they sent me a text saying 12:20), and we had to call twice just to make sure that they hadn't forgotten about us.

If anyone is in the mood for Chinese food that's both good AND offers good service, try Ichiban. At least the lady there knows how to treat their customers. As for me, Soga's lost themselves a regular customer.

To be fair, they serve delicious Chinese food, and anyone visiting their location is in for a treat. What a shame, really."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"This was my first time at this restaurant and having shabu shabu. I went w 2 friends. We got the lamb and pork combo and added waygu beef. We got half the pot spicy, half regular, and we added the thick type noodles. There was plenty of food for all 3 of us. We paid $12 something before tip, very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The vegetable selection that came with it was good, also included some fish and pork balls. I had mostly spicy, and added some chili paste. When I had the noodles at the end I had to add a little regular to cool it off, but it was an enjoyable spicy flavor. The taste was phenomenal, I will definitely be back."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"If you don't pay attention, you just might miss it!  Soga is located on the second floor of the building, and they have a pretty small doorway on State Street, so look out.

Soga is definitely one of the places that has more authentic Chinese food, especially if you order off the Chinese menu.  I've been here numerous times, and it seems like the food is on a bit of a decline.  I think they switched owners recently, and now the food is SUPER salty.  I normally order the garlic eggplant, and that's usually pretty good, despite the change in management.

I've also come here for hot pot, which is pretty fun.  I was with a group of friends and we just ordered their ""hot pot platters"" with meat and veggies and two soup bases (spicy and not spicy).  It's a nice environment for hanging out and having hot pot, and a pretty good deal."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"Great place for large group gatherings. This place is GIGANTIC. you can also make reservations ahead of time! 

Sadly, the service is rather lacking and the quality of hotpot is only so-so. If you speak mandarin, they tend to be more responsive. Still, for hotpot where the customers cook their own food, the service is UNBELIEVABLY slow. had to wait maybe 20 minutes for anyone to come, had to grab my own menus, and then another 30 mins for uncooked ingredients.. The servers look like young Asian undergraduates who are not very experienced, so they don't really know who is serving which table, forget your order, combine your meat orders so you can't tell how many portions there are... yah, I'm obviously not a very happy camper. Also, usually it should be about $12 per person but somehow my bill went up to $21... and I don't even know if I got all my orders.. But since it was Chinese New Year, I didn't make a fuss.

Overall, the ingredients were so-so, but at least you don't get tummy aches after. And you get a variety of spicy chilli and peanut sauce to dip your hotpot cooked food in. Also, I like the udon noodles better than glass noodles, much more substantial meal. And, one of the HUGE fishballs are teochew fishballs, which come stuffed with minced meat (my favorite!!). Oh, before I forget, they actually had hand made steamed pork dumplings, VERY GOOD. although they look like plain soggy things, they were very well marinated and didn't even need vinegar or soy sauce to pair with!

They also have stir fry, which looked pretty good cos you can constantly see real fire in the kitchen POOFING away. so I might give that a try, sometime, maybe.

If you wanna visit, don't come hungry, and be patient!"
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"Shabu takes it to the next level by serving up its many Chinese, Japanese and Korean delicacies in a rustic and authentic, East meets West spacious interior, - where the food is the main attraction.

The food came within a very short time and was beautifully presented, fresh and spicy, and absolutely filling."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"I went for hot pot here on a Friday night around 9:30 pm. Overall it was good, and I definitely want to go back. The place was a bit empty, but it did seem like we missed the dinner crowd.

We got the spicy broth and it was perfect. The chicken was a bit dry, but that's probably because we failed and over cooked it. They also had these pork dumpling things that were amazing. Overall the place seemed pretty authentic, and the food was good. I am giving it four stars though because the ambiance just doesn't feel great when you are the only one eating in a restaurant for about half your meal, even if it's a bit late."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"No idea what the shabu shabu is like here, come for the Chinese though.  In particular order the big plate chicken, it's a chicken/noodle/potato dish that is exquisite.  Also a lamb spicy soup and a beef dish also in a spicy sauce.  I can't recall the names, but you want to order from the special handwritten menu.  Trust me, this is the best Chinese in Madison."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"In my few visits to Soga, I've had tasty experiences. A tad pricey experiences, but tasty ones.

My first meal here was with a big group and we settled on hot pot. We'd hosted our own little hot pot party a month or so prior, so I will say that the bar had been set high. A pot of boiling broth arrives to your table along with a bounty of raw veggies and thinly shaved raw meats. Chicken and pork were the selections we made for the night. The concept is fondue-esque, yet you're cooking your meat in broth rather than oil. We found the broth to be dull in flavor and the meat portions to be skimpy. The dipping sauces for after you cook the food also left much to be desired. Thus, while the hot pot at Soga was adequate, we weren't overly impressed. 

I will say that each entree I've ordered since has been great. 

The wings are perhaps my favorite option here. They're served rather spicy and with sauteed veggies and chopped peanuts. I've then tried the gyoza dumplings as an appetizer, as well as the dry braised chicken in hot pot. No complaints with the dumplings and holy spice on that chicken, in a good way. 

I also ordered delivery once and opted for the ribs stewed with pumpkin, which was impressively portioned and speedily delivered.

While Soga is on the pricier side in terms of Asian food in town, I've found the good food and hearty portions to be worth the extra expense."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,The shabu shabu here has to be one of my favorites. The spicy broth has this amazing delicate flavor while still packing a punch. It's affordable too.
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"So... it's supposed to be a Japanese restaurant but when I went here it was Chinese people and the recommended/served Chinese food. Fine with me.

Steamed chicken smothered in chili oil might be a little gristly, but apparently very Chinese. Also had some delicious combination lo mein. 

Service was fine, fast & friendly. Watched a Vin Diesel movie on the tube and ate my spicy food like a boss."
Soga Shabu Shabu,23. spicy and sour shredded potato bento box,"This was a super great surprise. We heard rumors that there was an authentic shabu shabu spot in Madison.  The rumors were true. Authentic as  authentic gets. I felt like I was back in China. The place was a dive hole in the wall. The waitress spoke limited English. When she took our drink order my friend ordered of the menu and didn't know what a rum and coke was. I felt like I was in China! It was awesome!

We tried the hot broth and the mild. The hot wasn't crazy spicy. It was just right. The fish balls were delicious!"

The food came within a very short time and was beautifully presented, fresh and spicy, and absolutely filling."
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,"I went for hot pot here on a Friday night around 9:30 pm. Overall it was good, and I definitely want to go back. The place was a bit empty, but it did seem like we missed the dinner crowd.

We got the spicy broth and it was perfect. The chicken was a bit dry, but that's probably because we failed and over cooked it. They also had these pork dumpling things that were amazing. Overall the place seemed pretty authentic, and the food was good. I am giving it four stars though because the ambiance just doesn't feel great when you are the only one eating in a restaurant for about half your meal, even if it's a bit late."
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,"I stopped in here on a whim for lunch with a friend. I just ordered the chicken fried rice, so nothing too difficult, but it was delicious. The portions were also huge, and I got a good 2-3 meals out of one order. We also received an unexpected free plate of watermelon for dessert, which I thought was a nice touch! The place was pretty empty, and, while clean, the decor is a bit dated. Overall, it was a pleasing experience, and both my friend and I decided we would visit again."
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,"No idea what the shabu shabu is like here, come for the Chinese though.  In particular order the big plate chicken, it's a chicken/noodle/potato dish that is exquisite.  Also a lamb spicy soup and a beef dish also in a spicy sauce.  I can't recall the names, but you want to order from the special handwritten menu.  Trust me, this is the best Chinese in Madison."
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,"In my few visits to Soga, I've had tasty experiences. A tad pricey experiences, but tasty ones.

My first meal here was with a big group and we settled on hot pot. We'd hosted our own little hot pot party a month or so prior, so I will say that the bar had been set high. A pot of boiling broth arrives to your table along with a bounty of raw veggies and thinly shaved raw meats. Chicken and pork were the selections we made for the night. The concept is fondue-esque, yet you're cooking your meat in broth rather than oil. We found the broth to be dull in flavor and the meat portions to be skimpy. The dipping sauces for after you cook the food also left much to be desired. Thus, while the hot pot at Soga was adequate, we weren't overly impressed. 

I will say that each entree I've ordered since has been great. 

The wings are perhaps my favorite option here. They're served rather spicy and with sauteed veggies and chopped peanuts. I've then tried the gyoza dumplings as an appetizer, as well as the dry braised chicken in hot pot. No complaints with the dumplings and holy spice on that chicken, in a good way. 

I also ordered delivery once and opted for the ribs stewed with pumpkin, which was impressively portioned and speedily delivered.

While Soga is on the pricier side in terms of Asian food in town, I've found the good food and hearty portions to be worth the extra expense."
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,The shabu shabu here has to be one of my favorites. The spicy broth has this amazing delicate flavor while still packing a punch. It's affordable too.
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,"So... it's supposed to be a Japanese restaurant but when I went here it was Chinese people and the recommended/served Chinese food. Fine with me.

Steamed chicken smothered in chili oil might be a little gristly, but apparently very Chinese. Also had some delicious combination lo mein. 

Service was fine, fast & friendly. Watched a Vin Diesel movie on the tube and ate my spicy food like a boss."
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,"Cold harsh winters in Madison, What better way to celebrate it with some shabu shabu (hot pot) ! This place has decent Asian food , and I am not even a picky eater. I haven't tried anything else but I enjoyed my hotpot. My friend and I ordered Chicken and Beef along with some fish balls. The broth was nice . AHHH it really does relax my tummy."
Soga Shabu Shabu,98. spicy and sour chicken,"This was a super great surprise. We heard rumors that there was an authentic shabu shabu spot in Madison.  The rumors were true. Authentic as  authentic gets. I felt like I was back in China. The place was a dive hole in the wall. The waitress spoke limited English. When she took our drink order my friend ordered of the menu and didn't know what a rum and coke was. I felt like I was in China! It was awesome!

We tried the hot broth and the mild. The hot wasn't crazy spicy. It was just right. The fish balls were delicious!"
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"It is with a heavy heart that I must admit my disappointment with this restaurant. 

While on my way back from Eau Claire I had a craving for some Asian fusion, specifically soup. I looked up on Yelp and this place had some great reviews. It was relatively easy to find, and at 2:00 in the afternoon we were one of three tables, expecting great service. 

All the reviews boasted the hot pots were fabulous, so we were excited to see those on the other tables. The menu was a little difficult to read, most things weren't in English, or were ingredients I had never heard of (thank you Wikipedia). 

I ordered a Special Clay Pot, indicating that I was allergic to mushrooms, so to please leave that out - which left bamboo shoots and some green onion in the broth. When it came, she explained to me in broken english that even though it looked and tasted like mushrooms, she insisted it was fine. Well once I spooned through the broth it was COMPLETELY mushrooms...that's it. Obviously I couldn't eat it... she was snotty and took it back finally. I ordered a tofu hot pot (shabu shabu). She didn't explain anything about how it worked to me...just dropped off the pot of broth and a plate with three different kinds of lettuce/cabbage, some noodles, I think it was jicama? And so many things I had no idea what they were! I just kind of threw it in and let it cook. She gave us bowls so we spooned the soup into them. The broth tasted like fishy water, not good at all. The ingredients all turned to a sort of mush. It was disgusting. Once we had given it a valiant effort, we gave up. About this time, every single employee in the restaurant sat down at a table in the dining room and served up a HUGE feast for themselves. James kept signaling for a check, she'd look right at him and ignore him. She even got up three times to refill her food. We watched them eat almost 20 minutes. Finally James got up and went over there. They were shocked. They dropped off the check and never came back. He went up to the front to pay and they told us to go back to our table and wait!

We finally were able to pay (which we shouldn't have had to) and leave.

I am giving a one star rating for the service, which was reprehensible. 

Our waters had no ice, the sauces had a film over the top and crusty spoons/dishes with them. The food was unsavory and the menu was confusing. 

I will give their sushi two and half stars. We had the crazy dragon roll, and despite not having quite enough cream cheese in our opinion, it was very good. 

I am giving Soga the benefit of the doubt according to the rest of the reviews....maybe we caught them on a bad day. A horrible terrible no good very bad day."
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"Not a bad experience. This is more of a Chinese version of the traditional Japanese shabu shabu, and it's Korean cousin. We took the kids who ate well on the seafood fried rice, mostly shrimp with a few bits of squid and octopus. My wife and I shared the two meat combination, and had it spicy. Good level of spice, they didn't hold back because I am Western and assume I couldn't handle the heat. Lots of room for groups of four and some larger groups. Very extensive Chinese menu and noticed most of the customers were Chinese students which was a good sign. Prices are good and the portions are too. We will be back."
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"Second time going to Soga and I can't wait to go back. Actually texted a friend about this place while I was eating telling them they have to come here soon. We had the beef and shrimp shabu shabu and the fried squash and fried taro cakes for dessert. 

The shabu shabu broth is great. It is some combo that includes fish (was told it was bonito) and other spices. Not overpowering. Just delicious. With the broth comes a large plate of beef slices, and a plate of about 8 frozen whole shrimp, as well as the standard vegetables. The veggies may vary a bit but are napa cabbage, enoki mushrooms, shiitake, black mushrooms, fish cake, meatballs, pork dumplings, spinach, some other greens, taro, lotus root, and a nice helping of dried rice noodles (I think).  So these things mixed to your liking, with the broth, are great by themselves. Really the broth can be eaten like a soup it is so good. But, they bring chili paste, chili oil, sesame paste, and a mixture. And that mixture is one of the best condiments I've ever tasted and goes perfectly with whatever you have in your bowl. All for a decent price. Don't overcook things like beef and shrimp, make sure you have a decent mix of veggies and such and this will be a great and relatively cheap meal to share with someone. 

The desserts were a great way to end the meal. We couldn't decide between squash and taro (who could?) and the waiter let us try both. Three cakes the size of sand dollars come on a plate. By cake I mean they are kind of in paste form, then battered and fried with some sesame seeds on top. Neither were too sweet which was perfect since we don't particularly like sweet desserts. Probably an unhealthy option considering they were fried but they didn't feel too unhealthy since they were mostly squash and taro. Will order again and would recommend with enthusiasm. 

We've eaten shabu shabu and have no problems with chopsticks but the waiter was sure to brief us on the whole process and was there to help if we needed anything. Very much appreciated whether it was needed or not. Also, apparently the cakes were homemade, along with everything else. To what extent this is true I cannot vouch but everything we've had here tastes pretty homemade to our non Chinese palates. 

Go here. I've noticed a bunch of places shutting down on state st and others coming in and I hope this one stays around for a while because they have a big menu and I have a lot of stuff to try."
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"Good food aside, their service is mediocre on a very nice day, and as for now, excruciatingly slow. I have a grubhub order put down for 11:10, and the food still hasn't arrived. It is 13:12 right now. The least they could have done is give us a courtesy call to explain why the food isn't arriving for over 40 minutes past the estimated delivery time (they sent me a text saying 12:20), and we had to call twice just to make sure that they hadn't forgotten about us.

If anyone is in the mood for Chinese food that's both good AND offers good service, try Ichiban. At least the lady there knows how to treat their customers. As for me, Soga's lost themselves a regular customer.

To be fair, they serve delicious Chinese food, and anyone visiting their location is in for a treat. What a shame, really."
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"Recently ordered delivery from Soga through Grub Hub and I was very pleased! Grub Hub emails and texts you delivery time and lets you know when your food is out for delivery, which is nice. 

Reasonably priced. The food arrived in nice, tightly-closed containers and was still piping hot. I tried the eggplant with garlic sauce, which was very flavorful and delicious, although a little oily. My friend ordered the shrimp fried rice and enjoyed it. Overall, I'd order from them again. I wish they offered small versions of their soup (all soup was meal-sized)."
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"This was my first time at this restaurant and having shabu shabu. I went w 2 friends. We got the lamb and pork combo and added waygu beef. We got half the pot spicy, half regular, and we added the thick type noodles. There was plenty of food for all 3 of us. We paid $12 something before tip, very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The vegetable selection that came with it was good, also included some fish and pork balls. I had mostly spicy, and added some chili paste. When I had the noodles at the end I had to add a little regular to cool it off, but it was an enjoyable spicy flavor. The taste was phenomenal, I will definitely be back."
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"Great place for large group gatherings. This place is GIGANTIC. you can also make reservations ahead of time! 

Sadly, the service is rather lacking and the quality of hotpot is only so-so. If you speak mandarin, they tend to be more responsive. Still, for hotpot where the customers cook their own food, the service is UNBELIEVABLY slow. had to wait maybe 20 minutes for anyone to come, had to grab my own menus, and then another 30 mins for uncooked ingredients.. The servers look like young Asian undergraduates who are not very experienced, so they don't really know who is serving which table, forget your order, combine your meat orders so you can't tell how many portions there are... yah, I'm obviously not a very happy camper. Also, usually it should be about $12 per person but somehow my bill went up to $21... and I don't even know if I got all my orders.. But since it was Chinese New Year, I didn't make a fuss.

Overall, the ingredients were so-so, but at least you don't get tummy aches after. And you get a variety of spicy chilli and peanut sauce to dip your hotpot cooked food in. Also, I like the udon noodles better than glass noodles, much more substantial meal. And, one of the HUGE fishballs are teochew fishballs, which come stuffed with minced meat (my favorite!!). Oh, before I forget, they actually had hand made steamed pork dumplings, VERY GOOD. although they look like plain soggy things, they were very well marinated and didn't even need vinegar or soy sauce to pair with!

They also have stir fry, which looked pretty good cos you can constantly see real fire in the kitchen POOFING away. so I might give that a try, sometime, maybe.

If you wanna visit, don't come hungry, and be patient!"
Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"I stopped in here on a whim for lunch with a friend.

Soga Shabu Shabu,137. rice noodles with black curded bean and pepper,"Soga Restaurant just opened a few months ago in an upstairs restaurant location.  Their specialty is shabu shabu, a cook your own food items in a grill or soup hotplate. However, their lunch menu has some really tasty items that are under $10 - good for the student State Street crowd. The shabu shabu can be shared among 2-3 people. 

I ordered their tomato egg drop soup - it was really huge, and came with a side of steamed white glutinous rice. Others at my table ordered the shabu shabu of which there are dozens upon dozens of combination ingredients (mushroom, thin sliced beef, water chestnuts, Chinese veggies, etc.). Another person ordered their garlic eggplant dish which seemed better than average.  Service was really good.

There's a bar in the back and I can see how the vision for this place was for it to be a late night, classy restaurant with nice curtains, nice tables and chairs, with a nice second floor view. I'm definitely coming back here to try their other items.

The lunch food reminded me of the much praised Sezchuan restaurant on Park St, Ichiban, but with the geographic advantage of being on State Street."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I've only had the food from here once and it was delivery.  I like how delivery is online, that is great for me.  The green beans with garlic that I heard so much about was good but they were ice cold (on purpose).  I didn't dig that so much.  The flavor was good though, a little greasy but good.  The general tso's chicken was super good and I felt good after eating it.  It's okay.  I would consider eating there again in house since I hear so many good things about it."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The Sichuan dishes on their menu are full-on spicy, so you have been warned. One of my favorite dishes is their chili garlic eggplant. It's medium spicy and has a delicious garlicky flavor. I've ordered online twice and picked up my food and eaten at the restaurant once. The food comes out super quick (about 5 minutes) but  doesn't taste like they took any short cuts. They have a huge menu, so it might be hard to make a choice, but any choice you make is bound to be delicious."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Tried 2 new dishes tonight. The Cumin Flavored Beef with Chili Sauce, and the Fried Shredded Beef in Chili Sauce. Both were excellent! The fried was slightly more spicy. 
The Cumin Beef was very fragrant with cumin, but the flavor was not overwhelming. Just right.
The Fried beef was small strips, coated in chili seeds, with lots of the dried red chilies on the platter, and Sichuan peppercorns. Very yummy!  
We were sweating by the time we were done eating, so my craving for spicy this evening was hit right on the spot!  Gotta love it when a craving is satisfied!
I would recommend both dishes.
I would also like to slip in a comment here about the staff.  Every single time we've been there, they have been absolutely excellent.  They have been very helpful, and answered all our questions, and took the time to tell us their favorite dishes. .  Couldn't ask for better!  
We are now recognized as soon as we walk in, and they even remember what we usually order, and put it in for us as soon as we walk in, if we confirm that is what we want.  Our previous wait staff always makes a point to stop by & say ""Hi"" if they are not waiting on us that night  
We just love going there!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Amazing authentic Sichuan Chinese food!! Don't come here if you're expecting your typical Americanized Chinese food, because they specialize in the typically spicy Sichuan cooking.

My personal favorites include the dry braised chicken with spicy sauce in hot pot (under gan guo), the spicy shredded potato, ox tongue (be adventurous! it's so good), and twice cooked pork.

Seriously the best REAL Chinese food I've had in Madison. A real local treasure."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The Japanese name is a bit of a fooler, and kept me from visiting for a while.  It wasn't until I noted on the sign the Chinese characters for ""Sichuan"" that I realized what this place actually was.

What it is, is pretty danged good.

The menu isn't the standard American-chinese fare of sweet-and-sour or sesame meat.  While you can find a few entrees of the tamer variety (orange beef, for example) most of the menu is regional Sichuan and Hunan specialties.  The first item on the menu is a ""spicy ox tongue"" appetizer, so that should be enough to let you make an informed decision.

Much, but not all of the food is of the spicy kind.  There's a whole section of the menu devoted to dishes made with pickled chilies, and another one for the Sichuan classic ""boiled [meat] in spicy sauce.""  Also available are the more hunan-style ""dry-braised"" dishes, as well as many other entrees sorted by protein.  

The food is, put simply, good.  It's hearty, bold, filling, and generally well-prepared.  The cumin beef, one of my personal favorites, is spicy without being overpowering, and nicely redolent of cumin.  The ""boiled pork in  spicy sauce"" is well-prepared; this sort of dish can easily be made too greasy, seasoned improperly, or padded-out with cabbage, but on none of the occasions I've tried it has it been anything other than a well-balanced mix of chili, garlic, meat and vegetable in a rich, stew-like sauce.  The ""beef with ginger and scallion"" is rich, not spicy, and full of garlic and ginger.  The Dan Dan noodle appetizer is a simple bowl of noodles with a rich sauce of ground pork, chilis, scallion and garlic that is quite satisfying as an appetizer, and is nearly a meal in itself.

The only strangeness with the preparations is the surprisingly low incidence of Sichuan pepper.  The dishes are good without it, but their seasoning leans more towards the Hunan than the Sichuan without the numbing fruitiness of the little flower peppers.   

The translations on the menu may be a little confusing for some with their literal interpretations - ordering a ""braised vegetable"" dish doesn't immediately inform you that it is a single braised vegetable (bok choi, which admittedly is a classic braised vegetable dish), and the Tofu with Black Mushroom is simply lots of tofu with a few slices of black mushroom.  

The service has generally been good, albeit not great.  A few times they've forgotten to bring beverages or misinterpreted an order.  Never anything major, they've always accepted their errors, and I've never had an actual bad experience, but it is an area that needs a bit of improvement."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Stopped in while passing through Madison. Definitely not your ordinary food court Chinese food. The menu is much more authentic and has an overwhelming amount of options. It reminds me of Hong Kong Noodle, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants back in Minneapolis. All of the dishes looked and smelled salty and delicious, just what I was craving. 

My girlfriend and I were able to order off the lunch specials menu which featured many popular items from the menu at a very decent price. We split an order of Kung Pao Chicken, and also an order of Red Curry Chicken. The dishes came out fast and looked mouthwatering. The Kung Pao Chicken had a lot of flavor and included peanuts (one of my favorite parts) and some sort of chile but no other vegetables. The chicken seemed poor quality. It felt a little mushy and slightly slimy. I don't think it tasted as good as it looked, I got a little sick of that dish by the end. The red curry chicken was not fried and the the chicken looked and tasted of much better quality. The curry came with the chicken along with an assortment of vegetables all covered in the red curry sauce. The curry tasted good but lacked enough flavor, I thought the dish could have been a little more powerful. Those are my favorite curries. It was a good cheap lunch if you're looking for some Chinese in the area."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We ordered delivery from Ichiban the other day. 
We got:
Green bean appetizer. Very good. 
Dumplings: BAD. Badbadbad. I'm positive they were a brand of frozen dumplings I used to buy at Woodman's. 
Spring rolls: Soft and not flavorful. I'm willing to bet these were also frozen. 
Rice: I thought the rice was good. Sticky and thick grains. Not typical of the asian delivery I'm used to. 
Cashew Chicken: Bland. My boyfriend didn't like it and I ended up eating most of it because my dish was almost inedible. 
San Bei Chicken: Decent flavor but nothing to rave about. I googled this dish before ordering and the ingredients sounded delicious. I found chunks of ginger and garlic in my dish and that's great. I wasn't prepared for bone shards and slivers. I know San Bei chicken is made by chopping chicken bits up and cooking them with spices/sauce so I was prepared for full on bone chunks but NOT for slivers. Actual slivers and splinters of bone wrapped up in chicken made eating this dish impossible and dangerous. I spent 20 minutes picking the bones out of my food and ended up with a bowl full of rice and sauce. I was very upset by this. 

We ended up throwing the food away because there just wasn't a point to eating it anymore.  I would have had the rest of the chicken for breakfast, but biting down on bone bits isn't appetizing. 

I am especially disappointed because of all the raving reviews on Yelp and Grubhub. This food wasn't good and we wont be ordering from or eating here again."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"If you love spicy food, this is the place to go. They have legitimate Sichuan Chinese food that my family and I love. They can make any dish spicy and still taste unique and delicious. The prices are also reasonable, and the serving sizes are quite generous as well. One of the better Chinese restaurants in town."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I would give the taste a 4 star at least. However not long after eaten here, my wife was sick within hours. It was obviously food poisoning. Would I come back again? Probably. But definitely not ordering the same dish again. Still a die hard spicy food fan."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Had takeout from here: dan dan noodles and poached pork with extra rice.

First of all that was way too much food for one person and it easily stretched into 5 meals: the noodles are more than enough for two dinners and the pork with the rice can make 3 lunches. Next time I'll add an order of some kind of stir fried greens and make a more balanced series of meals ;)

The noodles themselves were delicious. They were thicker tan most dan dan noodles I had and seemed fresh. The sauce was deliciously spicy without being overwhelming.
The poached pork was irresistibly tender. I loved every bite of it. It came with a  very spicy szchuan pepper sauce that went great with the rice (you need the white rice to absorb some of that spiciness) and complemented the subtle sweetness of the pork.

Now I am debating whether I should order more or try to figure out the recipe... Maybe I'll order, last time delivery was super quick!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The name is confusing but it's a Sze Chuan Chinese restaurant, meaning its best dishes are really spicy.

I'd say the food is comparable to Fugu. To be honest (and don't kill me!), I don't notice a huge difference.

BUT, I will say that Ichiban does a MUCH better boiled beef dish than Fugu. A seasoned Sze Chuan chef drops dead every time Fugu makes that dish. Kidding. Kind of. Ichiban's version tops Fugu's bastardized one every damn time.

So if you like boiled beef (and if you haven't tried it, go for it! Its Chinese name literally translates to ""water-boiled beef"" though that is SO misleading because it's jam-packed with spicy chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Be sure to drink some milk afterwards), go to Ichiban. Go out of your way to go to Ichiban. Other than that, if you have to choose between Fugu and Ichiban, go with whichever one is closer."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We went to Ichiban's for lunch. For appetizers my wife and I ordered spring rolls. They were hot and crisp, but bland. For my entree I ordered twice cooked pork and my wife had crispy spicy chicken. My pork was a very solid entree. Nice ginger undertones to a spicy mix of veggies and thinly sliced pork. The sauce was a little thin in flavor, but the pepper flakes have a nice kick. My wife's chicken was inundated with hot peppers. The chicken was good, but could have been better with a sauce. Overall a very solid meal."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Did this place undergo new management? I haven't been here in at least 6 months and noticed immediately upon walking in that they've done a remodel. The walls are now red and they've got booths along one side. They kept the same old tattered menus, however, that looked like they can fall apart any minute. 

I was craving their Dan Dan noodles and it's definitely different now. Instead of spicy Sichuan goodness, this version is closer to Thai peanut noodles. Not entirely unappetizing but not what I was expecting at all. I felt robbed!

The lunch special green curry with beef was a large portion. There was a generous amount of beef in there, along with black shiitake mushrooms, red bell peppers, snow peas and onions. My son seemed happy enough with it but I tasted it and it was also different from what I recalled in the past. 

The chicken lo mein was average, not any better than a Chinese take out place. Same with the pork potstickers. The last dish that we got, scallion pancakes, was probably the best dish of our meal. It came in 8 large wedge shaped pieces and while greasy, had good flavor. I did find it weird that the waitress didn't bring out a sauce for it and she seemed confused when I asked for one. We ended up using the dipping sauce from the potstickers and that worked fine. 

Bottom line, given all these changes, this place no longer distinguishes itself as one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants in Madison. It's now just like any of the dozen quick take out places in town but with higher prices.

Edit: found out why the green curry ""lunch"" portion was generous. Even though we pointed out the item clearly to the waitress on the lunch menu, she ordered it as a dinner item. So of course we got charged $12 instead of $7.50 and when I pointed this out to her, she just shrugged and did not offer to make any adjustments on the price or at the very least apologize. Another reason to not come back."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I have been to this restaurant twice now and I have yet to have bad food. Both times I have been with another person and we swapped lots of food. Everything is pretty spicy but I was also able to order very traditional meals while there. The wait staff is young, but friendly without hovering. The atmosphere is low lit and quiet enough to enjoy a conversation with your food. The food is absolutely outstanding. I can't wait to go back for a third time and try something new."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"It took me a while to get back, I did find a house in the neighborhood and I have found some 'good taste' food around town. My S.U. and I had to abort a fish fry excursion at the last minute and I knew she would love this place. Her comment was, ""This was the first place you ate in Madison and it took you this long to come back??!!?"". This is clearly one notch above anything else in Madison. The menu covers many classics and even a few non-Chinese dishes. The decor is open, no kitsch. The place is big so you'll always get seated. Reasonable drink prices. What's not to love?

This night we tried the scallion pancakes, the cumin beef, salt and pepper squid and a sautee spinach. The cumin beef was great, solid spice but not overpowering. The squid (not spicy) was served on a bed of puffed bean-thread noodles with bits of different colored sweet peppers, beautiful and tasty!  All the plates are quite large, we took half the stuff home, be warned. Bring friends so you can try more.

This place is Ichiban (!), in my book."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Having visited on two occasions, I definitely recommend this place for some yummy Sichuan cuisine.

For those first time visitors, have confidence as you go in. I'm not sure what is typical but I just grabbed some menus and sat my party down at a table of my choice. If no one directs you as you walk in, just do it yourself.

FYI, look for the slightly numbing/tingling feeling the spicy dishes do to your mouth. This is the famous sichuan pepper and provides a unique and (I think) a pleasurable experience, much more complexity than just being a 'hot' addition.

The dishes I've tried are as follows (additional comments are further on):
-ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce
-sichuan dan dan noodles
-ma po tofu
-eggplant with chili garlic sauce
-homestyle twice cooked pork
-seafood soup
-raspberry smoothie with bubbles (tapioca pearls - a nice chewy surprise)

I look forward to visiting again and giving a go to my first Hotpot experience. If your coming here, don't order sesame chicken or general tso. From what I've know, that's not Chinese food. Get the real stuff and expand your horizons. If you need a suggestion to get you going, order the twice cooked pork. That is a very popular choice. 

Also, 1 dish per person (and share!!!) is plenty but and extra one or two is fun for diversity (you can bring home the extra!)


Here is other info:
ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce: if you haven't had tongue you could be in for a treat. Tongue is a common food in many cultures. When prepared right it is very tender and tasty.

sichuan dan dan noodles: a very nice spicy noodle dish. I really enjoyed it though having a noodle dish as an appetizer is different for me... it seems too filling so feel free to try it as a entree, it is large enough

ma po tofu: a spicy and slightly thickened chili sauce with pork (optional) and tofu. goes excellently with rice

eggplant with chili garlic sauce: the eggplant has a nice sweetness to it. quite good

homestyle twice cooked pork: Delicious! So tender and bursting with flavor. The 'homestyle' version includes little buns to eat with the meat. I would definitely recommend the twice cooked pork though I would not say it is necessary get the buns.

seafood soup: this was alright... not quite my favorite."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,Solid Asian food. Good spicy chicken.
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Hands down WORST Chinese food I have ever had. Seriously over priced,  $70+for two adults and a kid to eat!  Seriously?! We ordered online for delivery. They called and said one of the items we ordered was not available, they offered spicy chicken,  I told them it was for a child and they responded that they would not make it spicy,  well, pretty much the whole bowl was szechuan peppers with a couple pieces of spicy chicken. My husband ordered guozi which was tripe soup. Not what he wad expecting.  The general tso tofu was ok,  I've had much better from cheaper places. I don't recommend this place at all. Just bad."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Protip: Do not wear a white shirt when you go to eat here. Cause it's chili peppers and hot sauce galore and you will get some on your shirt.

I love coming here for their lunch specials. $7.50 for about 30 different items. 

I have had the L17 which is Noodle w/ spare ribs and chili sauce. It is served as a soup dish even though it doesn't list as a soup. Every bite you take your mouth will be coated in chili flakes. If that's your thing awesome, I guess it's sorta my thing. I love the spiciness, maybe not the constant choking though. The L14 Noodle with Hot special beef. It is very similiar, noodles in soup, some veggies, and cilantro (love the cilantro touch!). I think I prefer this dish because the cuts of beef seem a little bigger and more satisfying. The other dish with the spare ribs can be a little cumbersome.

The twice cooked pork is basically bacon. Lots and lots of bacon in chili sauce. I love bacon. But I felt guilty eating this much bacon. 

The sichaun style cucumber is a refreshing appetizer. Cool and crunchy but spicy snack.

I've enjoyed most items here but the two dishes that I've gotten that I would probably pass on next time would be the walnut shrimp. This dish is a bout 15 or 16 dollars and was medicore. The broccoli was simply steamed with no spices and the shrimp is coated in like sweet and sour chicken batter but there were only a few pieces. The scallion pancakes appetizer wasn't particularly amazing, I've had better.

I hope to go there one day with about 2 other people to do their hot pot! It should be a lot of fun I think. And they allow you to split the pot into two broths. One spicy and one regular."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Ichiban is an excellent restaurant. The diners are almost all Chinese. I want to try everything but get timid when it comes time to order. The menu is huge and I cannot really tell what the dish is like before it arrives. The waitstaff speaks limited English and are unable to really help you out.

 I have been to Ichiban 3 times and each time I have enjoyed my meal. The food can be very oily but that is the case at Fugu as well, another authentic Chinese restaurant. Vegetables are fresh and crispy, tofu light and puffy and the sauces are diverse rather than everything tasting the same. My guy ordered the Cumin Flavored beef with Chili Sauce which was our least favorite dish. I have enjoyed the Sichuan sauce twice, once with chicken and once with tofu. I loved the Japanese Tofu in Hot Pot, Braised Vegetable with Shitake Mushroom and the Vegetable Dumplings. 

You must give Ichiban a try. i have never waited more than 10 minutes for my food to arrive.  I am hellbent on spending an evening there just interviewing folks about what they are eating.  I love moo-shu pork but this is a whole different ballgame."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The food from ichiban was fantastic, save for the veggie dumplings, which where pretty much cold, two of the six were stale and rock hard on the edges and the dipping sauce was nothing like a dumpling sauce but like a vinegar/soy mix (bleh!)... BUT that was the only bad part of our meal!  Despite that they were out of spinach and my GF had to order something different (this was for delivery), the tofu and black mushrooms was excellant and flavorful.   The Tofu and Greens Soup was tasty as well, but I think its not 100% vegetarian, as the broth seemed more like a meat broth?  Im not positive because I did not ask.  I may the next time.  The Orange Chicken was AWESOME!  Perhaps the best I have had in town.  I believe this is what actual orange chicken may be like in Asia, with the orange rinds, garlic chunks, red chilis, and such that it was not super sweet like the pan-asian/Americanized dish that everyone is more familiar with. This was an excellant flavor experience!  Delivery was FAST!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I recently moved to Madison from Atlanta and was craving good Chinese food. This place really hit the spot. 
Madison doesn't have a dedicated neighborhood known for Asian food (i.e Chinatown), so I wasn't sure where to look. I'm so relieved to have found this gem. It's authentic, spicy, Szechuan style food. While they do deliver, I definitely wouldn't put this place in the same category as a typical Chinese-American delivery/fast food place.  The steamed fish is especially good. If you don't enjoy spicy foods though, you probably won't enjoy this place. 
I would recommend getting one dish per person and sharing family style (having your own rice bowl and sharing the other plates). I usually get three dishes for two people so I can have leftovers."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"For once, a recommendation for a Chinese restaurant in Madison came through for me.  The food at Ichiban is not the best Chinese that I've ever had, but it's certainly at a different level from what you might find in Madison.  

We went and had a vermicelli with minced pork, eggplant with garlic sauce, and the spicy chicken dish.  The spicy chicken dish was very good if you like some heat in your food.  I found the eggplant with garlic sauce somewhat oily, but it went well with some rice.

This place is the best Chinese I've had in Madison.  It's rather pricey, but it's not your typical Chinese takeout food and it's worth it.  Come here if you want to expand your culinary experience of Chinese food to more than just General Tso' chicken and orange chicken and be prepared to enjoy some spice."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Sichuan is a region in China known for hot babes. If you know a thing or two about what brings the heat you know that you need the whole package. Pretty and smart gets it done. Taking one without the other you're either shallow or a chump.

You'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere. These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden. Who likes that place? (I do. Kind of a lot. I think?). You'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or pickled soup. I am a big fan, and their spicy crispy chicken is my jam. The only thing I got here that I didn't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it didn't pack much heat and the sauce was thick and sweet. I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.

So what kind of babe is Ichiban? Obviously she's the brainy one that doesn't care what you think. I kinda wish she did, though."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Had to doc Ichiban one star because they forgot the rice with my delivery order; however, I called the restaurant, they called the driver, and delivered the rice within 20 minutes.

I ordered the green beans with garlic...amazing!!! Unfortunately, they were a little cold when they arrive but still delicious. I also had the eggplant with chili sauce. Spicy and delicious! 

I will definitely order from Ichiban again. Easy online ordering and quick delivery. Hopefully they won't forget the rice next time!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The food was very good. However, I want to talk about the man delivering the food.
1. NEVER said any polite words such as ""hello, bye and thank you"". (Not just me, I've asked several friends. They had similar experience.)
2. HANG up my phone before finishing talking.
3. LET me going out for dozens of meters to get the delivery with short sleeve and short pant when it was snowing heavily (about -5 F). AND he was unwillingly to walk towards me.
4. ALWAYS complain about the tips with really really bad temper. (I usually give about 10%)"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"What a disappointment. Got fooled by Japanese name. As soon as you walk in the door, a sign of today's special all written in Chinese. Should have checked Yelp first. Or walked out. Service very slow even though we came late for lunch. Ordered green tea. No taste and not hot. Chopsticks, another sign, not Japanese. Music is also Chinese. Well we ordered any way, too late if day to go somewhere else. I just still can't understand why you have to trick people like this with the name. Looks like they are going to try to do sushi, they have a sushi cooler but right now has fruit or something in it. Not fish. 
Food came same time as soup. Mom ordered garlic beef not spicy. Came without garlic. I order Shicuan beef, it was ok, not the best. It took a while before server came to ask how we were doing. When we explained about the garlic, server took the plate, came back with a woman who just couldn't understand what was wrong. My food got cold explaining. Then finally offered to make new. Rice is also Chinese. Lots of it and dry. The server is very nice and well mannered guy. But I dont think we will be back.
   I'd to explain my "" pickiness"" when it comes to Japanese food. My mother is Japanese, I'm half, born there. My husband is Japanese. 
If are going to be serving Chinese or something other then what you lead the customers to believe, you are totally Fake!  We cook Japanese food at home but it is nice to get out of cooking and have someone else cook it and serve with a smile. 
If I want Chinese, I go to Chinese. If I want American , I go to eat American food. If I want African, same. I just don't get it. You might be able to fool some people , but eventually , the causes you are making will catch with you. I didn't even want to give this place an one star. Just as bad as the Edo down the street. Why people? Do you keep on getting fooled , if you pay cheap, you get what you pay for."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"*Review for takeout only*

3.5 stars but there is no ""half"" option on Yelp. My friends have ordered here a couple of times. I would say that that the food is definitely Szechuan stile and full of spices and chili peppers, which I love. 

Things that we have tried are: fried oxtail, ox tongue, lo mein and another type of noodle, szechaun beef, kung pao chicken, and Szechuan beef. The first time we ordered, the food took a very very long time to come, but the second time was more reasonable (maybe 45 minutes or so?). I do appreciate that they do delivery though, so not a huge deal. My friend is an adventurous eater and recommended the oxtail and tongue and they were actually very well done. Very tasty.

Everything is deliciously spicy but very very oily, so keep that in mind; you will definitely not feel great afterwards. I would say that the more Szechuan dishes were all delicious and probably a 5/5 stars. The more ""Americanized"" dishes (such as lo mein, chicken, etc.) were mediocre at best, so this is not the place to go if this is the type of Chinese food you're looking for. 

I think really, for me, the reason why it is only around 3.5 stars is because the portions are very small for the prices (for $15 an entrée, about half of the entrée was just chili peppers for several of them each time). Things may be different in the restaurant perhaps, so don't let my review stop you from trying it out if you like big, bold spices!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This was my first time to this restaurant. We ordered 3 dishes and the first came rather quickly. The eggplant with garlic sauce had really thick skin so it probably wasn't fresh. After we finished the first dish and the rice has gone cold, they still haven't served the other 2 dishes. They served several other tables that arrived after us. After we asked the waitress 3 times, they finally served the last two dishes. The beef was very salty and quite dry. Both the food and experience were disappointing."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I used to visit this restaurant with my friends a lot in college. Even now It's my third year since I moved to HK, I still miss the spicy food and good times here. Recommended."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Hate to do this, but I should probably report on my subpar Kung Pao chicken lunch special.  It was supposed to be spicy, but it had big chunks of peppers, which made it hard to eat.  Also, there was some strong ginger and one other ingredient that I really didn't like.  But worst of all, it was just really low quality, fatty chicken.  I threw two thirds of it out."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Our experience at Ichiban Sichuan on a Friday evening (early-ish), was...in a word...annoying. 

The service is the main reason this place is just two stars for me. The food would get three or four stars.

The decor of this place is a bit tacky, and it was pretty cold inside - I don't think it was well insulated. Several of the people that were eating there kept on their coats. Also, the music they were playing when we first came in included a slow-piano and violin version of the Happy Birthday song and other weird versions of cheesy songs. Not the coolest.
 
Our waitress was very nice and clearly wanted to please us, but unfortunately it didn't turn out right. First, she started us off with two glasses of water - one of which had a lipstick print on the side and clearly had not been washed. It made me wonder about the attentiveness to cleanliness there. She apologized and replaced the water glass quickly, however.

Then, having recently gone on a diet, I asked whether or not it was possible to get Kung Pao chicken NOT-fried.  She said yes, of course, nodding her head vigorously.  When the dish came (in pretty good time, I guess), the chicken was indeed fried.

My BF and I had ordered both the Kung Pao Chicken dish and the spicy green beans dish to share, which we made clear to the waitress. But the spicy green beans came out about 40 minutes afterwards. I was afraid we wouldn't even have time to eat it. While we were waiting for that dish, we had asked our waitress to check on it twice, which she said she did and that they were working on it in the kitchen.

And this is probably the most picky comment, but several of the waitresses (younger ones, ours included) were literally running around the place when a larger crowd came. They looked extremely stressed out.  I'm not sure if there was some unique situation happening behind the scenes, or if they had just hired a bunch of new wait staff, but it stressed me out seeing them so stressed out.

Anyway, I might get delivery from them in the future, but the in-person experience left a lot to be desired."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I am very pleased to have this place in my neighborhood. 
And my bf and I probably ordered the right things - sounds like what you order decides 5 star vs 1 star. 

Knowing that they are Sichuan restaurant, we ordered Cold mushroon (Enoki) in spicy sauce, Cold eggplant in spicy sauce, and the house speciality - Fish in spicy sauce. All of them were EXCELLENT - and I mean it. 

To me, the biggest selling point was their use of right spices. That clearly differentiated Ichiban from other Americanized grease-heavy crap I see in Madison. I felt like this is the food they'd eat, and that definitely translated in the menu."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I chose this place because of the review level and they deliver.  I chose a $20 entree for lunch, ""Cocktail Shrimp with Chili Sauce"" .  The shrimp still have their heads and shells on.  Who eats ""Cocktail Shrimp"" with their full shell and heads??? this is disgusting and a total waste of my $20.  No where on the menu does it say that these are unpeeled shrimp.  Its a bummer because i'm freaking starving but do not eat shrimp heads or legs and these are too messy to peel.   Not for an American Audience for sure, at least tell us the shrimps are not peeled.  ICK.

Note:  i edited the review because the manager personally contacted me, and YELP refunded my money.   The sauce tasted good but I'm not going to be eating shrimp shells."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I used to go to Fugu in Gilman St. for dinner. I was excited when Ichiban was opened. The first couple of times, this restaurant was OK. 
The last two times, the food is not acceptable for the price. The salt and pepper octopus was not fresh and smelly and the chicken was very soft and did not taste like chicken at all. Last weekend my in-law came from out of town and my whole family went to Ichiban for dinner. My in-law ordered Lobster with ginger and scallion. It was a BIG MISTAKE. The lobster must have been frozen for months and the meat tasted awful and rotten. I confronted the owner and she admitted the lobster was not fresh. How can a restaurant serve the customer with rotten food!? I realize now the restaurant tries to cover up the inferior quality of the meat with heavy use of salt and hot pepper. But it would not work with customer with taste. It was a bad experience. I will never ever go back again!!!!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This place was a saving grace for me. Being from out of town and being used to a plethora of Asian cuisine being everywhere, I  couldn't believe how there were so few authentic Chinese places. It's like there is a drought of authentic Chinese cuisine and thankfully this was the ONLY watering hole. Their string bean with garlic dish is always a go to dish along with the ox tongue and tripe. The double cooked pork was great. The spicy crispy chicken and beef brisket hot pot was definitely a favorite with the chicken just being spicy enough and succulent. And last but not least, the spicy crispy fish as well. I really hope this place thrives so if I ever have to come back, this will be my go to place to feel at home."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I ordered the Spicy Crispy Shrimp and the Kung Pao Chicken. The crispy shrimp was not to my liking. The sauce was extremely oily and greasy and I tasted cinnamon which I did not care for at all. The kung pao was only ok and also very oily. There was something off about the taste. What a waste of $30.

Not only was the food terrible but my delivery driver had some nerve to text me a picture of the receipt after claiming I didn't tip him well enough. The funny part was that it was an honest mistake. I realized later that some of the money blew off the table to the ground when I opened the door but I didn't realize it until after I got the very RUDE text from the driver. I work in the service industry and it certainly sucks to not get tipped properly but I would NEVER be so rude as to send a text to the customer. Ichiban has permanently lost a customer and i'm disgusted."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We ate here, named Ichiban Restaurant on the awning, on Christmas day 2012.  The place was pretty packed with big tables, so I understand they may have been pushed near capacity.  However, things were not great.  The hectic restaurant has very shaky, hollow floors.  As the waitstaff stomped around, the table shook quite a bit, making for an uncomfortable dining experience.  Several tables around us were complaining amongst themselves as we waited for our food.  Not a good sign.

We ordered some staples. MaPo Tofu, Pad Thai, and a Cold mushroom app per yelper recommendation.  The MaPo was pretty good if incredibly salty, but the Pad Thai was pretty gross, with a strong bell pepper forward flavor and absolutely smothered in a pretty gross tomatoey sauce.  The sauce was reminiscent of Chef Boyardee canned products.  So, ok, the Thai dish at the Chinese restaurant wasn't that good.  Whatever.  

However, we never received the appetizer, but were charged for it, and no wait staff ever returned to our table.  Our water was never filled.  We weren't really able to tell who was supposed to be our server.

With all these positive reviews, I hope that if I ever make it back here they live up to their reputation."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,The Kung Pao and the eggplant were both spicy and tasty if a little oily.  I looked around and noticed no overweight lunchers despite that.  The lunch portions were smaller and correspondingly cheaper.  The space was quiet and pleasant.
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This place is pretty authentic as to all the spicy Sichuan dishes comparatively to other Chinese restaurants in town. 

Just don't expect any good service.  If anything prepare to have your utensils tossed on your table,  water cups overflown, and dishes to arrive in unprecedented manner. 

The prices are a bit of a sticker shock for a Chinese establishment,  the are comparable to Peking Palace or PF Chang's,  but as others have echoed,  the portions are huge.  

I love the mapo tofu,  west lake beef soup,  dan dan noodles,  steamed chicken slices in chili oil sauce,  spicy garlic string beans,  fried rice,  and gyoza.

They have hot pots!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Definitely my go-to for Chinese delivery in Madison. I haven't enjoyed all of the dishes I've ordered from them, but the Ma Po Tofu and spicy string beans are so amazing that we rarely order from any other place. Spicy and delicious."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Wow - so Marissa and I have lived about 8 blocks from this little gem and have finally found it!

I was highly impressed by almost everything - the only negative I could say was that maybe the food came out too fast? I guess all things considered that is a pretty small problem. Seriously though the food came out in less than 5 minutes which really worked out well for us as we were in a bit of a hurry but others may not be happy with that.

I had Tofu with Shitake Mushrooms extra spicy and Marissa ordered the Mapo Tofu which was also fabulous. We could have simply ordered one of these dishes as along with the Seaweed Salad and Vegatable Dumplings which was way more than we could finish in one sitting.

This is going to be our new GO-TO place for our Chinese cravings!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We stooped for our first time for an early dinner.  The menu was huge and filled with a variety of items that caught our attention for the good and for the bad (ie everything with intestine).

We were less than daring and ordered three items.  

We tried to order pan fried dumplings but the waiter redirected us to the pot stickers.  Good advice.   They were perfect.  We then asked for entree recommendations.  The first was a beautiful looking and quite tasty beef ginger and scallion plate.  The second dish of chicken and basil was quite tasty but the chicken pieces were splintered with bones and difficult if not dangerous to eat!  

Overall the taste and quality of it all was very good and we will go back.  We will not order anything from the chicken portion of the menu."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"A relatively big Chinese restaurant in Madison. Food are all classical Sichuan cuisines and are all very delicious (a little spicy though, to a Chinese from south China). Very good for a group of people having a dinner together since Ichiban has a big room and many big tables. Food amount for each dish also seems appropriate: 5 dishes were enough to feed us 6 people. One thing really impressive to me is that even in a Friday night like today with maybe more than 50 or more people dining in, we could have our dishes within 10 minutes after we placed our order. Our waitress was also very nice and filled in our water cup frequently. Overall 5 stars :)"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"3 star is being nice.  I was here last month with colleagues from the office.  We ordered quite a variety to share.  The Mao pao tofu was delicious that day!  Couldn't wait to come back to have it again. 

Back today with the family for lunch...boy were we disappointed.  Ou Mao pao tofu had so much food enhancer my hubby and I could feel our lips tingling.  Not a good feeling.  Out beef lomein was greasy(especially since I asked for less oil).  The Chinese vegetable dish with fresh garlic was blah...lack favor & salt.  Where can we go for good healthy flavorful Chinese food????"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My wife and I stopped in for lunch, read the great reviews on Yelp and since we were in the neighborhood thought we would give it a try. We ordered Fried rice, Orange Shrimp and General Tso's chicken. The Orange shrimp was fantastic, large shrimp and the sauce was just spicy right. Friend rice and General Tso's chicken also had great flavor and the portions are large. 

As others have mentioned the prices are high. Our lunch with tip was $43.00!! $1.75 for a cup of Tea??!! 

Overall, the food is great, the atmosphere nice and the service average."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Visited for lunch with a few coworkers.  Ordered the General T'so Chicken off of the $7.50 lunch menu (11-3, M-F) and it was fantastic!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The sauce was complex and I could see & taste the peppers, garlic and ginger.  My coworkers ordered the Black Bean Sauce with Pork and the Sichuan Sauce with Chicken and both tasted great.  The veggies in their dishes were fresh and crisp.

Waitstaff was friendly and attentive, filling my water when needed.  I will be returning, hopefully often."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The Chinese food there is authentic to me a native Chinese, however there are some downside that just balance the good part out. 

1. The service is bad. Water didn't get refilled. The rice came long after the entree. 
2. I find the chicken pork there are in normal quality, but not the beef! I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup on the other day. The beef cubes were very hard to chew, seem to come from the bone junctions or who-knows-where parts of a cow (hoofs or intestines?). It tasted like the elastic band. I could even see the white artery tubes sticking out of the meat. Yak."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This place definitely satisfied my chinese sichuan food cravings. Why it starts with a japanese phase...i'm not sure but it could be considered number one for madison chinese food. We came with a party of 12 and it was easy to make a reservation as well as order a ton of food to try. We did family style and ordered; poached fish, crispy chicken, won tons, eggplant in garlic sauce, green beans, rice, broiled pork belly, tripe, salt and pepper shrimp, and kung pao chicken. i honestly probably forgot some items since we ordered so much, but it was great! We all helped ourself to the food and it came out in succession and fed us all to a good level. I highly recommend the eggplant as it is one of my favorite dishes of all time. 

Happy Eating!!!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I've ordered from here probably six times. The first two times were A+++ experiences and I thought the food was excellent. In addition, they actually followed my instructions for spicy food, which I viewed as a huge plus.

Since then, the quality of the food has really dipped. I cannot get them to give me spicy/hot food anymore. I don't know what happened there, but I assure you that I know what I'm asking for when I ask for spicy/hot food. I really, really loathe going to (or ordering from) a restaurant, asking for spicy food, and getting totally bland (or even worse, sweet) food. Just because this is the midwest and just because I have a totally whitebread name doesn't mean I can't take the heat.

In addition, the quality of the food itself has dropped. I rarely order noodle dishes because usually they are disappointing, but I decided to try them here. The noodles were overcooked and falling apart even though they were supposedly ""pan fried"". This may indeed be the best Chinese in Madison, but that just means that there's no good Chinese food in Madison. From now on, I'll go to the Laotian or Vietnamese places on Willy Street."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"This was my 1st time in Madison and for some odd reason I felt a tingling need to satisfy my urge for spicy Asian food on this cold Friday evening.  I chose Ichiban based on online reviews such as this and the fact that their menu offered such oddities that other restaurants wouldn't dare to offer.  I figured, this place ought to be great if they can offer these on their menu!  Items such as intestine, tripe, and duck tongue just to name a few.  Besides, I'm sick of those ""Chinese buffet"" style food.  I craved originality and unique taste and flavor.  

I wanted everything on the menu!  However, just looking at the prices and what I have in my wallet , I figured it wasn't a good idea to order much so I decided to phone in my order of Hot and Spicy Beef and Hot and Sour Seafood soup.  The first attempt of calling was unsuccessful; I received a generic voicemail.  The second attempt fared better.  I was greeted by a noisy background and eventually a lady who seemed to be very polite.  In the midst of giving my order, she started yelling something in her native language.  Nonetheless, she repeated my small order back to me and asked me to come in 35 minutes to pick up my order due to it being very busy.  I hesitantly agreed.  35 minutes later passed by and I'm at the register watching the waiters and waitresses dart back and forth.  I kid you not, they are running back and forth carrying food.  Not just 1 or 2 staff members, ALL of them are running around!  Cups are being held with fingers inside of them so they're able to hold more while they run.  Bowls and plates of food are not served on a serving tray so they're just running back and forth from the kitchen to tables.  Aye aye aye!  This was a sight to be seen I tell ya!  They must have this down to an exact science as there were not a drop or spill anywhere during this circus fest!

The biggest kicker was that they never made my food yet.  I waited around for an additional 30 minutes for them to keep telling me it's being prepared.  30 minutes is not an estimate either, I timed it on my cell phone from arrival to seeing it placed on the takeout table as there were nowhere for me to sit while I waited.  Of course, one of the staff member invited me to sit next to another dining patron 20 minutes into my wait, however, I politely declined.  I wonder, If I phoned in my order previously and it took an hour to get to me, were they an hour behind on all food orders?  

Ahh, I finally have my food with me but with no included utensils or napkins. This is where I tell you that all this waiting was worth it.   Yep, you guessed it.  I would've gotten the same satisfaction with Wendy's spicy chicken nuggets.  The Hot and Spicy Beef were served cold in a pool of red chili garlic oil.  The $9 Hot and Sour seafood soup was just your measly Chinese buffet style hot and sour soup with 1, yes 1 baby shrimp and 4 squid and a 3 imitation crab leg piece.  This was an utter disappointment.  I ended up rinsing off the beef with water because it was soaked in oil and throwing half of the hot and sour soup away because there were no other edibles in it.  No tofu, no mushroom, nor bamboo shoots.  No pun intended but this entire experience left me with a hot and sour taste in my mouth.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone considering there are many other choices in the same vicinity.  Thank you all for reading and happy eating!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"GREAT Chinese food ，spicy，i like spicy food , spicy crisp chicken ,spicy string bean,\eggplant with spicy gralic sauce,thin wrap pork in sauce , sichuan style cucumber,its awesome，"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We ordered $40 worth of delivery last night; potstickers, shrimp fried rice, and the rabbit hot pot. 

Good: fast delivery (about 35 minutes) 

Bad: everything else. 
* the potsticker dough was oddly crunchy and the sauce was essentially soy sauce with oil and salt added to it (I know it sounds weird but thats exactly what it tasted like) 
* the fried rice had shrimp tails in it. Not attached to the shrimp itself - that I could understand - but the shrimp tails were removed from tiny, bland, and *NOT* deveined shrimp (gross!) and then, inexplicably, added to the fried rice. In their entirety. What? Why?!? 

But the worst part of the order was the rabbit hot pot. Firstly, it wasn't a hot pot, it was soggy vegetables with chopped dried red peppers and what can only be described as bony wads of meat. The entire dish was overly salted and lacked any sort of broth and the meat! Oh. EM. GEE! The meat! Imagine taking Korean BBQ short ribs, balling them up, adding an entire set of human teeth and then infusing it with lard and soy sauce and you've got the Ichiban Rabbit Hot Pot. Biting into what I thought was going to be the flesh of a tasty animal and hearing bones being pulverized by my molars was enough to give me chills. It was a bizzare  experience. Never again. 

In short, the best part of the meal was the steamed white rice."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My wife and I came here for lunch the other day and I must say that I really like this place.   The food rivals those in China Town  Chicago, such as Laos Schezuan.  They have both  lunch and dinner menu and we ordered from the dinner menu.  Our waiter was a man in his forties and was helpful with offering recommendations from the menu.   We ordered crispy chicken, ox tongue, and a spicy fish dish.  All were wonderful and spicy and we ended up with leftovers to take home.  Spicy is 7.5 out of 10."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,So yummy..went there twice and love it...intestines is my fav...chicken in oil appetizer is also delish...never had it before ever.  A great place in Madison...I hope they stay around.
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Ichiban is up there with the best Chinese in Madison. 

Most of the menu is authentic with a few American standards thrown in.  Think General Tso's chicken. 

It's best to come with a few adventurous friends and order several items. The portions are huge for the prices.  String beans with or without minced pork and cumin lamb are my faves.  

I will be back. Soon."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I have been to Ichiban more than 10 times since it first opened ~ 2 years ago. When I first heard of their name, I thought it's a Japanese restaurant. But make no mistake, Ichiban serves up authentic Sze Chuan food. Their menu and taste are actually pretty similar to Fugu, but since Ichiban opened I frequent Ichiban so much more because parking is so much easier right in front of the restaurant itself or along one of the streets nearby (free in the evenings and weekends!). 

I have tried (and recommend) their spicy fish dishes. There are a couple of those in the menu. Together with the hot pot series (kidneys, intestines, fish and lamb). The claypot beef is a good dish too, it has smooth and tender pieces of beef with a medley of mushrooms in a nice stew. If you feel like taking a break from the meat (why would you), their Japanese style tofu is a nice choice, with bits of seafood on a plate of gently fried tofu rounds. 

Traditional Sze Chuan dishes are generally hot, spicy and oily. I like the oily part the least, and often find myself using their generous portion of rice to soak up the oil instead. Even though the food portions are great, they can get pretty pricey. An appetizer plus two main dishes can easily add up to about 30 or more for a party of two. It's also an excellent idea to go in larger groups, so you can order and try out more dishes on your visit. It's afterall a Chinese style restaurant, so ordering a number of dishes to share around the table is common tradition."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Japanese name, but good Chinese food! I went here with a group of 6 on a Friday night and was seated right away. The first thing that struck me about the menu was the variety of ingredients and also the number of different ways they prepared pork intestine. Our curiosity was piqued so when we asked the waitress about the intestine she was very helpful and recommended the crispy style. We ordered the cumin beef, ma po tofu, lamb with ginger and scallions, pan fried fish, and spicy crispy pork intestine. All of them were very good and, with the exception of the lamb and fish, pretty spicy. A few of my friends needed tissues to deal with their spice-induced runny noses. Anyway, I came out stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey, but I was very satisfied."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. It definitely leans spicier, more vegetable heavy, and more traditional than any other such restaurant in Madison that I've tried. Almost everything I've had (dine in and take out) has been fantastic. Some dishes are a little more typical of americanized spots (such as the lo mein), but still beat the other places in town.

One issue is that the full menu is not completely pulled into most of the online ordering services, so there can be some surprises if you order off of say, GrubHub. For instance, my favorite dish there is San Bei (three cup) Chicken -- Ichiban's menu lets you know that it is chopped and bone-in, GrubHub does not -- it was a little surprising though delicious."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"We were wanting real Chinese and this rocks! Friendly staff and good service. Try the potato strings in hot sauce appetizer. The tomato and egg and Hong Kong style seafood soups were uniquely flavorful. Order a bit of each and share. As another reviewer said this and Fugu Asian are the real deal. We will be back.

BTW, if you aren't adventurous there are plenty of items on the menu that can work for you."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,Hands down the best in the Midwest. do yourself a flavor and try the chicken shrimp with walnuts.
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"So I came to Madison hoping against hope that there would be a Chinese restaurant I could at least stomach. (Coming from a Chinese family, after living in California and visiting Taiwan every year... you get the picture.)
 
Imagine my surprise when the first Chinese place I go to is GREAT! My mom and I were both impressed. We had a great time talking to the two male waiters, who are both from the same hometown in China as my mom. Be prepared for the food to be spicy, but if you like that- this is the place for you.

Here's what I have tried so far, and every single one I fully endorse:
-Sichuan Style Cucumber Appetizer
-Spicy Stir Fried Green Beans
-Twice Cooked Pork with Black Curded Bean and Pepper
-Chicken with Three Pepper
-Sliced Fish with Salted Mustard Cabbage (it's a soup, don't be surprised, but IT'S SO GOOD. really spicy though.)

But everything is worth a try! Packed on weekend nights (with Chinese!), but the place is big so no worries."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Having been using this place as a to-go restaurant since about 3 years ago. The food is okay, w/ most spicy stuff. However, the flavor is too much determined by the sauce they are using and almost all spicy dishes share the same sauce! Also, the menu has not been updated since DAY 1 they opened (was it in 2011???), gee!

Side note, the owner also has a same restaurant opened around Purdue University campus, which is the same taste with the same menu..."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,Had another great meal at Ichiban.  Arrived at 230 this afternoon -- still in time for the lunch specials which ends at about 3 o'clock. Ordered the Thai red curry with chicken served along with steamed rice. Service was excellent - no waiting and very pleasant waitress. Order came out promptly. The red curry was delicious. Always a good experience at this place.
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Great Sichuan. Try the fish in yellow pepper. Comes under a mound of dried red pepper, like many dishes here. The effect is as numbing as it is spicy. Many dishes can be oily, but that's where the flavor is."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"On our road trip back home from Chicago to Minneapolis, we decided to stop in Madison for lunch.  After indulging in all kinds of bar food while on vacation, I was craving a different cuisine; so Chinese was the final decision.

The service we received was great, we were seated right away and our food came quickly after we'd ordered it. The waitress was helpful in aiding us with our decisions on what to get. My boyfriend and I started with some Hot & Sour soup then shared the Kung Pao Chicken and the Red Curry Chicken. Both dishes came with side bowls of rice (more than enough definitely).  The portions are large, so if you don't have a huge appetite I'd recommend sharing one dish between two people. 

I'm giving this three stars because the Sichuan pepper spice was good and left my mouth feeling slightly numb, but the food was overall A-OK. Some of the pieces of chicken in the Kung Pao dish were a little chewy and fatty which grossed me out a bit. The Red Curry Chicken was better and I enjoyed the snap peas, zucchini, and mushrooms which were part of the dish. The hot & sour soup was a little thicker than I enjoy but it warmed me up and was still okay!

This restaurant is a little unique because the SIchuan spice is so different and not many places specialize in dishes that use it. But honestly, I would have enjoyed some unhealthy, greasy ""mall"" chinese food more."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My partner and I tried Ichiban Sichuan for dinner the other night. The food was outstanding!

When we arrived, it was pretty busy but there were a few tables available. The hostess was pretty engrossed with someone, but she eventually led us to a table and provided us with menus. It took awhile, but eventually a waitress came by to take our order. (They were quite busy and the waitresses seemed very busy.) We ordered the String Bean with Garlic Sauce, the Lamb with Cumin, and the Pan Fried Thick Rice Noodle with Pork. We were surprised that the String Bean appetizer was served cold. It was a little jarring at first, but after a few bites I was a fan. The garlic was almost creamy and buttery and every bite was delicious. The lamb with cumin had just a little spice but it grew over time and again the flavors and textures were amazing. I'm not a huge rice noodle fan but the pork and the sauce were delicious.

Beyond the incredible food, two things that stood out for me most. When I went to use the restroom it was not only immaculate, it smelled good. Some restrooms have an odor where you want to get in and out as quickly as possible, but this restroom was actually pleasant.

Also, we biked over. There is a dearth of places to lock your bike nearby. Having some bike racks close would be a great improvement."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Good food and service. Tried the dandan noodles, fried shredded beef in chili sauce, and spicy and crispy chicken. All had good heat without being over the top. Food came out very fast."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Very good, authentic Chinese food! The portions are large and easy to share with the whole family. My family doesn't like very spicy food, but if you ask, you can ask how spicy it is or to make it mild. Our family had the beef hibachi, fried rice, and steamed/stir fry vegetables. It was all very good! There are a lot of dishes to choose from. The service isn't the best-- not what you would suspect from a typical restaurant. Though, we got in, ordered food, and got it right away, so it's not much of a problem. Parking is an issue; we weren't sure where to park and parking in front of the restaurant is prohibited from 4-6 M-F. 

I would visit again!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Went to Ichiban last night with a pretty large group of people. They were very accommodating! The service was fantastic--the woman who took care of our table was very meticulous. 
We got several appetizers including ox tongue, spicy chicken, dumplings, and pan-fried scallion cakes. Everything was really good! The texture of the ox tongue was a little weird, but that could have been the individual piece. I tried a little bit of a few entrées including the hot pot, which was so good! I had the lo mein noodles with spicy minced pork. It was pretty disappointing, actually. The lo mein noodles were way too soft and the minced pork was actually ground pork. It was kind of like eating spaghetti with the noodles drowned in sauce. Not a fan. One thing that I thought was particularly good was the rice! It was very sticky and held flavor nicely. Definitely not regular take-out fare. All in all it was a hit-or-miss dinner with mostly hits. I'll definitely go back again."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I am so like it spicy food ,spicy crispy chicken.too many special food,if you like spicy food ,you will be come here try it .eggplant with chili garlic sauce .string bean ,"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I'll keep it short and maybe not so sweet... Not my favorite. 

The server/host whatever he was was kind or rude and the woman who brought our food from the kitchen didn't smile or say a word or respond when we thanked her.  No one checked up on us after we got our food and we had to get out of our chairs to go ask for our check

The food was sub par. The prices are high and I wasn't impressed.  I had sesame chicken and my friend had some sort of chicken that was basically tiny chunks of deep fried chicken that was kind of crunchy with no sauce,  gross. 

My chicken was ok... But it was a lot of breading and the sauce was too sweet. There are better options in Madison"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"My sister and I went there randomly one night and ordered braised chicken hot pot. Its my first time eating hot pot and I got to say I can make this at home and it would be better. I am no chef but I have Asian taste buds and this dish was a disappointment. It was basically boiled chicken in red pepper garlic oil, bean sprout and a whole lot of red pepper. It was just spicy... no other flavor was there and the chicken was not braised. 

The service was friendly and they tried to answer our questions but for the most part they neglected us. We had to ask for water refill twice (our mouths were on fire) and they never came to check in on us to see if we needed anything else. 

Although Ichiban is lacking in decor I got to say the feel of the place is pretty nice. I think they are still in the process of decorating so hopefully things will look better soon.

Overall it was fun eating out of a pot but for the most part dont try the braised chicken hot pot unless you like the burning sensation all over your mouth. However I am willing to give it another go. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong dish. Next time I'm going for the pig intestine hot pot and see how that one differs from the one I previously ate."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Since Orient House went downhill, I'm looking for a new delivery option. I won't pretend to have a sophisticated taste - I order General's chicken, chicken/mixed veggies, and spring rolls. 

Judging from the other reviews, Ichiban Sichuan has some great dishes, but my boring stuff isn't among them."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The ma la is real.  I was so pleased to find a Chinese menu that wasn't full of the standard Americanized fare, and the food delivered.  

I ordered the fried shredded beef in chili sauce and the cucumber with Chinese dipping sauce to cool things down.  The entree was well balanced with nice florals coming through from the peppercorn and plenty of aromatics.  I ordered it ""spicy"" which is one step down from the hottest and found it to be just right (I love spicy food, but I don't like it so spicy that I sweat.).   Again, the peppercorn came through but was not so heavy handed that I felt like I just went to the dentist.  

I am sad that this place isn't near my home, but I will certainly come back next time I'm in Madison."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Like another reviewer, I don't know why on earth I waited so long to come back, because it is awesome. I went here again for dinner last night with a large group of friends (9 people total). We ordered 7 dishes for everyone to share, and every last one of them was delicious (something I was honestly not expecting given the large number of choices) and tasted balanced - none of them was too spicy, greasy, sweet, or salty. The spicy dishes are spicy at a good level where you can taste the other ingredients and not just burning. I was particularly fond of the salt-and-pepper squid, the crispy and spicy chicken, and tofu in garlic sauce. The food seemed to come out really quickly, and service was great, even with our big group. This time I am not going to wait 9 months to come back :)"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Ichiban.. the name might be a little misleading if you did not do your research.  Its a Chinese not Japanese restaurant.

The food to me (not an expert)  seemed like authentic Sichuan. It has some nice spicy dishes. If you want you can push your pallete and comfort zone, try things like kidney and intestine. 

I went on a particularly cold day with two of my Asian friends, one of whom spoke Mandarin. So we got some hot water to start our meal-a nice touch for me. I know most Americans cringe at the idea of hot water to drink- but to my friends and me, it was pretty darn good. Next time I went in by myself, I also received it. If you ask you can get some hot water.

Now to the FOOD.. it was yummy. So far in my two visits I have had: an eggplant dish, kidney in garlic sauce, hot and crispy chicken, pork intestine, and green beans in garlic. I have liked it all. The kidney I would not have again- the taste was good but the texture was not my thing. The intestine I would do again. The other stuff were things I normally eat- so they were all something I would eat. 

Overall Ichiban is good."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Had the spicy, crispy chicken. It was good. I just have a couple of caveats. First, there was no sauce. The picture I saw suggested a sauce accompanying the dish. I still liked it , I just added sriacha. Secondly there are no veggies in the dish, just a mass amount of chili peppers. I don't mind spice, in fact I love it and I consumed all my chicken, I just didn't see the purpose of one pound of chili peppers. Picture to follow. I will go again because I liked my food and the service was decent. Looking forward to trying one of their hot pots."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I had read reviews about Ichiban and Fugu having both authentic Chinese cuisines in Madison.  I recently went to Fugu so I had to go to Ichiban.  

The staff allowed us to peruse the menu for a while before taking our order.  It's huge and many things sound yummy.  We spent some time trying to get a look of other's meals without being too obvious and rude. 

I decided to order 3 ingredient potstickers for all of us.  I love hot and sour soup so I ordered their sour and spicy seafood soup for myself, or so I thought.  They brought out a huge bowl of soup and three cups for everyone.  Thankfully, the others were willing to eat it.  I even ended up taking soup home.  The soup had a wonderful flavor and perfect heat.  The seafood was fake crab, canned shrimp and possibly octopus.  I didn't eat the krab or shrimp but the octopus was good.  The potstickers were great with a tasty soy sauce.

For entrees, one person got the mei fun which she loved and are it all up.  I got the shrimp in black bean sauce.  I wanted to go outside my comfort zone but I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with a safe bet.  The other person ordered poached chicken hot chili sauce.  The waitress accidentally wrote sliced fish.  It was still amazing.  He'll try the chicken next time but it was still amazing.

Overall, the food was great and fast.  I hate to say but I like Fugu a tiny bit more.  Thus, the 4 star."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Amazing new chinese resturant in madison. Most importantly, its style is spicy szechuan which I love.My fav szechaun resturant in china town chicago is Lao Sze Chaun, which is by far the best chinese food place I have ever been to. I must say Ichiban is comparable to that. Food is awwsome,very spicy but in a great way. Service is a bit spotty, but they more than made up with the food. I will definitely go there again."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Get the string beans with garlic sauce.  I know, I know, how good can they be?  They're just freaking beans, right?  Get them.

The food is noticeably and consistently fresher and more flavorful than the other Asian delivery I've had so far in Madison.  Without digging around I can actually see vegetables and huge pieces of tender chicken in my Pad Thai. Yum."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I was a little skeptical as I drove up to Ichiban Sichuan because when I looked into the window I didn't see anyone inside. As I walked into the restaurant (because I trust Yelper's reviews), the other half of the restaurant was packed. 

We were promptly seated and given glasses of water along with a set of menus. After going over the vast menu, we decided on a mapo tofu, spicy dried intestines, and spicy fish hotpot with mushrooms. 

All three dishes were out on the table within 10 minutes. I've never been to a restaurant where the food is served piping hot in a matter of minutes. All three dishes were delicious. The food wasn't too spicy, but it had a great flavor. The mapo tofu was served piping hot with tons of meat and spicy sauce. The fish hot pot was not too spicy but had a nice kick to it. There was plenty of fish along with a good portion of enoki mushrooms and bean sprouts. The dried intestines was a little disappointing. The flavor was good, but it wasn't as crispy as I expected. Overall the flavor of the food was excellent, but on the greasy side. So, if you don't have a iron stomach, you might want to only get one spicy dish. 

I definitely will be back one more time before I leave Madison. Thanks again Ichiban Sichuan for the delicious meal!!!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Going to be a short review, as I just tried their delivery service on Sunday. But it's a happy one, too!

Was very impressed with their delivery. It came about 30-40 min after I ordered, which was about the amount of time they said it would take so I was prepared. It also arrived very hot which is a definite plus. 

I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and Potstickers. Both were delish! The chicken was in fairly large pieces, which I enjoyed because it made me feel like I was actually eating chicken. Too many times have I gotten those tiny pieces of fried something-or-other at other Chinese restaurants. Not here! There was also just the right amount of breading and sauce on the chicken. It was sweet and spicy but not too much of either. The broccoli was also cooked perfectly. Not soggy at all. Potstickers were very good. I like when they have a little bit of crunch to them on the ends, which these did. The dipping sauce was also yummy. I finished them in about 5 minutes. 

Besides eating the Potstickers all at once, the chicken entree is definitely enough food for 2 meals. You also get a side of white rice with your entree. Next time I order from here I will definitely attempt to be a bit more adventurous as some of the things recommended on here sound awesome!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"At Bob S' behest, I finally got around to ordering from Ichiban.

First, I would just like to say this was the fastest delivery order yet. We placed our order at ~7:30, and received a call at 7:50. I was expecting an hour's wait, as is typical for delivery in Madison, and was pleasantly surprised. 

Second, this place has real, yes REAL, scallion pancakes (though it could have been crunchier). Ever since moving here from Boston, I have been on a crusade to find scallion pancakes. I've tried dozens of Chinese places, and have received bread with scallions, fried crepes with scallions, but never actual scallion pancakes... Until now.

Now, moving on to the actual food, which is among the most authentic Szechuan cuisine (along with Fugu) in all of Madison. 

We ordered the ox tongue and triple with chili sauce (different cuts of beef doused in chili oil), scallion pancakes (yay finally), eggplant with chili garlic sauce (huge chunks of sweet eggplants immersed in chili sauce) and poached sliced fish in hot chili sauce (the most tender fish you will ever have).

The meal also came with 2 boxes of white rice, perfect for soaking up all the chili sauce. 

Though, for some reason, there were no fortune cookies. C'mon Ichiban, you need to get with the game here.

That being said, everything was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be stuffing my face with their dishes sometime soon. 

One thing of note is that the prices are slightly higher than most Chinese places in Madison, but I'd say it's well worth it."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"The driver said we were 22 miles from them thats why it took 2 hours for delivery. However, we are 17 min 7.8 miles from door to door..Cashew chicken was garlic flavored, chicken tasted not fresh. Appetizer vegetable dumpling is bland filled with what tasted like greens of some sort? no taste. The order did not come with any sauces such as soy. Chicken and Shrimp TSO is ok, large chunks. Mongolian beef was fair. Smoothies were all good, but order was all mixed up.  We ordered online. No one calls u to confirm or informs u of any delays. It was snowing but not a blizzard."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,one of the best Chinese food in Madison area! The spicy dishes are great and truly  spicy!
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Very authentic sichuan food. I got the mapo tofu, white chicken in chili oil, and spicy pork kidney. They could considering lowering their prices a bit, but the portions are substantial and the food is deliciousl"
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"When it's late on a Monday night and you don't want to venture out onto the snowy roads, there is always takeout and Ichiban was our pick.
I went with the spicy and crispy chicken and my girlfriend opted for the wonton soup.
The s/c chicken was interesting.  It doesn't come with a sauce (basically popcorn chicken bites) but the seasoning and breading was excellent.  You can't miss the floral heat from the sichuan peppercorns and the amount of hot pepper that was left was impressive.  The spiciness was not overbearing but definitely had a zip.
The soup was also solid.  The broth was well made and flavorful and the wontons did not suffer from the gumminess that is often the case.
Definitely think I need to return and try other dishes.  Fair warning: the menu is humongous so it may be a little tough at first to decide what to go for."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,A really great spot. Real Chinese food. Very broad menu including very authentic cuisine. We go here a few times a month. Casual and kid friendly. Great service. Try the spicy chicken and we love the garlic pork.
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"I came here with a party of 9.  Don't be fooled by the Japanese name.  It is actually Chinese Sichuan cuisine.  Every dish is either spicy or super spicy!!

I actually did my research prior walking in the restaurant just to see what I should order.  We did our dan dan noodles, ma po tofu, salt and spicy chicken, pot stickers, and many more dishes.  I really enjoyed the ma po tofu mixed with the dan dan noodles.  Perfect spiciness.

The appetizers were tasty.  If you cannot eat spicy, you should ask your waiter and see what they recommend.  They do have a lot of variety and I believe I took pictures on the entire menu for your viewing.  Overall a solid 3 stars.  We didn't have to wait TOO long, we had a whole room to ourselves pretty much (the place is pretty big as you walk inside).  Never mind the decor, you're eating at a Chinese restaurant.

I wouldn't recommend the Mango smoothie although we ordered 5.  Too sweet and syrupy- doubt it had too much real mango in there.

They charge $1.50 for a cup of tea.  Kind of ridiculous if you ask me since I usually get it for free.  We ordered at least 10 plates of food and bill was around $250 + tip.  Not too bad for so many of us.  However, the waiter did forget to input A LOT of things we ordered into the system.  Good thing we were already full and ended up canceling those orders anyway."
Ichiban Sichuan,chicken with spicy and sour garlic sauce,"Great Asian food. Never thought I'd find anything comparable to Chinatown restaurants outside of Chicago. The menu is very expansive. Portions are huge (ordered an app and a dish and ate them for a few meals). The pickled pepper dishes will leave you craving forever. Not to mention, I ordered my dish ""extra spicy"" and lo and behold -- they made it spicy! Yum. Ordered out so no ratings on the restaurant itself."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I've only had the food from here once and it was delivery.  I like how delivery is online, that is great for me.  The green beans with garlic that I heard so much about was good but they were ice cold (on purpose).  I didn't dig that so much.  The flavor was good though, a little greasy but good.  The general tso's chicken was super good and I felt good after eating it.  It's okay.  I would consider eating there again in house since I hear so many good things about it."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I'm baffled by the good reviews on here.  First, this is not a Japanese restaurant if the name suggested otherwise.  It really shouldn't even be considered a Chinese restaurant as the food does injustice to what is actually good Sze Chuan / Chinese food.  

Second, I'm not the best cook in the world, but I feel like I can stir fry green beans and sizzling beef (or ""hibachi beef"" as they call it) much better than this place.  The food was way too salty and tasted worse than the Chang Jiang Americanized stuff, especially given the not-so-cheap prices ($15 for the hibachi blob, $10 for the green beans). 

Third, tea is charged per cup ($1.75) with free refills.  Since it was per cup anyways, I asked to have a different tea from my co-diner, but the server was basically too lazy to brew two different kettles, so she told us that they only had one type of tea.  Sure.  They really should just charge per kettle, like almost every other Chinese restaurant in the country.

I really wanted to support Asian restaurants in Madison out of the hope that more will spring up, but this is just plain bad.

If you want to try what is actually good Sze Chuan food, please do yourself a favor and drive to Chinatown in Chicago and go to Lao Sze Chuan.  Then come back and revise your review for this place."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Amazing authentic Sichuan Chinese food!! Don't come here if you're expecting your typical Americanized Chinese food, because they specialize in the typically spicy Sichuan cooking.

My personal favorites include the dry braised chicken with spicy sauce in hot pot (under gan guo), the spicy shredded potato, ox tongue (be adventurous! it's so good), and twice cooked pork.

Seriously the best REAL Chinese food I've had in Madison. A real local treasure."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Stopped in while passing through Madison. Definitely not your ordinary food court Chinese food. The menu is much more authentic and has an overwhelming amount of options. It reminds me of Hong Kong Noodle, one of my favorite Chinese restaurants back in Minneapolis. All of the dishes looked and smelled salty and delicious, just what I was craving. 

My girlfriend and I were able to order off the lunch specials menu which featured many popular items from the menu at a very decent price. We split an order of Kung Pao Chicken, and also an order of Red Curry Chicken. The dishes came out fast and looked mouthwatering. The Kung Pao Chicken had a lot of flavor and included peanuts (one of my favorite parts) and some sort of chile but no other vegetables. The chicken seemed poor quality. It felt a little mushy and slightly slimy. I don't think it tasted as good as it looked, I got a little sick of that dish by the end. The red curry chicken was not fried and the the chicken looked and tasted of much better quality. The curry came with the chicken along with an assortment of vegetables all covered in the red curry sauce. The curry tasted good but lacked enough flavor, I thought the dish could have been a little more powerful. Those are my favorite curries. It was a good cheap lunch if you're looking for some Chinese in the area."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"We ordered delivery from Ichiban the other day. 
We got:
Green bean appetizer. Very good. 
Dumplings: BAD. Badbadbad. I'm positive they were a brand of frozen dumplings I used to buy at Woodman's. 
Spring rolls: Soft and not flavorful. I'm willing to bet these were also frozen. 
Rice: I thought the rice was good. Sticky and thick grains. Not typical of the asian delivery I'm used to. 
Cashew Chicken: Bland. My boyfriend didn't like it and I ended up eating most of it because my dish was almost inedible. 
San Bei Chicken: Decent flavor but nothing to rave about. I googled this dish before ordering and the ingredients sounded delicious. I found chunks of ginger and garlic in my dish and that's great. I wasn't prepared for bone shards and slivers. I know San Bei chicken is made by chopping chicken bits up and cooking them with spices/sauce so I was prepared for full on bone chunks but NOT for slivers. Actual slivers and splinters of bone wrapped up in chicken made eating this dish impossible and dangerous. I spent 20 minutes picking the bones out of my food and ended up with a bowl full of rice and sauce. I was very upset by this. 

We ended up throwing the food away because there just wasn't a point to eating it anymore.  I would have had the rest of the chicken for breakfast, but biting down on bone bits isn't appetizing. 

I am especially disappointed because of all the raving reviews on Yelp and Grubhub. This food wasn't good and we wont be ordering from or eating here again."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"If you love spicy food, this is the place to go. They have legitimate Sichuan Chinese food that my family and I love. They can make any dish spicy and still taste unique and delicious. The prices are also reasonable, and the serving sizes are quite generous as well. One of the better Chinese restaurants in town."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"THE BEST Chinese food in Madison, hands down.

What I love about this place:
- authentic (many dishes which are difficult to find elsewhere)
- delicious! The meats are always unbelievably tender and the the food so flavorful (esp if you like spicy- which is what Szechuan cuisine is known for)
- can easily accomodate large parties 

Go there! Now!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"The name is confusing but it's a Sze Chuan Chinese restaurant, meaning its best dishes are really spicy.

I'd say the food is comparable to Fugu. To be honest (and don't kill me!), I don't notice a huge difference.

BUT, I will say that Ichiban does a MUCH better boiled beef dish than Fugu. A seasoned Sze Chuan chef drops dead every time Fugu makes that dish. Kidding. Kind of. Ichiban's version tops Fugu's bastardized one every damn time.

So if you like boiled beef (and if you haven't tried it, go for it! Its Chinese name literally translates to ""water-boiled beef"" though that is SO misleading because it's jam-packed with spicy chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Be sure to drink some milk afterwards), go to Ichiban. Go out of your way to go to Ichiban. Other than that, if you have to choose between Fugu and Ichiban, go with whichever one is closer."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"We went to Ichiban's for lunch. For appetizers my wife and I ordered spring rolls. They were hot and crisp, but bland. For my entree I ordered twice cooked pork and my wife had crispy spicy chicken. My pork was a very solid entree. Nice ginger undertones to a spicy mix of veggies and thinly sliced pork. The sauce was a little thin in flavor, but the pepper flakes have a nice kick. My wife's chicken was inundated with hot peppers. The chicken was good, but could have been better with a sauce. Overall a very solid meal."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I have been frequenting Ichiban for over a year at least once a month. The staff is always friendly. They have updated the dining area to be more comfortable and the menu to be more user-friendly. This food is authentic. That means it doesn't taste like Chang Jiang! Regarding authentic Chinese food, it costs a great deal more to make then your typical Americanized Chinese food. However, these prices are very reasonable. The portions are always adequate and the service is fast, especially at lunch!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,Awesome spicy beef noodle soup! Sichuan food is one of my favorite kind of authentic Chinese food
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Having visited on two occasions, I definitely recommend this place for some yummy Sichuan cuisine.

For those first time visitors, have confidence as you go in. I'm not sure what is typical but I just grabbed some menus and sat my party down at a table of my choice. If no one directs you as you walk in, just do it yourself.

FYI, look for the slightly numbing/tingling feeling the spicy dishes do to your mouth. This is the famous sichuan pepper and provides a unique and (I think) a pleasurable experience, much more complexity than just being a 'hot' addition.

The dishes I've tried are as follows (additional comments are further on):
-ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce
-sichuan dan dan noodles
-ma po tofu
-eggplant with chili garlic sauce
-homestyle twice cooked pork
-seafood soup
-raspberry smoothie with bubbles (tapioca pearls - a nice chewy surprise)

I look forward to visiting again and giving a go to my first Hotpot experience. If your coming here, don't order sesame chicken or general tso. From what I've know, that's not Chinese food. Get the real stuff and expand your horizons. If you need a suggestion to get you going, order the twice cooked pork. That is a very popular choice. 

Also, 1 dish per person (and share!!!) is plenty but and extra one or two is fun for diversity (you can bring home the extra!)


Here is other info:
ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce: if you haven't had tongue you could be in for a treat. Tongue is a common food in many cultures. When prepared right it is very tender and tasty.

sichuan dan dan noodles: a very nice spicy noodle dish. I really enjoyed it though having a noodle dish as an appetizer is different for me... it seems too filling so feel free to try it as a entree, it is large enough

ma po tofu: a spicy and slightly thickened chili sauce with pork (optional) and tofu. goes excellently with rice

eggplant with chili garlic sauce: the eggplant has a nice sweetness to it. quite good

homestyle twice cooked pork: Delicious! So tender and bursting with flavor. The 'homestyle' version includes little buns to eat with the meat. I would definitely recommend the twice cooked pork though I would not say it is necessary get the buns.

seafood soup: this was alright... not quite my favorite."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Protip: Do not wear a white shirt when you go to eat here. Cause it's chili peppers and hot sauce galore and you will get some on your shirt.

I love coming here for their lunch specials. $7.50 for about 30 different items. 

I have had the L17 which is Noodle w/ spare ribs and chili sauce. It is served as a soup dish even though it doesn't list as a soup. Every bite you take your mouth will be coated in chili flakes. If that's your thing awesome, I guess it's sorta my thing. I love the spiciness, maybe not the constant choking though. The L14 Noodle with Hot special beef. It is very similiar, noodles in soup, some veggies, and cilantro (love the cilantro touch!). I think I prefer this dish because the cuts of beef seem a little bigger and more satisfying. The other dish with the spare ribs can be a little cumbersome.

The twice cooked pork is basically bacon. Lots and lots of bacon in chili sauce. I love bacon. But I felt guilty eating this much bacon. 

The sichaun style cucumber is a refreshing appetizer. Cool and crunchy but spicy snack.

I've enjoyed most items here but the two dishes that I've gotten that I would probably pass on next time would be the walnut shrimp. This dish is a bout 15 or 16 dollars and was medicore. The broccoli was simply steamed with no spices and the shrimp is coated in like sweet and sour chicken batter but there were only a few pieces. The scallion pancakes appetizer wasn't particularly amazing, I've had better.

I hope to go there one day with about 2 other people to do their hot pot! It should be a lot of fun I think. And they allow you to split the pot into two broths. One spicy and one regular."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Ichiban is an excellent restaurant. The diners are almost all Chinese. I want to try everything but get timid when it comes time to order. The menu is huge and I cannot really tell what the dish is like before it arrives. The waitstaff speaks limited English and are unable to really help you out.

 I have been to Ichiban 3 times and each time I have enjoyed my meal. The food can be very oily but that is the case at Fugu as well, another authentic Chinese restaurant. Vegetables are fresh and crispy, tofu light and puffy and the sauces are diverse rather than everything tasting the same. My guy ordered the Cumin Flavored beef with Chili Sauce which was our least favorite dish. I have enjoyed the Sichuan sauce twice, once with chicken and once with tofu. I loved the Japanese Tofu in Hot Pot, Braised Vegetable with Shitake Mushroom and the Vegetable Dumplings. 

You must give Ichiban a try. i have never waited more than 10 minutes for my food to arrive.  I am hellbent on spending an evening there just interviewing folks about what they are eating.  I love moo-shu pork but this is a whole different ballgame."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"This place is great! I had a take out order of Kung Pao Chicken Chinese style extra hot. They were able to crank it out in about 5 minutes!  They gave large portions that made for easily two meals, I would definitely recommend at least giving it a shot."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"The food from ichiban was fantastic, save for the veggie dumplings, which where pretty much cold, two of the six were stale and rock hard on the edges and the dipping sauce was nothing like a dumpling sauce but like a vinegar/soy mix (bleh!)... BUT that was the only bad part of our meal!  Despite that they were out of spinach and my GF had to order something different (this was for delivery), the tofu and black mushrooms was excellant and flavorful.   The Tofu and Greens Soup was tasty as well, but I think its not 100% vegetarian, as the broth seemed more like a meat broth?  Im not positive because I did not ask.  I may the next time.  The Orange Chicken was AWESOME!  Perhaps the best I have had in town.  I believe this is what actual orange chicken may be like in Asia, with the orange rinds, garlic chunks, red chilis, and such that it was not super sweet like the pan-asian/Americanized dish that everyone is more familiar with. This was an excellant flavor experience!  Delivery was FAST!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I recently moved to Madison from Atlanta and was craving good Chinese food. This place really hit the spot. 
Madison doesn't have a dedicated neighborhood known for Asian food (i.e Chinatown), so I wasn't sure where to look. I'm so relieved to have found this gem. It's authentic, spicy, Szechuan style food. While they do deliver, I definitely wouldn't put this place in the same category as a typical Chinese-American delivery/fast food place.  The steamed fish is especially good. If you don't enjoy spicy foods though, you probably won't enjoy this place. 
I would recommend getting one dish per person and sharing family style (having your own rice bowl and sharing the other plates). I usually get three dishes for two people so I can have leftovers."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"For once, a recommendation for a Chinese restaurant in Madison came through for me.  The food at Ichiban is not the best Chinese that I've ever had, but it's certainly at a different level from what you might find in Madison.  

We went and had a vermicelli with minced pork, eggplant with garlic sauce, and the spicy chicken dish.  The spicy chicken dish was very good if you like some heat in your food.  I found the eggplant with garlic sauce somewhat oily, but it went well with some rice.

This place is the best Chinese I've had in Madison.  It's rather pricey, but it's not your typical Chinese takeout food and it's worth it.  Come here if you want to expand your culinary experience of Chinese food to more than just General Tso' chicken and orange chicken and be prepared to enjoy some spice."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Sichuan is a region in China known for hot babes. If you know a thing or two about what brings the heat you know that you need the whole package. Pretty and smart gets it done. Taking one without the other you're either shallow or a chump.

You'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere. These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden. Who likes that place? (I do. Kind of a lot. I think?). You'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or pickled soup. I am a big fan, and their spicy crispy chicken is my jam. The only thing I got here that I didn't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it didn't pack much heat and the sauce was thick and sweet. I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.

So what kind of babe is Ichiban? Obviously she's the brainy one that doesn't care what you think. I kinda wish she did, though."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"*Review for takeout only*

3.5 stars but there is no ""half"" option on Yelp. My friends have ordered here a couple of times. I would say that that the food is definitely Szechuan stile and full of spices and chili peppers, which I love. 

Things that we have tried are: fried oxtail, ox tongue, lo mein and another type of noodle, szechaun beef, kung pao chicken, and Szechuan beef. The first time we ordered, the food took a very very long time to come, but the second time was more reasonable (maybe 45 minutes or so?). I do appreciate that they do delivery though, so not a huge deal. My friend is an adventurous eater and recommended the oxtail and tongue and they were actually very well done. Very tasty.

Everything is deliciously spicy but very very oily, so keep that in mind; you will definitely not feel great afterwards. I would say that the more Szechuan dishes were all delicious and probably a 5/5 stars. The more ""Americanized"" dishes (such as lo mein, chicken, etc.) were mediocre at best, so this is not the place to go if this is the type of Chinese food you're looking for. 

I think really, for me, the reason why it is only around 3.5 stars is because the portions are very small for the prices (for $15 an entrée, about half of the entrée was just chili peppers for several of them each time). Things may be different in the restaurant perhaps, so don't let my review stop you from trying it out if you like big, bold spices!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"3.5 stars. Don't be fooled by the Japanese name...this place is a Chinese restaurant! It just so happens to be THE best Chinese food in Madison. This is a Sichuan style place, so make sure you stick to Sichuan dishes and you will be very happy. The service is so-so, but that's typical for a Chinese restaurant. This place doesn't get 5 stars because 1) It's way overpriced for Chinese food. $10-15/plate?! Are you kidding me? 2) The food is good, but not good enough to compare to decent Chinese food in other cities (ie Chicago, SF). 

FYI, Fugu used to be really good, but the chef moved to Ichiban a while ago."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Hate to do this, but I should probably report on my subpar Kung Pao chicken lunch special.  It was supposed to be spicy, but it had big chunks of peppers, which made it hard to eat.  Also, there was some strong ginger and one other ingredient that I really didn't like.  But worst of all, it was just really low quality, fatty chicken.  I threw two thirds of it out."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"The food is my favorite Chinese in Madison. I always seem to find something new to order that never fails to impress. The food is great and one order always amounts to a full second meal. That said, definitely get take out or delivery. We dined in once and that was enough. Interior is really uncomfortable, has an odd layout, and is unattractive. There always seem to be lots of staff moving about the place but not really paying that much attention to customers."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Our experience at Ichiban Sichuan on a Friday evening (early-ish), was...in a word...annoying. 

The service is the main reason this place is just two stars for me. The food would get three or four stars.

The decor of this place is a bit tacky, and it was pretty cold inside - I don't think it was well insulated. Several of the people that were eating there kept on their coats. Also, the music they were playing when we first came in included a slow-piano and violin version of the Happy Birthday song and other weird versions of cheesy songs. Not the coolest.
 
Our waitress was very nice and clearly wanted to please us, but unfortunately it didn't turn out right. First, she started us off with two glasses of water - one of which had a lipstick print on the side and clearly had not been washed. It made me wonder about the attentiveness to cleanliness there. She apologized and replaced the water glass quickly, however.

Then, having recently gone on a diet, I asked whether or not it was possible to get Kung Pao chicken NOT-fried.  She said yes, of course, nodding her head vigorously.  When the dish came (in pretty good time, I guess), the chicken was indeed fried.

My BF and I had ordered both the Kung Pao Chicken dish and the spicy green beans dish to share, which we made clear to the waitress. But the spicy green beans came out about 40 minutes afterwards. I was afraid we wouldn't even have time to eat it. While we were waiting for that dish, we had asked our waitress to check on it twice, which she said she did and that they were working on it in the kitchen.

And this is probably the most picky comment, but several of the waitresses (younger ones, ours included) were literally running around the place when a larger crowd came. They looked extremely stressed out.  I'm not sure if there was some unique situation happening behind the scenes, or if they had just hired a bunch of new wait staff, but it stressed me out seeing them so stressed out.

Anyway, I might get delivery from them in the future, but the in-person experience left a lot to be desired."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I used to go to Fugu in Gilman St. for dinner. I was excited when Ichiban was opened. The first couple of times, this restaurant was OK. 
The last two times, the food is not acceptable for the price. The salt and pepper octopus was not fresh and smelly and the chicken was very soft and did not taste like chicken at all. Last weekend my in-law came from out of town and my whole family went to Ichiban for dinner. My in-law ordered Lobster with ginger and scallion. It was a BIG MISTAKE. The lobster must have been frozen for months and the meat tasted awful and rotten. I confronted the owner and she admitted the lobster was not fresh. How can a restaurant serve the customer with rotten food!? I realize now the restaurant tries to cover up the inferior quality of the meat with heavy use of salt and hot pepper. But it would not work with customer with taste. It was a bad experience. I will never ever go back again!!!!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"This place was a saving grace for me. Being from out of town and being used to a plethora of Asian cuisine being everywhere, I  couldn't believe how there were so few authentic Chinese places. It's like there is a drought of authentic Chinese cuisine and thankfully this was the ONLY watering hole. Their string bean with garlic dish is always a go to dish along with the ox tongue and tripe. The double cooked pork was great. The spicy crispy chicken and beef brisket hot pot was definitely a favorite with the chicken just being spicy enough and succulent. And last but not least, the spicy crispy fish as well. I really hope this place thrives so if I ever have to come back, this will be my go to place to feel at home."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I ordered the Spicy Crispy Shrimp and the Kung Pao Chicken. The crispy shrimp was not to my liking. The sauce was extremely oily and greasy and I tasted cinnamon which I did not care for at all. The kung pao was only ok and also very oily. There was something off about the taste. What a waste of $30.

Not only was the food terrible but my delivery driver had some nerve to text me a picture of the receipt after claiming I didn't tip him well enough. The funny part was that it was an honest mistake. I realized later that some of the money blew off the table to the ground when I opened the door but I didn't realize it until after I got the very RUDE text from the driver. I work in the service industry and it certainly sucks to not get tipped properly but I would NEVER be so rude as to send a text to the customer. Ichiban has permanently lost a customer and i'm disgusted."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"By far the best Chinese place in Madison. (Don't let the name fool you). 

Trust me, the best way to experience Ichiban is to go with a big group and order several dishes and eat family-style. This is usually NOT my preferred way to go, because I don't eat red meat or pork and don't want to limit others' choices. But my Chinese-American friend who I've gone with twice suggested this for the real experience, and it didn't disappoint. The great thing is that there are so many fantastic veggie options, there was more than enough for this to work out both times we've done this with large groups.

Best dishes I've had:
Pan Seared Pea Sprouts
Kung Pao Chicken
Singapore Mei Fun
Fish in Hot Chili Sauce
Sauteed Udon (with tofu) -- the udon noodles are made in-house, mmm
Spicy String bean (my fave, so crazy good)
Ma Po Tofu (there is one with and without pork)
Sichuan Eggplant

The service is super fast and last time I went with a gluten free friend, and the waitress was very knowledgeable and careful to tell her what did and did not have gluten. Like I said I think the way to go is eat-in, family style, although my good friends order take out from here all the time. Since there is very little in the way of good Chinese take out in Madison, it's a great option."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Because this place had a 4 star rating we decided to try it for dinner.  We ordered chicken feet as appetizers, dry sauteed green beans, kung pao chicken and a seafood dish.

The worst dinner EVER!.  The chicken feet were pickled, rubbery and not spicy at all.
The other dishes were so salt laden my wife spat hers out and I gagged on my first bite. The kung pao sauce, aside from being way too salty, had no other flavour and was watery.

We complained to the manager who said there must have been ""a little too much salt"". Try there must have been half a container used for it to be this over-salted.

I don;t know if they were trying to give us the heave ho but as there was only one table there and they were friends of the manager I am assuming they were not inclined to new customers.

Don't bother trying this place, nothing authentic here."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,The Kung Pao and the eggplant were both spicy and tasty if a little oily.  I looked around and noticed no overweight lunchers despite that.  The lunch portions were smaller and correspondingly cheaper.  The space was quiet and pleasant.
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Always count on Ichiban when we crave authentic Chinese!!! Everything we eat here is good. Wendy, the owner is the best!!! Love Ox Tongue appetizer,    Beef with spicy capsicum and spicy crispy fish!!!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"We stooped for our first time for an early dinner.  The menu was huge and filled with a variety of items that caught our attention for the good and for the bad (ie everything with intestine).

We were less than daring and ordered three items.  

We tried to order pan fried dumplings but the waiter redirected us to the pot stickers.  Good advice.   They were perfect.  We then asked for entree recommendations.  The first was a beautiful looking and quite tasty beef ginger and scallion plate.  The second dish of chicken and basil was quite tasty but the chicken pieces were splintered with bones and difficult if not dangerous to eat!  

Overall the taste and quality of it all was very good and we will go back.  We will not order anything from the chicken portion of the menu."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"3 star is being nice.  I was here last month with colleagues from the office.  We ordered quite a variety to share.  The Mao pao tofu was delicious that day!  Couldn't wait to come back to have it again. 

Back today with the family for lunch...boy were we disappointed.  Ou Mao pao tofu had so much food enhancer my hubby and I could feel our lips tingling.  Not a good feeling.  Out beef lomein was greasy(especially since I asked for less oil).  The Chinese vegetable dish with fresh garlic was blah...lack favor & salt.  Where can we go for good healthy flavorful Chinese food????"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"My wife and I stopped in for lunch, read the great reviews on Yelp and since we were in the neighborhood thought we would give it a try. We ordered Fried rice, Orange Shrimp and General Tso's chicken. The Orange shrimp was fantastic, large shrimp and the sauce was just spicy right. Friend rice and General Tso's chicken also had great flavor and the portions are large. 

As others have mentioned the prices are high. Our lunch with tip was $43.00!! $1.75 for a cup of Tea??!! 

Overall, the food is great, the atmosphere nice and the service average."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Visited for lunch with a few coworkers.  Ordered the General T'so Chicken off of the $7.50 lunch menu (11-3, M-F) and it was fantastic!  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The sauce was complex and I could see & taste the peppers, garlic and ginger.  My coworkers ordered the Black Bean Sauce with Pork and the Sichuan Sauce with Chicken and both tasted great.  The veggies in their dishes were fresh and crisp.

Waitstaff was friendly and attentive, filling my water when needed.  I will be returning, hopefully often."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"The Chinese food there is authentic to me a native Chinese, however there are some downside that just balance the good part out. 

1. The service is bad. Water didn't get refilled. The rice came long after the entree. 
2. I find the chicken pork there are in normal quality, but not the beef! I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup on the other day. The beef cubes were very hard to chew, seem to come from the bone junctions or who-knows-where parts of a cow (hoofs or intestines?). It tasted like the elastic band. I could even see the white artery tubes sticking out of the meat. Yak."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"This place definitely satisfied my chinese sichuan food cravings. Why it starts with a japanese phase...i'm not sure but it could be considered number one for madison chinese food. We came with a party of 12 and it was easy to make a reservation as well as order a ton of food to try. We did family style and ordered; poached fish, crispy chicken, won tons, eggplant in garlic sauce, green beans, rice, broiled pork belly, tripe, salt and pepper shrimp, and kung pao chicken. i honestly probably forgot some items since we ordered so much, but it was great! We all helped ourself to the food and it came out in succession and fed us all to a good level. I highly recommend the eggplant as it is one of my favorite dishes of all time. 

Happy Eating!!!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"This was my 1st time in Madison and for some odd reason I felt a tingling need to satisfy my urge for spicy Asian food on this cold Friday evening.  I chose Ichiban based on online reviews such as this and the fact that their menu offered such oddities that other restaurants wouldn't dare to offer.  I figured, this place ought to be great if they can offer these on their menu!  Items such as intestine, tripe, and duck tongue just to name a few.  Besides, I'm sick of those ""Chinese buffet"" style food.  I craved originality and unique taste and flavor.  

I wanted everything on the menu!  However, just looking at the prices and what I have in my wallet , I figured it wasn't a good idea to order much so I decided to phone in my order of Hot and Spicy Beef and Hot and Sour Seafood soup.  The first attempt of calling was unsuccessful; I received a generic voicemail.  The second attempt fared better.  I was greeted by a noisy background and eventually a lady who seemed to be very polite.  In the midst of giving my order, she started yelling something in her native language.  Nonetheless, she repeated my small order back to me and asked me to come in 35 minutes to pick up my order due to it being very busy.  I hesitantly agreed.  35 minutes later passed by and I'm at the register watching the waiters and waitresses dart back and forth.  I kid you not, they are running back and forth carrying food.  Not just 1 or 2 staff members, ALL of them are running around!  Cups are being held with fingers inside of them so they're able to hold more while they run.  Bowls and plates of food are not served on a serving tray so they're just running back and forth from the kitchen to tables.  Aye aye aye!  This was a sight to be seen I tell ya!  They must have this down to an exact science as there were not a drop or spill anywhere during this circus fest!

The biggest kicker was that they never made my food yet.  I waited around for an additional 30 minutes for them to keep telling me it's being prepared.  30 minutes is not an estimate either, I timed it on my cell phone from arrival to seeing it placed on the takeout table as there were nowhere for me to sit while I waited.  Of course, one of the staff member invited me to sit next to another dining patron 20 minutes into my wait, however, I politely declined.  I wonder, If I phoned in my order previously and it took an hour to get to me, were they an hour behind on all food orders?  

Ahh, I finally have my food with me but with no included utensils or napkins. This is where I tell you that all this waiting was worth it.   Yep, you guessed it.  I would've gotten the same satisfaction with Wendy's spicy chicken nuggets.  The Hot and Spicy Beef were served cold in a pool of red chili garlic oil.  The $9 Hot and Sour seafood soup was just your measly Chinese buffet style hot and sour soup with 1, yes 1 baby shrimp and 4 squid and a 3 imitation crab leg piece.  This was an utter disappointment.  I ended up rinsing off the beef with water because it was soaked in oil and throwing half of the hot and sour soup away because there were no other edibles in it.  No tofu, no mushroom, nor bamboo shoots.  No pun intended but this entire experience left me with a hot and sour taste in my mouth.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone considering there are many other choices in the same vicinity.  Thank you all for reading and happy eating!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Definitely an authentic Chinese restaurant. (*Note: Although the name of the restaurant sounds Japanese; it's Chinese cuisine all the way.)

We came in a group of 5-- a group of hungry people. We had researched the restaurant and we weren't disappointed. The menu had a variety of dishes, from vegetables to exotic foods to seafood and meat. 

We enjoyed the pot sticker combo (seafood, meat and veggie). 
The Kung Pao Chicken, a popular Sichuan dish in China--one that is usually a disappointment when prepared in this country--was good.
We also had the Thick Pan-Fried Rice Noodles with shrimp (which is actually wide, not thick!) The noodles we very tasty.
Finally we enjoyed the Sichuan sauce with tofu, which was wonderfully spicy.


The service was quite good, we would eat there again.

So we definitely recommend this restaurant."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Great authentic Chinese!
Love the Hot Pots!
Love the big portions to share!
Love the use of spices!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,So yummy..went there twice and love it...intestines is my fav...chicken in oil appetizer is also delish...never had it before ever.  A great place in Madison...I hope they stay around.
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Ichiban is up there with the best Chinese in Madison. 

Most of the menu is authentic with a few American standards thrown in.  Think General Tso's chicken. 

It's best to come with a few adventurous friends and order several items. The portions are huge for the prices.  String beans with or without minced pork and cumin lamb are my faves.  

I will be back. Soon."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I have been to Ichiban more than 10 times since it first opened ~ 2 years ago. When I first heard of their name, I thought it's a Japanese restaurant. But make no mistake, Ichiban serves up authentic Sze Chuan food. Their menu and taste are actually pretty similar to Fugu, but since Ichiban opened I frequent Ichiban so much more because parking is so much easier right in front of the restaurant itself or along one of the streets nearby (free in the evenings and weekends!). 

I have tried (and recommend) their spicy fish dishes. There are a couple of those in the menu. Together with the hot pot series (kidneys, intestines, fish and lamb). The claypot beef is a good dish too, it has smooth and tender pieces of beef with a medley of mushrooms in a nice stew. If you feel like taking a break from the meat (why would you), their Japanese style tofu is a nice choice, with bits of seafood on a plate of gently fried tofu rounds. 

Traditional Sze Chuan dishes are generally hot, spicy and oily. I like the oily part the least, and often find myself using their generous portion of rice to soak up the oil instead. Even though the food portions are great, they can get pretty pricey. An appetizer plus two main dishes can easily add up to about 30 or more for a party of two. It's also an excellent idea to go in larger groups, so you can order and try out more dishes on your visit. It's afterall a Chinese style restaurant, so ordering a number of dishes to share around the table is common tradition."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Japanese name, but good Chinese food! I went here with a group of 6 on a Friday night and was seated right away. The first thing that struck me about the menu was the variety of ingredients and also the number of different ways they prepared pork intestine. Our curiosity was piqued so when we asked the waitress about the intestine she was very helpful and recommended the crispy style. We ordered the cumin beef, ma po tofu, lamb with ginger and scallions, pan fried fish, and spicy crispy pork intestine. All of them were very good and, with the exception of the lamb and fish, pretty spicy. A few of my friends needed tissues to deal with their spice-induced runny noses. Anyway, I came out stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey, but I was very satisfied."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. It definitely leans spicier, more vegetable heavy, and more traditional than any other such restaurant in Madison that I've tried. Almost everything I've had (dine in and take out) has been fantastic. Some dishes are a little more typical of americanized spots (such as the lo mein), but still beat the other places in town.

One issue is that the full menu is not completely pulled into most of the online ordering services, so there can be some surprises if you order off of say, GrubHub. For instance, my favorite dish there is San Bei (three cup) Chicken -- Ichiban's menu lets you know that it is chopped and bone-in, GrubHub does not -- it was a little surprising though delicious."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,Hands down the best in the Midwest. do yourself a flavor and try the chicken shrimp with walnuts.
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"So I came to Madison hoping against hope that there would be a Chinese restaurant I could at least stomach. (Coming from a Chinese family, after living in California and visiting Taiwan every year... you get the picture.)
 
Imagine my surprise when the first Chinese place I go to is GREAT! My mom and I were both impressed. We had a great time talking to the two male waiters, who are both from the same hometown in China as my mom. Be prepared for the food to be spicy, but if you like that- this is the place for you.

Here's what I have tried so far, and every single one I fully endorse:
-Sichuan Style Cucumber Appetizer
-Spicy Stir Fried Green Beans
-Twice Cooked Pork with Black Curded Bean and Pepper
-Chicken with Three Pepper
-Sliced Fish with Salted Mustard Cabbage (it's a soup, don't be surprised, but IT'S SO GOOD. really spicy though.)

But everything is worth a try! Packed on weekend nights (with Chinese!), but the place is big so no worries."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,Had another great meal at Ichiban.  Arrived at 230 this afternoon -- still in time for the lunch specials which ends at about 3 o'clock. Ordered the Thai red curry with chicken served along with steamed rice. Service was excellent - no waiting and very pleasant waitress. Order came out promptly. The red curry was delicious. Always a good experience at this place.
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"On our road trip back home from Chicago to Minneapolis, we decided to stop in Madison for lunch.  After indulging in all kinds of bar food while on vacation, I was craving a different cuisine; so Chinese was the final decision.

The service we received was great, we were seated right away and our food came quickly after we'd ordered it. The waitress was helpful in aiding us with our decisions on what to get. My boyfriend and I started with some Hot & Sour soup then shared the Kung Pao Chicken and the Red Curry Chicken. Both dishes came with side bowls of rice (more than enough definitely).  The portions are large, so if you don't have a huge appetite I'd recommend sharing one dish between two people. 

I'm giving this three stars because the Sichuan pepper spice was good and left my mouth feeling slightly numb, but the food was overall A-OK. Some of the pieces of chicken in the Kung Pao dish were a little chewy and fatty which grossed me out a bit. The Red Curry Chicken was better and I enjoyed the snap peas, zucchini, and mushrooms which were part of the dish. The hot & sour soup was a little thicker than I enjoy but it warmed me up and was still okay!

This restaurant is a little unique because the SIchuan spice is so different and not many places specialize in dishes that use it. But honestly, I would have enjoyed some unhealthy, greasy ""mall"" chinese food more."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,Authentic Chinese food. Delicious and huge portions. You'll definitely be taking a box home and coming back.
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Very good, authentic Chinese food! The portions are large and easy to share with the whole family. My family doesn't like very spicy food, but if you ask, you can ask how spicy it is or to make it mild. Our family had the beef hibachi, fried rice, and steamed/stir fry vegetables. It was all very good! There are a lot of dishes to choose from. The service isn't the best-- not what you would suspect from a typical restaurant. Though, we got in, ordered food, and got it right away, so it's not much of a problem. Parking is an issue; we weren't sure where to park and parking in front of the restaurant is prohibited from 4-6 M-F. 

I would visit again!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I'll keep it short and maybe not so sweet... Not my favorite. 

The server/host whatever he was was kind or rude and the woman who brought our food from the kitchen didn't smile or say a word or respond when we thanked her.  No one checked up on us after we got our food and we had to get out of our chairs to go ask for our check

The food was sub par. The prices are high and I wasn't impressed.  I had sesame chicken and my friend had some sort of chicken that was basically tiny chunks of deep fried chicken that was kind of crunchy with no sauce,  gross. 

My chicken was ok... But it was a lot of breading and the sauce was too sweet. There are better options in Madison"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"My sister and I went there randomly one night and ordered braised chicken hot pot. Its my first time eating hot pot and I got to say I can make this at home and it would be better. I am no chef but I have Asian taste buds and this dish was a disappointment. It was basically boiled chicken in red pepper garlic oil, bean sprout and a whole lot of red pepper. It was just spicy... no other flavor was there and the chicken was not braised. 

The service was friendly and they tried to answer our questions but for the most part they neglected us. We had to ask for water refill twice (our mouths were on fire) and they never came to check in on us to see if we needed anything else. 

Although Ichiban is lacking in decor I got to say the feel of the place is pretty nice. I think they are still in the process of decorating so hopefully things will look better soon.

Overall it was fun eating out of a pot but for the most part dont try the braised chicken hot pot unless you like the burning sensation all over your mouth. However I am willing to give it another go. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong dish. Next time I'm going for the pig intestine hot pot and see how that one differs from the one I previously ate."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Since Orient House went downhill, I'm looking for a new delivery option. I won't pretend to have a sophisticated taste - I order General's chicken, chicken/mixed veggies, and spring rolls. 

Judging from the other reviews, Ichiban Sichuan has some great dishes, but my boring stuff isn't among them."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Had the spicy, crispy chicken. It was good. I just have a couple of caveats. First, there was no sauce. The picture I saw suggested a sauce accompanying the dish. I still liked it , I just added sriacha. Secondly there are no veggies in the dish, just a mass amount of chili peppers. I don't mind spice, in fact I love it and I consumed all my chicken, I just didn't see the purpose of one pound of chili peppers. Picture to follow. I will go again because I liked my food and the service was decent. Looking forward to trying one of their hot pots."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"I had read reviews about Ichiban and Fugu having both authentic Chinese cuisines in Madison.  I recently went to Fugu so I had to go to Ichiban.  

The staff allowed us to peruse the menu for a while before taking our order.  It's huge and many things sound yummy.  We spent some time trying to get a look of other's meals without being too obvious and rude. 

I decided to order 3 ingredient potstickers for all of us.  I love hot and sour soup so I ordered their sour and spicy seafood soup for myself, or so I thought.  They brought out a huge bowl of soup and three cups for everyone.  Thankfully, the others were willing to eat it.  I even ended up taking soup home.  The soup had a wonderful flavor and perfect heat.  The seafood was fake crab, canned shrimp and possibly octopus.  I didn't eat the krab or shrimp but the octopus was good.  The potstickers were great with a tasty soy sauce.

For entrees, one person got the mei fun which she loved and are it all up.  I got the shrimp in black bean sauce.  I wanted to go outside my comfort zone but I couldn't decide what I wanted so I went with a safe bet.  The other person ordered poached chicken hot chili sauce.  The waitress accidentally wrote sliced fish.  It was still amazing.  He'll try the chicken next time but it was still amazing.

Overall, the food was great and fast.  I hate to say but I like Fugu a tiny bit more.  Thus, the 4 star."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Amazing new chinese resturant in madison. Most importantly, its style is spicy szechuan which I love.My fav szechaun resturant in china town chicago is Lao Sze Chaun, which is by far the best chinese food place I have ever been to. I must say Ichiban is comparable to that. Food is awwsome,very spicy but in a great way. Service is a bit spotty, but they more than made up with the food. I will definitely go there again."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Get the string beans with garlic sauce.  I know, I know, how good can they be?  They're just freaking beans, right?  Get them.

The food is noticeably and consistently fresher and more flavorful than the other Asian delivery I've had so far in Madison.  Without digging around I can actually see vegetables and huge pieces of tender chicken in my Pad Thai. Yum."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Going to be a short review, as I just tried their delivery service on Sunday. But it's a happy one, too!

Was very impressed with their delivery. It came about 30-40 min after I ordered, which was about the amount of time they said it would take so I was prepared. It also arrived very hot which is a definite plus. 

I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and Potstickers. Both were delish! The chicken was in fairly large pieces, which I enjoyed because it made me feel like I was actually eating chicken. Too many times have I gotten those tiny pieces of fried something-or-other at other Chinese restaurants. Not here! There was also just the right amount of breading and sauce on the chicken. It was sweet and spicy but not too much of either. The broccoli was also cooked perfectly. Not soggy at all. Potstickers were very good. I like when they have a little bit of crunch to them on the ends, which these did. The dipping sauce was also yummy. I finished them in about 5 minutes. 

Besides eating the Potstickers all at once, the chicken entree is definitely enough food for 2 meals. You also get a side of white rice with your entree. Next time I order from here I will definitely attempt to be a bit more adventurous as some of the things recommended on here sound awesome!"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"The driver said we were 22 miles from them thats why it took 2 hours for delivery. However, we are 17 min 7.8 miles from door to door..Cashew chicken was garlic flavored, chicken tasted not fresh. Appetizer vegetable dumpling is bland filled with what tasted like greens of some sort? no taste. The order did not come with any sauces such as soy. Chicken and Shrimp TSO is ok, large chunks. Mongolian beef was fair. Smoothies were all good, but order was all mixed up.  We ordered online. No one calls u to confirm or informs u of any delays. It was snowing but not a blizzard."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Very authentic sichuan food. I got the mapo tofu, white chicken in chili oil, and spicy pork kidney. They could considering lowering their prices a bit, but the portions are substantial and the food is deliciousl"
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"When it's late on a Monday night and you don't want to venture out onto the snowy roads, there is always takeout and Ichiban was our pick.
I went with the spicy and crispy chicken and my girlfriend opted for the wonton soup.
The s/c chicken was interesting.  It doesn't come with a sauce (basically popcorn chicken bites) but the seasoning and breading was excellent.  You can't miss the floral heat from the sichuan peppercorns and the amount of hot pepper that was left was impressive.  The spiciness was not overbearing but definitely had a zip.
The soup was also solid.  The broth was well made and flavorful and the wontons did not suffer from the gumminess that is often the case.
Definitely think I need to return and try other dishes.  Fair warning: the menu is humongous so it may be a little tough at first to decide what to go for."
Ichiban Sichuan,chinese style kung pao chicken,"Was looking forward to good Chinese lunch so after driving by the Jade Palace down the street (scary) decided to try Ichiban.  Had to park on side street and walked past dumpster behind restaurants...disgusting smells and almost lost my appetite but pressed onward.  Girls were very nice.  Had hot/sour soup which was very good but some of the vegetables not cooked through.  Ordered orange pork,  broccoli on plate was ice cold, meat very flavorful but then came the long black hair in the food.   not mine, girls offered to comp soup which was nice but left hungry and disappointed."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"I'm baffled by the good reviews on here.  First, this is not a Japanese restaurant if the name suggested otherwise.  It really shouldn't even be considered a Chinese restaurant as the food does injustice to what is actually good Sze Chuan / Chinese food.  

Second, I'm not the best cook in the world, but I feel like I can stir fry green beans and sizzling beef (or ""hibachi beef"" as they call it) much better than this place.  The food was way too salty and tasted worse than the Chang Jiang Americanized stuff, especially given the not-so-cheap prices ($15 for the hibachi blob, $10 for the green beans). 

Third, tea is charged per cup ($1.75) with free refills.  Since it was per cup anyways, I asked to have a different tea from my co-diner, but the server was basically too lazy to brew two different kettles, so she told us that they only had one type of tea.  Sure.  They really should just charge per kettle, like almost every other Chinese restaurant in the country.

I really wanted to support Asian restaurants in Madison out of the hope that more will spring up, but this is just plain bad.

If you want to try what is actually good Sze Chuan food, please do yourself a favor and drive to Chinatown in Chicago and go to Lao Sze Chuan.  Then come back and revise your review for this place."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"Amazing authentic Sichuan Chinese food!! Don't come here if you're expecting your typical Americanized Chinese food, because they specialize in the typically spicy Sichuan cooking.

My personal favorites include the dry braised chicken with spicy sauce in hot pot (under gan guo), the spicy shredded potato, ox tongue (be adventurous! it's so good), and twice cooked pork.

Seriously the best REAL Chinese food I've had in Madison. A real local treasure."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"If you love spicy food, this is the place to go. They have legitimate Sichuan Chinese food that my family and I love. They can make any dish spicy and still taste unique and delicious. The prices are also reasonable, and the serving sizes are quite generous as well. One of the better Chinese restaurants in town."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"THE BEST Chinese food in Madison, hands down.

What I love about this place:
- authentic (many dishes which are difficult to find elsewhere)
- delicious! The meats are always unbelievably tender and the the food so flavorful (esp if you like spicy- which is what Szechuan cuisine is known for)
- can easily accomodate large parties 

Go there! Now!"
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"The name is confusing but it's a Sze Chuan Chinese restaurant, meaning its best dishes are really spicy.

I'd say the food is comparable to Fugu. To be honest (and don't kill me!), I don't notice a huge difference.

BUT, I will say that Ichiban does a MUCH better boiled beef dish than Fugu. A seasoned Sze Chuan chef drops dead every time Fugu makes that dish. Kidding. Kind of. Ichiban's version tops Fugu's bastardized one every damn time.

So if you like boiled beef (and if you haven't tried it, go for it! Its Chinese name literally translates to ""water-boiled beef"" though that is SO misleading because it's jam-packed with spicy chiles and Sichuan peppercorns. Be sure to drink some milk afterwards), go to Ichiban. Go out of your way to go to Ichiban. Other than that, if you have to choose between Fugu and Ichiban, go with whichever one is closer."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"I have been frequenting Ichiban for over a year at least once a month. The staff is always friendly. They have updated the dining area to be more comfortable and the menu to be more user-friendly. This food is authentic. That means it doesn't taste like Chang Jiang! Regarding authentic Chinese food, it costs a great deal more to make then your typical Americanized Chinese food. However, these prices are very reasonable. The portions are always adequate and the service is fast, especially at lunch!"
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,Awesome spicy beef noodle soup! Sichuan food is one of my favorite kind of authentic Chinese food
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"Ichiban is an excellent restaurant. The diners are almost all Chinese. I want to try everything but get timid when it comes time to order. The menu is huge and I cannot really tell what the dish is like before it arrives. The waitstaff speaks limited English and are unable to really help you out.

 I have been to Ichiban 3 times and each time I have enjoyed my meal. The food can be very oily but that is the case at Fugu as well, another authentic Chinese restaurant. Vegetables are fresh and crispy, tofu light and puffy and the sauces are diverse rather than everything tasting the same. My guy ordered the Cumin Flavored beef with Chili Sauce which was our least favorite dish. I have enjoyed the Sichuan sauce twice, once with chicken and once with tofu. I loved the Japanese Tofu in Hot Pot, Braised Vegetable with Shitake Mushroom and the Vegetable Dumplings. 

You must give Ichiban a try. i have never waited more than 10 minutes for my food to arrive.  I am hellbent on spending an evening there just interviewing folks about what they are eating.  I love moo-shu pork but this is a whole different ballgame."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"The food was very good. However, I want to talk about the man delivering the food.
1. NEVER said any polite words such as ""hello, bye and thank you"". (Not just me, I've asked several friends. They had similar experience.)
2. HANG up my phone before finishing talking.
3. LET me going out for dozens of meters to get the delivery with short sleeve and short pant when it was snowing heavily (about -5 F). AND he was unwillingly to walk towards me.
4. ALWAYS complain about the tips with really really bad temper. (I usually give about 10%)"
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"The food is my favorite Chinese in Madison. I always seem to find something new to order that never fails to impress. The food is great and one order always amounts to a full second meal. That said, definitely get take out or delivery. We dined in once and that was enough. Interior is really uncomfortable, has an odd layout, and is unattractive. There always seem to be lots of staff moving about the place but not really paying that much attention to customers."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"This place was a saving grace for me. Being from out of town and being used to a plethora of Asian cuisine being everywhere, I  couldn't believe how there were so few authentic Chinese places. It's like there is a drought of authentic Chinese cuisine and thankfully this was the ONLY watering hole. Their string bean with garlic dish is always a go to dish along with the ox tongue and tripe. The double cooked pork was great. The spicy crispy chicken and beef brisket hot pot was definitely a favorite with the chicken just being spicy enough and succulent. And last but not least, the spicy crispy fish as well. I really hope this place thrives so if I ever have to come back, this will be my go to place to feel at home."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"By far the best Chinese place in Madison. (Don't let the name fool you). 

Trust me, the best way to experience Ichiban is to go with a big group and order several dishes and eat family-style. This is usually NOT my preferred way to go, because I don't eat red meat or pork and don't want to limit others' choices. But my Chinese-American friend who I've gone with twice suggested this for the real experience, and it didn't disappoint. The great thing is that there are so many fantastic veggie options, there was more than enough for this to work out both times we've done this with large groups.

Best dishes I've had:
Pan Seared Pea Sprouts
Kung Pao Chicken
Singapore Mei Fun
Fish in Hot Chili Sauce
Sauteed Udon (with tofu) -- the udon noodles are made in-house, mmm
Spicy String bean (my fave, so crazy good)
Ma Po Tofu (there is one with and without pork)
Sichuan Eggplant

The service is super fast and last time I went with a gluten free friend, and the waitress was very knowledgeable and careful to tell her what did and did not have gluten. Like I said I think the way to go is eat-in, family style, although my good friends order take out from here all the time. Since there is very little in the way of good Chinese take out in Madison, it's a great option."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"Always count on Ichiban when we crave authentic Chinese!!! Everything we eat here is good. Wendy, the owner is the best!!! Love Ox Tongue appetizer,    Beef with spicy capsicum and spicy crispy fish!!!"
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"3 star is being nice.  I was here last month with colleagues from the office.  We ordered quite a variety to share.  The Mao pao tofu was delicious that day!  Couldn't wait to come back to have it again. 

Back today with the family for lunch...boy were we disappointed.  Ou Mao pao tofu had so much food enhancer my hubby and I could feel our lips tingling.  Not a good feeling.  Out beef lomein was greasy(especially since I asked for less oil).  The Chinese vegetable dish with fresh garlic was blah...lack favor & salt.  Where can we go for good healthy flavorful Chinese food????"
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"The Chinese food there is authentic to me a native Chinese, however there are some downside that just balance the good part out. 

1. The service is bad. Water didn't get refilled. The rice came long after the entree. 
2. I find the chicken pork there are in normal quality, but not the beef! I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup on the other day. The beef cubes were very hard to chew, seem to come from the bone junctions or who-knows-where parts of a cow (hoofs or intestines?). It tasted like the elastic band. I could even see the white artery tubes sticking out of the meat. Yak."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"Definitely an authentic Chinese restaurant. (*Note: Although the name of the restaurant sounds Japanese; it's Chinese cuisine all the way.)

We came in a group of 5-- a group of hungry people. We had researched the restaurant and we weren't disappointed. The menu had a variety of dishes, from vegetables to exotic foods to seafood and meat. 

We enjoyed the pot sticker combo (seafood, meat and veggie). 
The Kung Pao Chicken, a popular Sichuan dish in China--one that is usually a disappointment when prepared in this country--was good.
We also had the Thick Pan-Fried Rice Noodles with shrimp (which is actually wide, not thick!) The noodles we very tasty.
Finally we enjoyed the Sichuan sauce with tofu, which was wonderfully spicy.


The service was quite good, we would eat there again.

So we definitely recommend this restaurant."
Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"Great authentic Chinese!
Love the Hot Pots!
Love the big portions to share!
Love the use of spices!"

Ichiban Sichuan,cucumber and chinese dip,"The ma la is real.  I was so pleased to find a Chinese menu that wasn't full of the standard Americanized fare, and the food delivered.  

I ordered the fried shredded beef in chili sauce and the cucumber with Chinese dipping sauce to cool things down.  The entree was well balanced with nice florals coming through from the peppercorn and plenty of aromatics.  I ordered it ""spicy"" which is one step down from the hottest and found it to be just right (I love spicy food, but I don't like it so spicy that I sweat.).   Again, the peppercorn came through but was not so heavy handed that I felt like I just went to the dentist.  

I am sad that this place isn't near my home, but I will certainly come back next time I'm in Madison."

Five Star Korean BBQ,pulled pork perfection sandwich,"I'm giving this place a 5 start rating because, I do believe it's as good as it gets for authentic Korean food in Madison. Having been to Korea several times to visit family I think I'm an ok judge in authenticity of flavor. 

The ambiance and decor of the place is okay. It used to be a BBQ place. Their menu has a lot of various korean BBQs. You don't get to cook them at tableside, that requires a more advanced setup and a better HVAC system. Another table ordered some and it did come out pretty quick and sizzling hot. They also have a variety of soups, lunch time specials, and appetizers. 

I ordered the Gam Ja Tang. Which is pork and potato soup and with various veggies. I enjoyed the flavor very much and it is a bit spicy but I like spicy. it was a massive bowl!  We also got Dol sot bulgogi bi bim bap. I say if you're going to get bi bim bap its so worth it to pay a couple of dollars more to get it in the hot stone bowl. I love the way the heat crispens the rice at the bottom. We also got the seafood pancake which was tasty. Even really good as leftovers. The pancake is HUGE. At home we heated it up in a pan with some oil and it got it all nice and crispy on the outside again.

The banchan here was good. The kimchi tasted almost perfect to me. Which is also why I choose to give this place a high rating. Good kimchi is a must for me since it is such a staple of Korean cuisine. 

The waitress stopped by to check us on periodically. Was attentive and really wanted feedback on what we thought of the food since they've been only open for 3 weeks. The cook came out and apologized for the appetizer (seafood pankcake) taking awhile since she had made one and didn't feel it was up to par so made a new one.

Most of the korean places around Madison are more fusion style and not authentic. There is one place on the west side that serves traditional Korean fare but I think the flavors at Five Star Korean BBQ are more on point."
Five Star Korean BBQ,pulled pork perfection sandwich,"Warning: THIS IS KOREAN FOOD, not American BBQ. I can't tell you how many times, while eating with friends, I've seen people come in thinking it's American BBQ because they see 5 Star BBQ. So if you're checking the out via Yelp first...good for you. Now you know. 

This place is honestly a great place when comparing it to other Korean options in Madison. There are practically only 2-3 other options that are  1) overpriced, 2) too ""fusion""' for me, and 3) limited menus.

Service
This is something they will probably work on. It's honestly a family business where one sister is in the kitchen with a prep cook and the other sister is the server, hostess and all of the above. You have to be super patient and understanding considering their situation. I've thought about applying for a job there to help them out. Be kind y'all. 

Food
If you like spicy, they can make it habanero spicy so be cautious. I recommend everything. Gamja Tang (pork bone potato soup) had a nice kick to it and the potatoes were huge! The Samgyupsal Kimchi Bokeum was good. I'd recommend you ordering it with the tofu for $2 extra. Friends have ordered the Al Tang (fish soup) and it's soooo good. You have to get the Seafood Pancake as the appetizer. This is probably the best Seafood Pancake I've had in the Midwest. It almost takes like my Grandma's! 

Location
Pretty nice that they are located on the corner of Blair and East Wash. Lots of parking available. I'd recommend you carpool with friends if you can Justin case they get busy during the dinner time. It definitely got busy when I was there two different times with friends. 

Alcohol is available. Water is refilled often. Enjoy!"
Five Star Korean BBQ,pulled pork perfection sandwich,"The restaurant has now opened!! We ate here for dinner and are pleased that it's an authentic Korean restaurant with fresh ingredients and seasonings.  Our group had the Kalbi ribs, seafood tofu soup and  a pork tofu soup and everyone liked what they had ordered.  I appreciated that the tofu soup was not overly salty and had that authentic spiciness that built up as I was eating it.  Dinner included Banchan (side dishes) which included a few radish sides, broccoli, bean sprouts, and kimchi which was particularly good.  We will definitely be back."
Five Star Korean BBQ,pulled pork perfection sandwich,"Don't let the one-star yelp reviews dissuade you or you'll regretfully miss out on this gem. I've been to several Korean and Korean-fusion restaurants around Madison and this place is the most authentic in my opinion. 

In terms of the decor, it's not the greatest, but hey, I'm there for the food! We ordered the kimchi jjigae, pork bulgogi, and beef bulgogi (banchan is served as well). The food came out pippin' hot. Both bulgogi dishes were packed with flavor! Though I do think the kimchi jjigae could have used a bit more tweaking of flavor. Overall, still not disappointed. The service is quite good and our waitress was so incredibly nice. She reminded me of my mom!

A reviewer further down wished that this was an LA joint...which makes no sense because we're in MADISON. And as someone who has been had Korean food in both Los Angeles and Chicago...this place is still a home run."
Five Star Korean BBQ,pulled pork nachos,"I'm giving this place a 5 start rating because, I do believe it's as good as it gets for authentic Korean food in Madison. Having been to Korea several times to visit family I think I'm an ok judge in authenticity of flavor. 

The ambiance and decor of the place is okay. It used to be a BBQ place. Their menu has a lot of various korean BBQs. You don't get to cook them at tableside, that requires a more advanced setup and a better HVAC system. Another table ordered some and it did come out pretty quick and sizzling hot. They also have a variety of soups, lunch time specials, and appetizers. 

I ordered the Gam Ja Tang. Which is pork and potato soup and with various veggies. I enjoyed the flavor very much and it is a bit spicy but I like spicy. it was a massive bowl!  We also got Dol sot bulgogi bi bim bap. I say if you're going to get bi bim bap its so worth it to pay a couple of dollars more to get it in the hot stone bowl. I love the way the heat crispens the rice at the bottom. We also got the seafood pancake which was tasty. Even really good as leftovers. The pancake is HUGE. At home we heated it up in a pan with some oil and it got it all nice and crispy on the outside again.

The banchan here was good. The kimchi tasted almost perfect to me. Which is also why I choose to give this place a high rating. Good kimchi is a must for me since it is such a staple of Korean cuisine. 

The waitress stopped by to check us on periodically. Was attentive and really wanted feedback on what we thought of the food since they've been only open for 3 weeks. The cook came out and apologized for the appetizer (seafood pankcake) taking awhile since she had made one and didn't feel it was up to par so made a new one.

Five Star Korean BBQ,when in madison sandwich,"Disclaimer: as good as it was, one of the main reasons I'm giving this place a 5 is because it is one of the only places to get good Korean food in Madison. Being Korean, this is something I dearly miss. But be aware that this is not exactly ""Korean BBQ"" in the cook-the-meat-on-a-grill-in-front-of-you sort of way. They have a standard Korean menu with some Korean meats, along with sushi and other Japanese selections.

Food (4.5/5): We shared the galbi (beef ribs), which were my favorite, dolsot bibimbap, kimchi jeon (kimchi pancakes), and a spicy salmon roll. The galbi was seasoned with a yummy sweet and salty marinade and came out sizzling hot. It compared well with the galbi my mom makes, as well as galbi I've had in Korea. It definitely makes me wanna try the other, cheaper meats on their grill section. The dolsot bibimbap was pretty fantastic; I would definitely order it again. And the kimchi jeon was HUGE and the texture and flavor was on point. The spicy salmon roll was good, but I'm also not a huge sushi connoisseur so it wasn't my favorite. The banchan (extra side dishes) hit it out of the park for me. The cabbage kimchi was extremely delicious, as was the radish kimchi (my personal favorite)! They also gave us this sweet, soy sauce based potato banchan that was very delicious. Serving sizes were generous. We all had food babies afterwards, and we didn't even get to finish the jeon.

Atmosphere (3.5/5): Nothing special. Feels like they are still getting prepared.

Service (3.5/5): They are definitely still getting experience running the restaurant, as the service was sometimes slow, but we didn't mind as we conversed and waited for the food (or ate the food after it was out). We never ran low on water though, so nothing to complain about, just don't be in a rush to leave. They were all very friendly.

Overall: Best Korean food I've had in Madison so far. I still need to check out some other places, but so far I have not been impressed by other offerings. Only complaint is it is a bit pricey, but I guess that is expected for Korean food in Madison. It is still worth it since you'd have to drive to Chicago (or cook it yourself) to get good Korean food otherwise. I will definitely be checking out more of their dishes soon, and updating this review. Check it out and give them some business so that good Korean food will stay in Madison!"

Five Star Korean BBQ,when in madison sandwich,"This place fills the hole that is missing in Madison's culinary landscape. They serve good and diverse Korean food in the campus/capital area. The location might make them overlooked by people, not to mention their facade is a old bar with minimal focal point.

Pro:
- Diverse menu offering 
- Generous portion
- Serves Banchan () - assortment of side dishes serves as appetizers

Con:
- Limited staff (I did not experience this problem, but it might affect their service during busy hours)
- Hours seems irregular (would recommend calling them before going there)

My friend and I ordered:
- Kimchi Pajeon (Kimchi pancake) -- the pancake is fluffy and the spiciness is just enough to make the food enjoyable. The kimchi in our portion was not strong enough, however.

- Budae Jigae -- it has generous portion of carbs, protein, and vegetables. The broth has some spicy kick to it, which is great. Meat lovers please beware that this menu has more carbs than the proteins. They do include proteins such as tofu, spam, and bacon, but you might want to adjust your carnivorous expecation accordingly.

- Jajangmyeon with seafood -- your classic black soybean paste noodles, but ten times better with seafood. They have crab and clam, which add a spin and add a great depth of flavor to the sauce.

Please do not complain when you see the menu and see average price of $11 - $16 per dish. Their size is hearty, and it can worth 2 - 3 meals. 

There were only 3 people in the kitchen who juggles between prepping the food and servicing customers. I would advise people be more considerate and patient. We were actually amazed because they are really quick on their feet in serving us and constantly checking our needs. Best of all - they keep their smiles at all times.

I am quite excited to try other dishes to this new addition in the Madison foodie community."
Five Star Korean BBQ,when in madison sandwich,"I've been alive over 10,000 days. I've also had over 10,000 home-cooked Korean meals made with love by Korean moms. After eating here, I can confidently say that they serve quality, home-cooked style Korean food with the same kind of care that Korean mothers put into their cooking when serving their children.

My SO and I were let-down by the food at Sujeo and New Seoul Korean, and came to this place not expecting much. We were surprised to find such tasty, authentic Korean comfort food here in Madison! As stated in other reviews, don't come here looking for decor, atmosphere, or some sort of fancy spin on Korean cuisine. But do come here for the hearty soups, the piping hot and flavorful meats, and generous complimentary (as per Korean tradition) side dishes. Your stomach and soul will thank you."

This place definitely is under the radar which is great but i need to spread the love. I brought a few friends with me to eat here and they are beyond satisfied.. the side dishes were how they were suppose to be free of charge which is what made me happy lols. Belly is full and happy thank you 5star korean bbq for the delicious food!

Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Had the signature breakfast sandwich. It was phenomenal. Herb cream cheese, fried egg, greens, bacon. Yum! Frappe was okay. Tastes nothing like coffee..."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Yola's has been on my list to visit whenever I travel up to Madison but it's taken me a while to get around to it: I regret the wait! 

It's a smaller indoor space but with ample outdoor seating. You pay for the quality of the food - you certainly can get cheaper waffles from a different joint, but you won't find offerings like Yola's menu. The lavender and lemon scone was a revelation. The waffles were spectacular. 

If you're looking for an interesting, thoughtful take on breakfast food, Yola's is well worth the trip. If you're more of an equal opportunity, lowest-price-point-possible breakfast food, it might be a pass for you. I, however, have every intention of returning."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"The waffles were good, nothing too fancy. Coffee is generous pour, 50 cents for refills. They have a small kids area to play in while you wait or finish up. You bus your own table. Staff was very friendly. Overall, a nice little breakfast spot."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Ambience is cozy and very nice. Their waffles are good not the best , I have had better waffles. I also tried their portobello sandwich which was good.  However service leaves much to be desired. The first time I went it was fine, but in my most recent visit I was there around 4 p.m (they close at 4:30 p.m.) I asked for a waffle and the staff said it will take 10 minutes to make it. I grabbed a coffee and sat there till 4:30 . The waitress came with the waffle boxed, just kept the box in the table and said its late and so she did a carry out and left the table in a hurry.  While I understand she wants to leave work, I was quite disappointed with her attitude and the way she handled it.  I did express my disappointment to her and left the place."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Yola's is a really nice quiet place to grab a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast in the morning.
Their banana chocolate chip bread is one of the best morning breads I have had at a coffee shop. I almost feel guilty eating it, it is so good.
Their breakfast sandwiches are also great. I often get their BLT with avocado as a light tasty lunch when I am in the area.
I love that they have Door County flavored coffee, as it is one of my favorite types of flavored coffee and reminds me of the feel and tastes of the peninsula every time!

I come in to work at Yola's for a whole morning once every few weeks and the staff are very kind and personable.

One of my favorite coffee places on the west side, and really echos the experience of the coffee shops you see on State St."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"I visited Yola's Café for the first time and experienced the equivalent of death by a thousand paper cuts.  While I liked Yola's family-friendly coffeehouse concept, a series of service missteps and lackluster execution of the food order made for a less than stellar experience.

While waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I hungrily spied the butterscotch and chocolate chip scone in the display case on the front counter.  We recently basked in the glory that is the oatmeal butterscotch cookie from Batch Bakehouse and hoped Yola's would provide us with a west-side fix for our new butterscotch addiction.  Alas, it was not to be.  The scone was overly dry and lacked the richness of the scones from the aforementioned Batch.  

When my wife arrived, there were a steady stream of customers pouring into the café.  After a short wait, a rather stoic gentleman took our order.  He did not greet us, hardly smiled and did not offer any recommendations as we made our picks from the menu.  Frankly, it was a little awkward.  I did score the free 16 oz. coffee offered with a Yelp check-in (thank you, Yelp!).  When we finished ordering, my wife and daughter each asked for a cup of water, which also drew a blank expression from our stoic friend.

We took our number and trudged off to a table, which the party at the neighboring table was using to discard their dirty dishes.  All the unoccupied tables had dirty dishes and were in desperate need of a good wipe down.

After a short wait, stoic dude arrived with my daughter's fruit cup.  At the counter, stoic dude told us the fruit cup contained strawberries, blueberries and pineapple.  What we received was a cup full of cantaloupe and honeydew (which my daughter is not a fan of).  To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.

After another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.

For what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.

I finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.

Other observations:
* The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent.
* The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors. 
* On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.

So, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Who could say no to a freshly made Belgian waffle, made from a family restaurant with a secret ingredient, all topped up with strawberries and whipped cream? Not many. This is the featured item on Yola's breakfast menu, along with a few egg dishes, oatmeal, yogurt and bakery.  The lunch menu offers a pretty standard selection of soups and salads, and the drink menu is cafe-standard as well. On my last visit I ordered a smoothie, which was ok but topped with completely deflated whipped cream. :(

The atmosphere is comfortable and seems to attract a varied crowd. There is free wireless and plenty of outlets, also some great patio seating. I must say I particularly enjoyed the cafe's selection of music. Yola's is relatively new (it replaced the west end location of Crema Cafe a few months ago) and still putting itself together, so for now I'll say this place is only A-OK, but offers a lot of potential to become something much more than that. Only time and waffle cravings will tell..."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,The cafe itself is really nice and would be a great place to grab a coffee and relax. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is the 'loaded breakfast burrito' is mediocre and had almost no bacon. Recommend the cafe but not the breakfast burrito.
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"We also really want to like Yola's since we live so close. Cute place. I ordered the waffle wo whipped cream. It came w it anyway. I ordered a side if bacon. It is totally fast food style bacon that should be hidden on a sandwich. The 4 slices didn't add up to one normal piece. 

The staff were distracted and not helpful. Not worth the price. Total bummer!"
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"I'm at Yola's at least once a week, sometimes more. I'm one of the moms with kid(s) (well, just one infant, to be precise). I LOVE it here, it's my go-to. The barristas (especially one and I have to learn her name) know my order every time and I rarely have to actually say it. It's nice to have somewhere to unwind and just ""be"" for a time. They have a variety of seating - comfy chairs, solitary tables, group tables, tables near the play area. They also have a great fireplace feature in the center as well as an overall ""homey"" feeling. It's my (calm) home away from my (hectic) home.

Their food is delicious - the waffles are amazing and the California sandwich is my lunch staple when I've lingered a little too long for good conversation and end up with two meals there.

There is typically a very diverse crowd - businesspeople, college students, moms and tots, and the lone wolf. All seem content and right at home."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"I was slightly disappointed on my first visit to this cafe.  Although I appreciate a variety of breakfast options, neither item we ordered stood out.  With a variety of breakfast hotspots around Madison, I would only suggest this cafe if you happen to already be in the neighborhood.  An additional charge for ""real"" maple syrup on an average waffle was a bit disappointing.  The actual space was quiet and somewhat clean.  Signs on every table instructing you to ""buss your own table"" were rather uninviting.  Overall, a bit pricy for the experience provided... very average."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"IDK, not that great but to be fair got sandwiches. The waffles probably look/are better. The coffee was good. Prices are a bit meh. We ordered something sans bacon and realized we paid $2 more than we needed if we used the ""build your own breakfast sandwich"" option. Kinda disappointed, as new customers, we weren't at least alerted to a better option, price-wise. A bit busy for seating so make sure  you get a nice spot. Outdoor seating looked good for a warm day. The ""home made"" salsa that came with it and chips was very meh to me. It tasted like jarred ortega or something and the chips were like those bite-size tostitos."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"The waffles here are amazing! I have had the strawberry and the blueberry on separate occasions, and neither time was I disappointed. I only wish they stayed open longer... I am fond of eating breakfast for dinner."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"I visited Yola's Cafe for the first time today with a friend of mine and her two young sons. I loved the vibe of the cafe. They have three sections to sit in with a variety of tables and comfy chairs. The center section has a fireplace which I can imagine being very nice on cooler days! 

There was a variety of customers, including business people, young adults, and people with children. The cafe is very family-friendly. We sat at a nice table right by a small play area for the children. I like how the play area is in a corner and provides kids with kitchen-play options, puzzles, books, games, and chalkboards. My friend's sons had a great time and loved the food! 

There is a good selection of food and drinks. The food comes out fresh and warm! My friend ordered a waffle topped with strawberries, blueberries, and whipped cream. She and her boys enjoyed it and it was a good amount for the price. I had a breakfast sandwich. It comes on a bagel or english muffin with either sausage, ham, or bacon, along with eggs and cheese. It was delicious! When I go back, I'd like to get a homemade smoothie and one of their lunch sandwiches. 

The wall art seemed a little random, but I realized that all of the pieces were designed by the same artist, which I thought was neat. They also had cards, jewelry, and other little things made by local designers for purchase. 

Such a nice place! I will definitely be going back."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,Very friendly server. Very cozy coffe shop atmosphere. Breakfast sandwich was hot and delicious and the coffee is great. Ready to go back and try one of those great looking waffles!

Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Yola's is a great local place to grab some brunch and coffee. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, w/ Christian-labeled music playing softly in the background. When you come for breakfast, get a Belgium waffle - it's what they're known for. They have gluten-free options too. If you're in the area, give them a visit!"
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"We have been coming here for years!!! Their waffles never disappoint. We had the nutty banana, country breakfast and my favorite pecan!!  Love their coffee as well. Haven't been so much of a fan of their baked goods though. Must visit if u are a waffle fan."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"This restaurant is a small coffee shop. We usually go there for breakfast and they have a great breakfast sandwich. The waffles are also very good.  The price is slightly higher than I would expect, but the food is still good."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"This morning my sister and I went to Yola's for breakfast before work.  I ordered a soy latte.  My sister ordered a frappe. We took our number to a table near the front, and the barrista, a youngish woman with dark hair, brought out my drink after about ten minutes.  This wait was obviously longer than what you would have at a coffee shop such as Starbucks, but because of the independent family-run nature of the business we were understanding of this at first.  My drink was made in a mug instead of a to go cup which would have been fine but like I said.  This was supposed to be just a breakfast stop. My drink tasted good and seemed to be what I ordered. My sister was not so lucky.  After over 30 minutes we really had to leave and she had still not received he drink!  Only about five customers had come through after us.  The workers were very disorganized and even though we had a number for our order the servers kept bringing us items that others had ordered.  Finally I went up to the counter to get a to go cup which the barrista reluctantly gave me.  My sister then asked about her drink.  The barrista, who had taken her order, was very confused about what my sister had ordered and couldn't seem to figure out how to make it even though it was on their menu.  The barrista did not apologize and she was pretty rude.  When she finally handed my sister a drink it was not only not a flavored frappe like she had ordered but a some kind of hot drink which my sister threw away as we left furious.  This is not our first bad experience with Yola's.  We kept going back wanting to like it, and sometimes their food, drinks and service are ok, but enough is enough.  The bad service and sometimes hostile staff ruins any other appeal this place has. Needless to say we will not be going back to Yola's."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"My family took a little lunch outing to Yola's last weekend.  I don't feel like I'm entirely qualified to write a full review, as all I had was a breakfast sandwich.  But, it was a very tasty breakfast sandwich with fresh ingredients, which is good in my book.  Everyone else in my party enjoyed their meals, as well.  I like the outside seating area - it's perfect for people with kids who like to run around and act unruly despite their mother's best attempts to keep them still! and respectable!  The woman working behind the register was also the woman who brought us our food. She was incredibly friendly and understanding. I will definitely be back to try more off of their menu."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Yola's is my friendly local coffee shop. I stop here pretty often for breakfast and coffee on the way to work. 
The food and pastries are very good! They have a good selection of gluten free items, too. They keep some seasonal items circulating, too. I've always felt very welcomed by the staff, too. The sandwiches are locally sourced and very delicious. The waffles are INSANELY good. 
The coffee is good, too. I usually get an espresso beverage, and there can be some difference depending on who is making the drink. The owners are, of course, the best at making the coffee drinks, so if you can catch one of them working behind the counter, do it! 
That's the other thing about Yola's I appreciate. It's family owned and run with a good family atmosphere. The owners and their family are often working behind the counter and socializing with the customers. I often see families, friends, and even business meetings going on. Yola's will also host events from time to time, and you can buy items such as jewelry, mugs, and cards from local artisans at the cafe. 

The food, beverage, and atmosphere are MUCH better than their corporate counterparts."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Cute little spot to grab a breakfast sandwich! Good customer service (but it can take a while at times.) The signature breakfast sandwich is large and delicious. It has herbed cream cheese, fried egg, greens, and bacon. I was excited to see that the fruit cup was very fresh and had raspberries and strawberries (which is much better from my perspective than pineapple and melon.) The location is a little hidden- you wouldn't really expect a cafe to be near all of the other shopping. The coffee is very delicious as well, strong but still drinkable.

Wifi, comfy seating, and a play area for children make this a good breakfast spot on the West side."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"I wasn't a huge fan of breakfast. They advertise serving breakfast, but they don't serve basic breakfast things like omelets. The waffle I had was good, and my girlfriend liked the coffee but didn't like her fritata. The place itself is nicely decorated and welcoming. So, I'd say go there if you're looking for a coffee shop, but look elsewhere if you want breakfast."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,Love the ambiance at Yola's . The veggie sandwich is delicious and gluten free. Cozy spot to meet for coffee or lunch!
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"My new favorite breakfast sandwich!  It's worth getting out of bed for on a Saturday morning. Steaming hot fried egg, a melty cheddar-herb cream cheese with a kick of garlic, and crisp greens on a super fresh, tender ciabatta. 

What sets this sandwich apart from the rest is the high quality of ingredients, the freshness of the bread, and the distinctive and flavorful cream cheese.

I'll be back to try more at yola's."
Yola's Cafe,yola's signature breakfast sandwich,"Total crap food
I came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .
wasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .
Would have rather stayed home for breakfast!!"
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"Yola's has been on my list to visit whenever I travel up to Madison but it's taken me a while to get around to it: I regret the wait! 

It's a smaller indoor space but with ample outdoor seating. You pay for the quality of the food - you certainly can get cheaper waffles from a different joint, but you won't find offerings like Yola's menu. The lavender and lemon scone was a revelation. The waffles were spectacular. 

If you're looking for an interesting, thoughtful take on breakfast food, Yola's is well worth the trip. If you're more of an equal opportunity, lowest-price-point-possible breakfast food, it might be a pass for you. I, however, have every intention of returning."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"The waffles were good, nothing too fancy. Coffee is generous pour, 50 cents for refills. They have a small kids area to play in while you wait or finish up. You bus your own table. Staff was very friendly. Overall, a nice little breakfast spot."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"Ambience is cozy and very nice. Their waffles are good not the best , I have had better waffles. I also tried their portobello sandwich which was good.  However service leaves much to be desired. The first time I went it was fine, but in my most recent visit I was there around 4 p.m (they close at 4:30 p.m.) I asked for a waffle and the staff said it will take 10 minutes to make it. I grabbed a coffee and sat there till 4:30 . The waitress came with the waffle boxed, just kept the box in the table and said its late and so she did a carry out and left the table in a hurry.  While I understand she wants to leave work, I was quite disappointed with her attitude and the way she handled it.  I did express my disappointment to her and left the place."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"Yola's is a really nice quiet place to grab a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast in the morning.
Their banana chocolate chip bread is one of the best morning breads I have had at a coffee shop. I almost feel guilty eating it, it is so good.
Their breakfast sandwiches are also great. I often get their BLT with avocado as a light tasty lunch when I am in the area.
I love that they have Door County flavored coffee, as it is one of my favorite types of flavored coffee and reminds me of the feel and tastes of the peninsula every time!

I come in to work at Yola's for a whole morning once every few weeks and the staff are very kind and personable.

One of my favorite coffee places on the west side, and really echos the experience of the coffee shops you see on State St."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"I visited Yola's Café for the first time and experienced the equivalent of death by a thousand paper cuts.  While I liked Yola's family-friendly coffeehouse concept, a series of service missteps and lackluster execution of the food order made for a less than stellar experience.

While waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I hungrily spied the butterscotch and chocolate chip scone in the display case on the front counter.  We recently basked in the glory that is the oatmeal butterscotch cookie from Batch Bakehouse and hoped Yola's would provide us with a west-side fix for our new butterscotch addiction.  Alas, it was not to be.  The scone was overly dry and lacked the richness of the scones from the aforementioned Batch.  

When my wife arrived, there were a steady stream of customers pouring into the café.  After a short wait, a rather stoic gentleman took our order.  He did not greet us, hardly smiled and did not offer any recommendations as we made our picks from the menu.  Frankly, it was a little awkward.  I did score the free 16 oz. coffee offered with a Yelp check-in (thank you, Yelp!).  When we finished ordering, my wife and daughter each asked for a cup of water, which also drew a blank expression from our stoic friend.

We took our number and trudged off to a table, which the party at the neighboring table was using to discard their dirty dishes.  All the unoccupied tables had dirty dishes and were in desperate need of a good wipe down.

After a short wait, stoic dude arrived with my daughter's fruit cup.  At the counter, stoic dude told us the fruit cup contained strawberries, blueberries and pineapple.  What we received was a cup full of cantaloupe and honeydew (which my daughter is not a fan of).  To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.

After another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.

For what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.

I finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.

Other observations:
* The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent.
* The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors. 
* On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.

So, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"Who could say no to a freshly made Belgian waffle, made from a family restaurant with a secret ingredient, all topped up with strawberries and whipped cream? Not many. This is the featured item on Yola's breakfast menu, along with a few egg dishes, oatmeal, yogurt and bakery.  The lunch menu offers a pretty standard selection of soups and salads, and the drink menu is cafe-standard as well. On my last visit I ordered a smoothie, which was ok but topped with completely deflated whipped cream. :(

The atmosphere is comfortable and seems to attract a varied crowd. There is free wireless and plenty of outlets, also some great patio seating. I must say I particularly enjoyed the cafe's selection of music. Yola's is relatively new (it replaced the west end location of Crema Cafe a few months ago) and still putting itself together, so for now I'll say this place is only A-OK, but offers a lot of potential to become something much more than that. Only time and waffle cravings will tell..."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,The cafe itself is really nice and would be a great place to grab a coffee and relax. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is the 'loaded breakfast burrito' is mediocre and had almost no bacon. Recommend the cafe but not the breakfast burrito.
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"We also really want to like Yola's since we live so close. Cute place. I ordered the waffle wo whipped cream. It came w it anyway. I ordered a side if bacon. It is totally fast food style bacon that should be hidden on a sandwich. The 4 slices didn't add up to one normal piece. 

The staff were distracted and not helpful. Not worth the price. Total bummer!"
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"I'm at Yola's at least once a week, sometimes more. I'm one of the moms with kid(s) (well, just one infant, to be precise). I LOVE it here, it's my go-to. The barristas (especially one and I have to learn her name) know my order every time and I rarely have to actually say it. It's nice to have somewhere to unwind and just ""be"" for a time. They have a variety of seating - comfy chairs, solitary tables, group tables, tables near the play area. They also have a great fireplace feature in the center as well as an overall ""homey"" feeling. It's my (calm) home away from my (hectic) home.

Their food is delicious - the waffles are amazing and the California sandwich is my lunch staple when I've lingered a little too long for good conversation and end up with two meals there.

There is typically a very diverse crowd - businesspeople, college students, moms and tots, and the lone wolf. All seem content and right at home."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"I was slightly disappointed on my first visit to this cafe.  Although I appreciate a variety of breakfast options, neither item we ordered stood out.  With a variety of breakfast hotspots around Madison, I would only suggest this cafe if you happen to already be in the neighborhood.  An additional charge for ""real"" maple syrup on an average waffle was a bit disappointing.  The actual space was quiet and somewhat clean.  Signs on every table instructing you to ""buss your own table"" were rather uninviting.  Overall, a bit pricy for the experience provided... very average."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"IDK, not that great but to be fair got sandwiches. The waffles probably look/are better. The coffee was good. Prices are a bit meh. We ordered something sans bacon and realized we paid $2 more than we needed if we used the ""build your own breakfast sandwich"" option. Kinda disappointed, as new customers, we weren't at least alerted to a better option, price-wise. A bit busy for seating so make sure  you get a nice spot. Outdoor seating looked good for a warm day. The ""home made"" salsa that came with it and chips was very meh to me. It tasted like jarred ortega or something and the chips were like those bite-size tostitos."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"The waffles here are amazing! I have had the strawberry and the blueberry on separate occasions, and neither time was I disappointed. I only wish they stayed open longer... I am fond of eating breakfast for dinner."
Yola's Cafe,create your own breakfast sandwich,"I visited Yola's Cafe for the first time today with a friend of mine and her two young sons. I loved the vibe of the cafe. They have three sections to sit in with a variety of tables and comfy chairs. The center section has a fireplace which I can imagine being very nice on cooler days! 

There was a variety of customers, including business people, young adults, and people with children. The cafe is very family-friendly. We sat at a nice table right by a small play area for the children. I like how the play area is in a corner and provides kids with kitchen-play options, puzzles, books, games, and chalkboards. My friend's sons had a great time and loved the food! 

There is a good selection of food and drinks. The food comes out fresh and warm! My friend ordered a waffle topped with strawberries, blueberries, and whipped cream. She and her boys enjoyed it and it was a good amount for the price. I had a breakfast sandwich. It comes on a bagel or english muffin with either sausage, ham, or bacon, along with eggs and cheese. It was delicious! When I go back, I'd like to get a homemade smoothie and one of their lunch sandwiches. 

The wall art seemed a little random, but I realized that all of the pieces were designed by the same artist, which I thought was neat. They also had cards, jewelry, and other little things made by local designers for purchase. 

Such a nice place! I will definitely be going back."

It has great atmosphere and varied seating, including various cafe tables, a few outdoor patio tables, and more comfortable spots near the fire. There is also a corner where kids can play, which isn't something I need but which would definitely be nice for those who do. 

The person we ordered from seemed somewhat new and unsure of herself, but she was very friendly and was able to get our order correctly and delivered in a timely manner. 

We sampled a Belgian waffle with chocolate chips (which was tasty) and a chocolate frappe and hot chocolate (both of which were nothing special). I'd have to try more food items to get a more solid feel for the food and drinks. 

My biggest concerns about Yola's have to do with the hours. I spend most of my time at coffee shops on Sundays in preparation for Monday due-dates, so the fact that it isn't open at all on Sunday is a big loss. Similarly, it would be a great venue for Friday or Saturday-night music or other acts, but the hours are pretty limited. Additionally, even though it is not evident in the decor or other areas, Yola's plays very obvious Christian music, which isn't my ""cup of tea,"" as they say."

To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.

After another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.

For what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.

I finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.

Other observations:
* The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent.
* The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors. 
* On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.

So, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Who could say no to a freshly made Belgian waffle, made from a family restaurant with a secret ingredient, all topped up with strawberries and whipped cream? Not many. This is the featured item on Yola's breakfast menu, along with a few egg dishes, oatmeal, yogurt and bakery.  The lunch menu offers a pretty standard selection of soups and salads, and the drink menu is cafe-standard as well. On my last visit I ordered a smoothie, which was ok but topped with completely deflated whipped cream. :(

The atmosphere is comfortable and seems to attract a varied crowd. There is free wireless and plenty of outlets, also some great patio seating. I must say I particularly enjoyed the cafe's selection of music. Yola's is relatively new (it replaced the west end location of Crema Cafe a few months ago) and still putting itself together, so for now I'll say this place is only A-OK, but offers a lot of potential to become something much more than that. Only time and waffle cravings will tell..."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,The cafe itself is really nice and would be a great place to grab a coffee and relax. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is the 'loaded breakfast burrito' is mediocre and had almost no bacon. Recommend the cafe but not the breakfast burrito.
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Pros: Kids play area. Cute place. My turkey salad sandwich was pretty tasty. 

Cons: Was served with bottom-of-the-bag chip crumbs and meh salsa. Not worth $9. Next time perhaps I'll try a waffle or go somewhere else."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"We also really want to like Yola's since we live so close. Cute place. I ordered the waffle wo whipped cream. It came w it anyway. I ordered a side if bacon. It is totally fast food style bacon that should be hidden on a sandwich. The 4 slices didn't add up to one normal piece. 

The staff were distracted and not helpful. Not worth the price. Total bummer!"
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"I was slightly disappointed on my first visit to this cafe.  Although I appreciate a variety of breakfast options, neither item we ordered stood out.  With a variety of breakfast hotspots around Madison, I would only suggest this cafe if you happen to already be in the neighborhood.  An additional charge for ""real"" maple syrup on an average waffle was a bit disappointing.  The actual space was quiet and somewhat clean.  Signs on every table instructing you to ""buss your own table"" were rather uninviting.  Overall, a bit pricy for the experience provided... very average."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"The waffles here are amazing! I have had the strawberry and the blueberry on separate occasions, and neither time was I disappointed. I only wish they stayed open longer... I am fond of eating breakfast for dinner."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"I visited Yola's Cafe for the first time today with a friend of mine and her two young sons. I loved the vibe of the cafe. They have three sections to sit in with a variety of tables and comfy chairs. The center section has a fireplace which I can imagine being very nice on cooler days! 

There was a variety of customers, including business people, young adults, and people with children. The cafe is very family-friendly. We sat at a nice table right by a small play area for the children. I like how the play area is in a corner and provides kids with kitchen-play options, puzzles, books, games, and chalkboards. My friend's sons had a great time and loved the food! 

There is a good selection of food and drinks. The food comes out fresh and warm! My friend ordered a waffle topped with strawberries, blueberries, and whipped cream. She and her boys enjoyed it and it was a good amount for the price. I had a breakfast sandwich. It comes on a bagel or english muffin with either sausage, ham, or bacon, along with eggs and cheese. It was delicious! When I go back, I'd like to get a homemade smoothie and one of their lunch sandwiches. 

The wall art seemed a little random, but I realized that all of the pieces were designed by the same artist, which I thought was neat. They also had cards, jewelry, and other little things made by local designers for purchase. 

Such a nice place! I will definitely be going back."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Step one: buy a waffle maker. 
Step two: charge people for your mediocre waffles. 

I think this is Yola's business plan, though I am not certain. 
My waffle was nothing special...it was even a little cold when it got to my table. I was disappointed."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Decor is cute but it doesn't go together at all and although i'm sure they are doing that on purpose and going for a charming/quaint look it really isn't working. 

I had a black coffee and plain waffle. Waffle was amazing (of course:)) and delivered very promptly. Coffee wasn't freshly brewed and the canister of the medium roast was out (and i didn't want to wait for them to fill it) so i just got the dark roast. It was decent but not great coffee.

There was an assorted group of people at 10am on a weekday--moms with their kids, businessmen having a meeting, a guy meeting his contractor, and the hippy college kid. It was a fun crowd.

If im in the area and really needing caffeine i might be back but no special trips out here."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Yola's is a great local place to grab some brunch and coffee. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, w/ Christian-labeled music playing softly in the background. When you come for breakfast, get a Belgium waffle - it's what they're known for. They have gluten-free options too. If you're in the area, give them a visit!"
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"I enjoyed my visit to Yola's today. 

Highlights: Patriot waffle - a nifty combo of a Belgian waffle with strawberry, blueberries and whipped cream (red, white and blue, eh!?!). It was very tasty, and not to pricey at $6.49. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure it was ""strawberry"" and not ""strawberries"" since there was not a huge amount of fruit on the waffle. I gave it a little dash or syrup and all was well, though. 

I liked the Yelp check-in offer of a free 16-oz hot coffee with purchase, which went perfect with the waffle. Service was nice, and the waffle was up before I even got my laptop fired up. I'm pretty sure the owners were working behind the counter, which is always a good sign. About the only downside I could find was the contemporary Christian music on the house sound system.  I've nothing against that type of music, but its just a bit overt for me. To each his own, I guess.

All things considered, a nice coffee shop with a good vibe, and I see they have a kids play area, which is a nice touch for a neighborhood gathering place. Much success to you, Yola's Cafe!"
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"We have been coming here for years!!! Their waffles never disappoint. We had the nutty banana, country breakfast and my favorite pecan!!  Love their coffee as well. Haven't been so much of a fan of their baked goods though. Must visit if u are a waffle fan."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"This restaurant is a small coffee shop. We usually go there for breakfast and they have a great breakfast sandwich. The waffles are also very good.  The price is slightly higher than I would expect, but the food is still good."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"This morning my sister and I went to Yola's for breakfast before work.  I ordered a soy latte.  My sister ordered a frappe. We took our number to a table near the front, and the barrista, a youngish woman with dark hair, brought out my drink after about ten minutes.  This wait was obviously longer than what you would have at a coffee shop such as Starbucks, but because of the independent family-run nature of the business we were understanding of this at first.  My drink was made in a mug instead of a to go cup which would have been fine but like I said.  This was supposed to be just a breakfast stop. My drink tasted good and seemed to be what I ordered. My sister was not so lucky.  After over 30 minutes we really had to leave and she had still not received he drink!  Only about five customers had come through after us.  The workers were very disorganized and even though we had a number for our order the servers kept bringing us items that others had ordered.  Finally I went up to the counter to get a to go cup which the barrista reluctantly gave me.  My sister then asked about her drink.  The barrista, who had taken her order, was very confused about what my sister had ordered and couldn't seem to figure out how to make it even though it was on their menu.  The barrista did not apologize and she was pretty rude.  When she finally handed my sister a drink it was not only not a flavored frappe like she had ordered but a some kind of hot drink which my sister threw away as we left furious.  This is not our first bad experience with Yola's.  We kept going back wanting to like it, and sometimes their food, drinks and service are ok, but enough is enough.  The bad service and sometimes hostile staff ruins any other appeal this place has. Needless to say we will not be going back to Yola's."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"I have a difficult time with Yola. I really, REALLY want to like them. 

THEY OFFER GLUTEN-FREE BELGIAN WAFFLES! They used to be SO GOOD!

But the last four times I've been in there, my waffles have been raw in the middle, or I've gotten very sick right after eating them (I don't know if they use the same waffle maker for their non-GF waffles, or what, but it's not acceptable either way.)

Their staff is always *very* friendly (though generally either over-staffed or under-staffed,) and they were one of the first places in Madison to offer almond milk in their beverages, which was great for someone like me, who is both lactose and soy-intolerant.

But like someone else said, the other issues they face are like death by a thousand papercuts. And after getting sick, I just haven't gone back.

It makes me sad, because that part of the west side really needs a solid coffee shop. I wish Yola's still fit the bill."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Yola's is my friendly local coffee shop. I stop here pretty often for breakfast and coffee on the way to work. 
The food and pastries are very good! They have a good selection of gluten free items, too. They keep some seasonal items circulating, too. I've always felt very welcomed by the staff, too. The sandwiches are locally sourced and very delicious. The waffles are INSANELY good. 
The coffee is good, too. I usually get an espresso beverage, and there can be some difference depending on who is making the drink. The owners are, of course, the best at making the coffee drinks, so if you can catch one of them working behind the counter, do it! 
That's the other thing about Yola's I appreciate. It's family owned and run with a good family atmosphere. The owners and their family are often working behind the counter and socializing with the customers. I often see families, friends, and even business meetings going on. Yola's will also host events from time to time, and you can buy items such as jewelry, mugs, and cards from local artisans at the cafe. 

The food, beverage, and atmosphere are MUCH better than their corporate counterparts."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Cute little spot to grab a breakfast sandwich! Good customer service (but it can take a while at times.) The signature breakfast sandwich is large and delicious. It has herbed cream cheese, fried egg, greens, and bacon. I was excited to see that the fruit cup was very fresh and had raspberries and strawberries (which is much better from my perspective than pineapple and melon.) The location is a little hidden- you wouldn't really expect a cafe to be near all of the other shopping. The coffee is very delicious as well, strong but still drinkable.

Wifi, comfy seating, and a play area for children make this a good breakfast spot on the West side."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Beautiful place with excellent menu choices, warm family atmosphere, and a passion for people. They bring the food out to you after you order, so you can sit down, relax, talk, or get to work on your computer with their free wi-fi.

Be sure to enjoy a waffle, or get yourself a triple shot of espresso!"
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"I wasn't a huge fan of breakfast. They advertise serving breakfast, but they don't serve basic breakfast things like omelets. The waffle I had was good, and my girlfriend liked the coffee but didn't like her fritata. The place itself is nicely decorated and welcoming. So, I'd say go there if you're looking for a coffee shop, but look elsewhere if you want breakfast."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Delicious Coffee and Waffles!

I love stopping in Yola's after working out at the Princeton Club. They have really good iced coffee and the place always smells so good. Once in a while I'll get a waffle, but you have to make sure you have a lot of time because if you order a waffle or speciality coffee it takes a while for them to prepare it."
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,I work nearby and have always wondered how this place was. The price was good and the food was average. I had a chocolate chip scone and a belgian waffle. The scone was tasty but the waffle was nothing special. The atmosphere was pleasant but I don't think it was enough for me to return any time soon.
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"Total crap food
I came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .
wasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .
Would have rather stayed home for breakfast!!"
Yola's Cafe,kid's waffle breakfast,"This place is okay. We were there early in the morning, so we were the only customers. The coffee was way to strong and our food was only lukewarm when we got it. Their Belgium waffle could have been great, but it was not even warm enough to melt the butter they brought with it. I think this place has a lot of potential, but I probably wouldn't go back anytime soon."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,Great food that mostly seems to be made in house. The prepackaged house salad was surprisingly delicious! Excellent customer service and a willingness to customize dishes. You can add seasonal veggies to the pastas and can get a homemade chocolate chip cookie all for free! Will definitely be returning. Not sure how I managed to miss this gem for a whole year.
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"I love crostini's food, I really do. Unfortunately, their customer service is lacking terribly. I have ordered about 10 times and half the time I usually end up with something wrong or missing. I let it go because the food is still good. 

Today, I couldn't answer the phone when they called because I was on the other line with a client, so I ran downstairs because I figured the call meant they were here. I waited at my front door for 10 minutes and no one came. 
A half hour later I called the shop asking if my food was on its way (it'd been 1 hr 15 min) and they told me the driver said I didn't answer my phone OR door. The driver never even came to my door, I was down there waiting for him. And to call once and leave it at that? Terrible customer service. It's now been an hour and 25 minutes that I've been waiting for ONE SANDWICH. 
Twice in the past the driver did not have change with him when he showed up for a delivery. They need to get themselves together or hire a new staff.

UPDATE: they ended up comping my food, so I upgraded the review to 3 stars."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"With a few exceptions, I've never met an owner of a local sandwich shop who takes so much pride in his work, and offers such outstanding customer service - not only from himself, but from his employees as well. Crostini wants you to have a great sandwich and a great experience ordering it, paying for it and, eventually, eating the glory that is their food. 
With that said, I have to say that everything on their menu is a testament to the management and ownership WANTING you to have a great meal; not just wanting to make a buck. To wit: I've trod nearly every item on their menu (they're in my neighborhood) and have had the experience of a few sub-excellent sandwiches. This isn't to say they were bad, but merely not amazing. 
The owner and staff recognize my face from so many visits and often ask me about how my last sandwich was. Being a former chef, I'm not too afraid to speak truth to their queries. On the rare occasion that something wasn't up to mine, and presumably their, incredibly high standards - they took my comments in stride and more often than not I would later find the item either removed from the menu or re-tooled into a culinary masterpiece of sandwich art that is their forte. 
With all that backstory aside, I just can't speak highly enough about their food. My go to sandwich, for when I just don't even want to think about what would taste amazing while satiating both myself and my wife, is the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. Its simplicity is sublime, its execution near flawless (maybe 1/3 less mayo and 1/2 more lettuce would help it reach nirvana). Spicy, but not unbearably so, it comes with an assortment of flavor profiles that meld into a thing of beauty. 
If you're looking for something more simple, and possibly more Chicagoan (you damn FIB), their various Italian beef incarnations are all equally perfect in their own special way. 
My cut and dried, highly compressed review of the place would be this:
""If your sandwich doesn't taste amazing, it's because you chose something you weren't in the mood for, not due to any issues with the recipes or a failure of a dutiful lack of execution.""
All in all, Crostini is a little miracle on North St. 
In a space once operated by Milio's; slanging bottom of the barrel meats and vegetables for an equivalent price - there now stands a shop so invested in your gastronomical pleasure that they offer free homemade (delicious) chocolate chip cookies to all comers, and, with the utmost sincerity, want you to become addicted to their food. 
I wish every person in the world the ability to dine on one truly delicious sandwich in their life. 
I'm proud to say that the location to achieve that aim in just two blocks from my house, on the near East-Side. 

Insiders aside: always ask about their specials. Yet another facet of this place that has never let me down, so long as it was something I was in the mood for."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,Wow so disappointed. I just picked up a bowl of their homemade chicken noodle soup which is just a big bowl of noodles in water with a couple of dry pieces of chicken and a couple of chunks of vegetables no flavor very very disappointed... I would have just opened a can of soup at home if I would have known!
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"Food is great.  Customer service is one of the worst I have ever had!  I have ordered from them 3 times.  Each time I had a worse experience than the one before.  The first time, the order was about 15min. late, forgivable.  The second time, our order was over an hour late, no phone call to let me me know, Nothing.  The 2 times I called them, the response I got was ""the food was on it's way"".  Ok, shame on me for ordering from them again.  Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.  This time (today), food was an hour late and they forgot a sandwich.  I called and asked to speak to the manager, the response ""he's too busy!!""  I am still waiting for a phone call back.  Oh and the forgotten sandwich came 2.5 hours after it was suppose to be delivered!!

DO NOT EVER ORDER DELIVERY!!"
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,Waited over an hour for 2 sandwhiches and bowl of chili. Chili was warm at best and there was Mayo on the sandwich....got delivered 45 minutes after closing time so there is no one to complain to or to try and make it right.. Just an answering machine..WoW.
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"This sandwich shop is really great.  When you step in it's like going into one of those deli/sandwich places in a big city like NY or Chicago (I'm saying this from my own experience). It's cozy and there's a lot going on.  The prices are totally reasonable as well, you can get a lot of sandwiches for around $5 or less and they taste great!  I don't think most of the ingredients are local, organic or anything fancy like that but this is reflected in the low prices.  I've found a lot of sandwich/burger places charging $10+ for something made with the same quality ingredients. Also, a lot of their stuff is made in house (it's not just dumped from a Sysco freezer bag into the fryer) and tastes great.  A few sandwiches that I particularly like are the meatball sub, the tuna melt, and the Chicago hot dog.  Another great thing about Crostini's is that they deliver for a reasonable price (it's a $10 minimum and less than $2 delivery fee), so if you're feeling lazy or overwhelmed you can get your food brought to your door! All-in-all I highly recommend this place for a well-made tasty sandwich."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"I had pretty much been ignoring this place since it opened because I can't eat gluten, so I was assuming that sandwiches=glutenous bread. Last week my partner was all like, ""Ever been to this place?"" and I was all like, ""Um, I haven't been to a sandwich shop in years."" But he checked out the menu online and they had some gluten free options, so we decided to check it out. And I am so glad we did. Oh! You have no idea how wonderful it is to taste a damn good sandwich after years of eating bread that tastes like sand. I had the California Chicken panini. It was the stuff of dreams. Hot, gooey, cheesy, flavorful dreams. I am looking forward to our next visit!"
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"3.5 stars. Tasty sandwiches and specials. I've never had a problem finding a close parking spot. When they're cooking the spicy chicken I can't be in there (yes, it's that strong), but I always get my sandwich to go so not a problem."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"Great sandwich shop! Very accommodating of special food needs/requests. Wish there was a meal deal and better variety of sides, but the food is delicious and the prices are great otherwise."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"Worst service in Madison. We ordered online using grub pub, for delivery.  The order included one of their featured chicken sandwiches, two Chicago style hot dogs, one chili-mac, one potato and pasta salad.  The order took one hour and forty three minutes to arrive to the door, it was served by a delivery driver who was smoking a cigarette who appeared to have more people in the vehicle, the order was cold and incorrect.  I admit that delivery service in Madison slows down on a day that may have a few snow flurries, this day was no exception.  I do understand that when ordering on a day like this i may have to wait longer and that is perfectly fine, however, upon calling the restaurant and asking to speak with a manager, the man informed me that he was indeed the manager.  I then told him my food arrived cold and incorrect, and he told me that they could remake the order and it would be out to me in an hour and a half, for it takes one hour to prepare, and a half an hour to get to my door.  I expressed to the manager how long we had already been waiting to eat, and that we were not interested in waiting another hour and a half for the same cold food. The then told me that he could come back pick up the food and refund our money.  For all we wanted was to be full, we had began eating the cold food and this could not be an option. He then suggested that in the future if I want to order food that is delivered hot, I should order from a different restaurant with-in a block of my home.  Frustrated I told him that I would just write a review and I hung up the phone.  So here it is.  Ten minutes later, another ""manager"" called back concerning the order, he assured me that the next time i order it would be on them.  That's fine, however I don't think I'll be ordering from Crostini ever again, it should not take an hour to prepare a couple of hot dogs, a sandwich and a few sides.  Very disappointing, and to be told by one of their managers to just bring my business elsewhere if i want hot food, seems pretty ridiculous to me.  I also must admit I feel bad writing this review but it's simply the truth."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"I needed to grab something for lunch and feeling sick of the usual sandwich suspects of Subway and Milio's etc. I thought I would Yelp 'Sandwiches' near my work place. Crostini came up as 3 minutes away and had good ratings so I thought I would try it out. Together with two co workers we drove over there and were very impressed. We found street parking right across the street and the outdoor seating area looked nice. The daily special was listed on a chalkboard out front. Once inside there are seemingly endless delicious items to chose from on the menu boards. Finally, I opted for the Chicken pesto Panini and a Ceasar Salad along with the freshly brewed ice tea. My co workers order the Egg Salad Sandwich and Turkey Cran-Apple Chutney Panini and a chocolate malt. After a short wait one of the employees brought us our food to go. (I had read in the Yelp reviews some folks got a free cookie for their first visit, unfortunately, we didn't get one, either I failed to mention it was our first time or we weren't asked-oh well). 
At first I noticed there were no croutons on the ceasar salad and was momentarily disappointed, however, the parmesan on the salad made up for it as well as the awesome dressing and fresh lettuce as well as a hard boiled egg. I never ended up missing the croutons and think they would have been too filling and excessive.
My Panini was great. The portion size was very generous and there was no lack of gooey melted yummy cheese goodness. The chicken breast on the Panini was really good, flavorful and a nice cut of meet. The fresh avocado and spinach was tasty. My ice tea was also delicious, served with a fresh lemon slice (optional).
My co workers were also very impressed with their meals. 
We will be back!!!!!!!!!! And I will bring more customers."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"Best Chicago Italian Beef I have had outside Chicago. The owner recommended the Italian Beef. He was very friendly and helpful. The sandwich was perfectly crunchy and tasted fresh. Throw some fresh, homemade giardiniera on top and a free fresh baked cookie on the side. I'm sold."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"The sandwiches are delicious. It really seems like great care is taken with the food. 

The hot sandwiches hit the grill for a few minutes, worth the wait. The veggie panini has a great garlicky flavor, and is served on soft toasty bread. With a mixed veggie medley & cheese, it sounded strange but is an unlikely winner.  I bet any other veggie sandwich combos they come up with would be stellar.

The cold egg salad sandwich is solid too. 

Nice service."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,Absolutely delicious!!!! I had the California chicken sandwich and added red onions.  This is an amazing sandwich and I could eat this every day.  Their broccoli cheese soup is great!  Fast and friendly service.  I will definitely be going back here over and over and over
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"Get the Italian Beef. Amazing. I thought I'd had the best Italian Beef when Papa Coronofolous' was still open, but I was so wrong. When I opened the to-go box, my first reaction was to say. ""F**k yeah!"" This is a big sandwich with mozz and peppers (optional). And the price is not just reasonable, it's generous. Seriously, skip the chips, you won't finish them. But take the free cookie; they're awesome. Like a chocolate chip molasses cookie.

Crostini's may be a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but go a little out of the way. It's SO worth it."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"This is a tough one. The sandwiches are four-star, maybe five, but there were some bummers to the catering order I recently placed. Nothing horrendously wrong, by any means, but nothing that wowed me. A-OK describes my experience perfectly. 

+ You can place catering orders online through a popular Madison food delivery service. 
- There are no directions or details for catering orders; it lists the number of sandwich halves and cookies you'll get, but that's it. 
+ My delivery order arrived on time; I placed it three days before the event. 
- Despite putting detailed directions on how to find us (I was at a private party at a business), the driver couldn't find us and was wandering the apartment building next door. I was running an event in a basement-level business - if I hadn't had my phone or had reception I don't know if he'd had found us.
+ The sandwiches were delicious and came in a nice carrying case.
- The cookies had squared-off sides and looked to be mass produced. 
- There were no vegetarian options in the box even though they have a couple veggie subs on the menu. 
- There were no plates, napkins, or condiments; there was no mention of this, but for catering that's a pretty common inclusion. 

The most important thing, though, is the food, and the sandwiches got gobbled up in quick fashion. As a huge turkey sandwich fan, I can put my stamp on their version. It reminded me in one bite of the deli sandwiches I used to order when living out East. I had forgotten about these sandwiches entirely but their sauce/spices took me back. I will definitely order that sandwich again. It's nothing fancy, but I totally dug it. 

Looking forward to trying them in a non-catering capacity, and now that I've experienced their catering I know some handy facts for next time (such as trying to contact the store directly to inquire about including veg items in my order)."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"Yes, it doesnt have a bathroom, easy parking, and huge sandwiches, but what they do have are sandwiches with quality ingredients and tons of flavor.  I had the crostini club sandwich and was happy with the all of flavors going on inside.  I'll be back for the italian beef shortly and I can't wait"
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"After hearing amazing things about Crostini, I was completely disappointed. Hype. That is all this place has. I was under the impression from the website and pictures it was a cafe of sorts. It was tables out front. 

Well it turns out, it is basically a counter place with a few tables available. The space is cramped and there are no public restrooms.  This would be nice to know. Please post a sign. Otherwise, your patrons will have to wait in line to ask for a bathroom and then find out there isn't one. That is pretty time consuming and annoying for goodness sake.  They then sent me to a neighboring business which had disgusting bathrooms. Not necessarily their fault but don't send your patrons to a dirty place because that still reflects on you.

Parking. Ugh. Not clear. I called Crostini and asked if the lot on the corner was acceptable.Question: Are you a patron of the this strip mall and if so, can I use this lot. Answer from the Crostini employee: No, but you would be. What does that even mean?  Are you getting me on a technicality of grammar?  Truthfully it would be much more efficient to just clearly state whether or not I could park there.

Now the food. I tried the meatball sub. It is $6.59. I am the kind of person who is willing to pay for good food. However, this is an astronomical price for a small (maybe 5 inch) sandwich with no side. This was a tasty meatball sandwich but it was nothing special. My husband ordered a panini and the portion was pretty tiny.

Sure, they give out free chocolate chip cookies but it does not make up for the lack of value on your food. I wanted to add something to my order but I assumed that my food would be up any minute. I sat there for about 25 minutes from ordering. They were not busy. One of the cooks was conversing with his friend about the weekend and whether he made it to Waterloo. Great, talk about your weekend but where is my food?

Skip Crostini and walk across the street to Dexter's. The wait is the same but the value is better. And the portions are much more generous."
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"Oh my goodness! How many places have you been to that give you a FREE cookie just because it's your first time visiting?? Crostini does!! 

Free cookie+bag of pickles+delicious sandwiches+good customer service= pretty great experience. 

OK. On to the sandwiches. I ordered the Farmer's Market. I have never experienced a sandwich with potato as the main part of it before. It was tasty and definitely filling. The sautéed peppers were also very yum! There were so many flavors wrapped into this sandwich. My husband ordered the Chicago Style Italian Beef. He enjoyed it, but it wasn't his favorite. 

We will definitely go back next time we want to have a picnic in downtown Madison!"
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,"I found this place via a google search for Italian Deli's in Madison last Friday and was very pleased with the results.  I had woke up that morning thinking about a good deli style Italian sandwich and this totally satisfied my craving.  While waiting for my sandwich I learned they also deliver within 5 miles and have Italian Beef sandwiches!  I move up here from Chicago 7 years ago and have been unsuccessfully looking for an authentic Italian Beef joint since.  So today, my fellow Chi-town transplants and I all ordered Italian Beef sandwiches and were really impressed.  This was not the typical Madison version Italian Beef sandwich (what we call French Dip in Chicago), but a real honest sloppy and savory Italian Beef.  If you live/work around the East Side of Madison and you haven't tried this place, you are missing out.  This has definitely been added to our short list of favorite lunch spots near work.

On a side note, one of my coworkers is gluten intolerant and found out that all of their stuff can be made gluten-free.  I think she was more excited than me :)"
Crostini Sandwiches,crostini's homemade egg salad sandwich,Delicious!  I got a chicken bacon avocado panini and it was really good. My husband got their house sub ( we can't remember the name) but it was really good too. It is a little pricy at 8 or 9 per sandwich but they use quality ingredients so it's definitely worth it.  Oh and we got complimentary chocolate chip cookies and those were delicious too! Definitely going back but probably only for carryout as there are only a few seats available.
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,Great food that mostly seems to be made in house. The prepackaged house salad was surprisingly delicious! Excellent customer service and a willingness to customize dishes. You can add seasonal veggies to the pastas and can get a homemade chocolate chip cookie all for free! Will definitely be returning. Not sure how I managed to miss this gem for a whole year.
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"I love crostini's food, I really do. Unfortunately, their customer service is lacking terribly. I have ordered about 10 times and half the time I usually end up with something wrong or missing. I let it go because the food is still good. 

Today, I couldn't answer the phone when they called because I was on the other line with a client, so I ran downstairs because I figured the call meant they were here. I waited at my front door for 10 minutes and no one came. 
A half hour later I called the shop asking if my food was on its way (it'd been 1 hr 15 min) and they told me the driver said I didn't answer my phone OR door. The driver never even came to my door, I was down there waiting for him. And to call once and leave it at that? Terrible customer service. It's now been an hour and 25 minutes that I've been waiting for ONE SANDWICH. 
Twice in the past the driver did not have change with him when he showed up for a delivery. They need to get themselves together or hire a new staff.

UPDATE: they ended up comping my food, so I upgraded the review to 3 stars."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"With a few exceptions, I've never met an owner of a local sandwich shop who takes so much pride in his work, and offers such outstanding customer service - not only from himself, but from his employees as well. Crostini wants you to have a great sandwich and a great experience ordering it, paying for it and, eventually, eating the glory that is their food. 
With that said, I have to say that everything on their menu is a testament to the management and ownership WANTING you to have a great meal; not just wanting to make a buck. To wit: I've trod nearly every item on their menu (they're in my neighborhood) and have had the experience of a few sub-excellent sandwiches. This isn't to say they were bad, but merely not amazing. 
The owner and staff recognize my face from so many visits and often ask me about how my last sandwich was. Being a former chef, I'm not too afraid to speak truth to their queries. On the rare occasion that something wasn't up to mine, and presumably their, incredibly high standards - they took my comments in stride and more often than not I would later find the item either removed from the menu or re-tooled into a culinary masterpiece of sandwich art that is their forte. 
With all that backstory aside, I just can't speak highly enough about their food. My go to sandwich, for when I just don't even want to think about what would taste amazing while satiating both myself and my wife, is the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. Its simplicity is sublime, its execution near flawless (maybe 1/3 less mayo and 1/2 more lettuce would help it reach nirvana). Spicy, but not unbearably so, it comes with an assortment of flavor profiles that meld into a thing of beauty. 
If you're looking for something more simple, and possibly more Chicagoan (you damn FIB), their various Italian beef incarnations are all equally perfect in their own special way. 
My cut and dried, highly compressed review of the place would be this:
""If your sandwich doesn't taste amazing, it's because you chose something you weren't in the mood for, not due to any issues with the recipes or a failure of a dutiful lack of execution.""
All in all, Crostini is a little miracle on North St. 
In a space once operated by Milio's; slanging bottom of the barrel meats and vegetables for an equivalent price - there now stands a shop so invested in your gastronomical pleasure that they offer free homemade (delicious) chocolate chip cookies to all comers, and, with the utmost sincerity, want you to become addicted to their food. 
I wish every person in the world the ability to dine on one truly delicious sandwich in their life. 
I'm proud to say that the location to achieve that aim in just two blocks from my house, on the near East-Side. 

Insiders aside: always ask about their specials. Yet another facet of this place that has never let me down, so long as it was something I was in the mood for."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"Food is great.  Customer service is one of the worst I have ever had!  I have ordered from them 3 times.  Each time I had a worse experience than the one before.  The first time, the order was about 15min. late, forgivable.  The second time, our order was over an hour late, no phone call to let me me know, Nothing.  The 2 times I called them, the response I got was ""the food was on it's way"".  Ok, shame on me for ordering from them again.  Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.  This time (today), food was an hour late and they forgot a sandwich.  I called and asked to speak to the manager, the response ""he's too busy!!""  I am still waiting for a phone call back.  Oh and the forgotten sandwich came 2.5 hours after it was suppose to be delivered!!

DO NOT EVER ORDER DELIVERY!!"
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,Waited over an hour for 2 sandwhiches and bowl of chili. Chili was warm at best and there was Mayo on the sandwich....got delivered 45 minutes after closing time so there is no one to complain to or to try and make it right.. Just an answering machine..WoW.
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"This sandwich shop is really great.  When you step in it's like going into one of those deli/sandwich places in a big city like NY or Chicago (I'm saying this from my own experience). It's cozy and there's a lot going on.  The prices are totally reasonable as well, you can get a lot of sandwiches for around $5 or less and they taste great!  I don't think most of the ingredients are local, organic or anything fancy like that but this is reflected in the low prices.  I've found a lot of sandwich/burger places charging $10+ for something made with the same quality ingredients. Also, a lot of their stuff is made in house (it's not just dumped from a Sysco freezer bag into the fryer) and tastes great.  A few sandwiches that I particularly like are the meatball sub, the tuna melt, and the Chicago hot dog.  Another great thing about Crostini's is that they deliver for a reasonable price (it's a $10 minimum and less than $2 delivery fee), so if you're feeling lazy or overwhelmed you can get your food brought to your door! All-in-all I highly recommend this place for a well-made tasty sandwich."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"I had pretty much been ignoring this place since it opened because I can't eat gluten, so I was assuming that sandwiches=glutenous bread. Last week my partner was all like, ""Ever been to this place?"" and I was all like, ""Um, I haven't been to a sandwich shop in years."" But he checked out the menu online and they had some gluten free options, so we decided to check it out. And I am so glad we did. Oh! You have no idea how wonderful it is to taste a damn good sandwich after years of eating bread that tastes like sand. I had the California Chicken panini. It was the stuff of dreams. Hot, gooey, cheesy, flavorful dreams. I am looking forward to our next visit!"
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"3.5 stars. Tasty sandwiches and specials. I've never had a problem finding a close parking spot. When they're cooking the spicy chicken I can't be in there (yes, it's that strong), but I always get my sandwich to go so not a problem."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"Great sandwich shop! Very accommodating of special food needs/requests. Wish there was a meal deal and better variety of sides, but the food is delicious and the prices are great otherwise."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"Worst service in Madison. We ordered online using grub pub, for delivery.  The order included one of their featured chicken sandwiches, two Chicago style hot dogs, one chili-mac, one potato and pasta salad.  The order took one hour and forty three minutes to arrive to the door, it was served by a delivery driver who was smoking a cigarette who appeared to have more people in the vehicle, the order was cold and incorrect.  I admit that delivery service in Madison slows down on a day that may have a few snow flurries, this day was no exception.  I do understand that when ordering on a day like this i may have to wait longer and that is perfectly fine, however, upon calling the restaurant and asking to speak with a manager, the man informed me that he was indeed the manager.  I then told him my food arrived cold and incorrect, and he told me that they could remake the order and it would be out to me in an hour and a half, for it takes one hour to prepare, and a half an hour to get to my door.  I expressed to the manager how long we had already been waiting to eat, and that we were not interested in waiting another hour and a half for the same cold food. The then told me that he could come back pick up the food and refund our money.  For all we wanted was to be full, we had began eating the cold food and this could not be an option. He then suggested that in the future if I want to order food that is delivered hot, I should order from a different restaurant with-in a block of my home.  Frustrated I told him that I would just write a review and I hung up the phone.  So here it is.  Ten minutes later, another ""manager"" called back concerning the order, he assured me that the next time i order it would be on them.  That's fine, however I don't think I'll be ordering from Crostini ever again, it should not take an hour to prepare a couple of hot dogs, a sandwich and a few sides.  Very disappointing, and to be told by one of their managers to just bring my business elsewhere if i want hot food, seems pretty ridiculous to me.  I also must admit I feel bad writing this review but it's simply the truth."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"I needed to grab something for lunch and feeling sick of the usual sandwich suspects of Subway and Milio's etc. I thought I would Yelp 'Sandwiches' near my work place. Crostini came up as 3 minutes away and had good ratings so I thought I would try it out. Together with two co workers we drove over there and were very impressed. We found street parking right across the street and the outdoor seating area looked nice. The daily special was listed on a chalkboard out front. Once inside there are seemingly endless delicious items to chose from on the menu boards. Finally, I opted for the Chicken pesto Panini and a Ceasar Salad along with the freshly brewed ice tea. My co workers order the Egg Salad Sandwich and Turkey Cran-Apple Chutney Panini and a chocolate malt. After a short wait one of the employees brought us our food to go. (I had read in the Yelp reviews some folks got a free cookie for their first visit, unfortunately, we didn't get one, either I failed to mention it was our first time or we weren't asked-oh well). 
At first I noticed there were no croutons on the ceasar salad and was momentarily disappointed, however, the parmesan on the salad made up for it as well as the awesome dressing and fresh lettuce as well as a hard boiled egg. I never ended up missing the croutons and think they would have been too filling and excessive.
My Panini was great. The portion size was very generous and there was no lack of gooey melted yummy cheese goodness. The chicken breast on the Panini was really good, flavorful and a nice cut of meet. The fresh avocado and spinach was tasty. My ice tea was also delicious, served with a fresh lemon slice (optional).
My co workers were also very impressed with their meals. 
We will be back!!!!!!!!!! And I will bring more customers."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"Best Chicago Italian Beef I have had outside Chicago. The owner recommended the Italian Beef. He was very friendly and helpful. The sandwich was perfectly crunchy and tasted fresh. Throw some fresh, homemade giardiniera on top and a free fresh baked cookie on the side. I'm sold."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,Absolutely delicious!!!! I had the California chicken sandwich and added red onions.  This is an amazing sandwich and I could eat this every day.  Their broccoli cheese soup is great!  Fast and friendly service.  I will definitely be going back here over and over and over
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"Get the Italian Beef. Amazing. I thought I'd had the best Italian Beef when Papa Coronofolous' was still open, but I was so wrong. When I opened the to-go box, my first reaction was to say. ""F**k yeah!"" This is a big sandwich with mozz and peppers (optional). And the price is not just reasonable, it's generous. Seriously, skip the chips, you won't finish them. But take the free cookie; they're awesome. Like a chocolate chip molasses cookie.

Crostini's may be a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but go a little out of the way. It's SO worth it."
Crostini Sandwiches,albacore tuna salad sandwich,"This is a tough one. The sandwiches are four-star, maybe five, but there were some bummers to the catering order I recently placed. Nothing horrendously wrong, by any means, but nothing that wowed me. A-OK describes my experience perfectly. 

+ You can place catering orders online through a popular Madison food delivery service. 
- There are no directions or details for catering orders; it lists the number of sandwich halves and cookies you'll get, but that's it. 
+ My delivery order arrived on time; I placed it three days before the event. 
- Despite putting detailed directions on how to find us (I was at a private party at a business), the driver couldn't find us and was wandering the apartment building next door. I was running an event in a basement-level business - if I hadn't had my phone or had reception I don't know if he'd had found us.
+ The sandwiches were delicious and came in a nice carrying case.
- The cookies had squared-off sides and looked to be mass produced. 
- There were no vegetarian options in the box even though they have a couple veggie subs on the menu. 
- There were no plates, napkins, or condiments; there was no mention of this, but for catering that's a pretty common inclusion. 

The most important thing, though, is the food, and the sandwiches got gobbled up in quick fashion. As a huge turkey sandwich fan, I can put my stamp on their version.

I do understand that when ordering on a day like this i may have to wait longer and that is perfectly fine, however, upon calling the restaurant and asking to speak with a manager, the man informed me that he was indeed the manager.  I then told him my food arrived cold and incorrect, and he told me that they could remake the order and it would be out to me in an hour and a half, for it takes one hour to prepare, and a half an hour to get to my door.  I expressed to the manager how long we had already been waiting to eat, and that we were not interested in waiting another hour and a half for the same cold food. The then told me that he could come back pick up the food and refund our money.  For all we wanted was to be full, we had began eating the cold food and this could not be an option. He then suggested that in the future if I want to order food that is delivered hot, I should order from a different restaurant with-in a block of my home.  Frustrated I told him that I would just write a review and I hung up the phone.  So here it is.  Ten minutes later, another ""manager"" called back concerning the order, he assured me that the next time i order it would be on them.  That's fine, however I don't think I'll be ordering from Crostini ever again, it should not take an hour to prepare a couple of hot dogs, a sandwich and a few sides.  Very disappointing, and to be told by one of their managers to just bring my business elsewhere if i want hot food, seems pretty ridiculous to me.  I also must admit I feel bad writing this review but it's simply the truth."
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"I needed to grab something for lunch and feeling sick of the usual sandwich suspects of Subway and Milio's etc. I thought I would Yelp 'Sandwiches' near my work place. Crostini came up as 3 minutes away and had good ratings so I thought I would try it out. Together with two co workers we drove over there and were very impressed. We found street parking right across the street and the outdoor seating area looked nice. The daily special was listed on a chalkboard out front. Once inside there are seemingly endless delicious items to chose from on the menu boards. Finally, I opted for the Chicken pesto Panini and a Ceasar Salad along with the freshly brewed ice tea. My co workers order the Egg Salad Sandwich and Turkey Cran-Apple Chutney Panini and a chocolate malt. After a short wait one of the employees brought us our food to go. (I had read in the Yelp reviews some folks got a free cookie for their first visit, unfortunately, we didn't get one, either I failed to mention it was our first time or we weren't asked-oh well). 
At first I noticed there were no croutons on the ceasar salad and was momentarily disappointed, however, the parmesan on the salad made up for it as well as the awesome dressing and fresh lettuce as well as a hard boiled egg. I never ended up missing the croutons and think they would have been too filling and excessive.
My Panini was great. The portion size was very generous and there was no lack of gooey melted yummy cheese goodness. The chicken breast on the Panini was really good, flavorful and a nice cut of meet. The fresh avocado and spinach was tasty. My ice tea was also delicious, served with a fresh lemon slice (optional).
My co workers were also very impressed with their meals. 
We will be back!!!!!!!!!! And I will bring more customers."
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"Best Chicago Italian Beef I have had outside Chicago. The owner recommended the Italian Beef. He was very friendly and helpful. The sandwich was perfectly crunchy and tasted fresh. Throw some fresh, homemade giardiniera on top and a free fresh baked cookie on the side. I'm sold."
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,Absolutely delicious!!!! I had the California chicken sandwich and added red onions.  This is an amazing sandwich and I could eat this every day.  Their broccoli cheese soup is great!  Fast and friendly service.  I will definitely be going back here over and over and over
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"Get the Italian Beef. Amazing. I thought I'd had the best Italian Beef when Papa Coronofolous' was still open, but I was so wrong. When I opened the to-go box, my first reaction was to say. ""F**k yeah!"" This is a big sandwich with mozz and peppers (optional). And the price is not just reasonable, it's generous. Seriously, skip the chips, you won't finish them. But take the free cookie; they're awesome. Like a chocolate chip molasses cookie.

Crostini's may be a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but go a little out of the way. It's SO worth it."
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"This is a tough one. The sandwiches are four-star, maybe five, but there were some bummers to the catering order I recently placed. Nothing horrendously wrong, by any means, but nothing that wowed me. A-OK describes my experience perfectly. 

+ You can place catering orders online through a popular Madison food delivery service. 
- There are no directions or details for catering orders; it lists the number of sandwich halves and cookies you'll get, but that's it. 
+ My delivery order arrived on time; I placed it three days before the event. 
- Despite putting detailed directions on how to find us (I was at a private party at a business), the driver couldn't find us and was wandering the apartment building next door. I was running an event in a basement-level business - if I hadn't had my phone or had reception I don't know if he'd had found us.
+ The sandwiches were delicious and came in a nice carrying case.
- The cookies had squared-off sides and looked to be mass produced. 
- There were no vegetarian options in the box even though they have a couple veggie subs on the menu. 
- There were no plates, napkins, or condiments; there was no mention of this, but for catering that's a pretty common inclusion. 

The most important thing, though, is the food, and the sandwiches got gobbled up in quick fashion. As a huge turkey sandwich fan, I can put my stamp on their version. It reminded me in one bite of the deli sandwiches I used to order when living out East. I had forgotten about these sandwiches entirely but their sauce/spices took me back. I will definitely order that sandwich again. It's nothing fancy, but I totally dug it. 

Looking forward to trying them in a non-catering capacity, and now that I've experienced their catering I know some handy facts for next time (such as trying to contact the store directly to inquire about including veg items in my order)."
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"Yes, it doesnt have a bathroom, easy parking, and huge sandwiches, but what they do have are sandwiches with quality ingredients and tons of flavor.  I had the crostini club sandwich and was happy with the all of flavors going on inside.  I'll be back for the italian beef shortly and I can't wait"
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"After hearing amazing things about Crostini, I was completely disappointed. Hype. That is all this place has. I was under the impression from the website and pictures it was a cafe of sorts. It was tables out front. 

Well it turns out, it is basically a counter place with a few tables available. The space is cramped and there are no public restrooms.  This would be nice to know. Please post a sign. Otherwise, your patrons will have to wait in line to ask for a bathroom and then find out there isn't one. That is pretty time consuming and annoying for goodness sake.  They then sent me to a neighboring business which had disgusting bathrooms. Not necessarily their fault but don't send your patrons to a dirty place because that still reflects on you.

Parking. Ugh. Not clear. I called Crostini and asked if the lot on the corner was acceptable.Question: Are you a patron of the this strip mall and if so, can I use this lot. Answer from the Crostini employee: No, but you would be. What does that even mean?  Are you getting me on a technicality of grammar?  Truthfully it would be much more efficient to just clearly state whether or not I could park there.

Now the food. I tried the meatball sub. It is $6.59. I am the kind of person who is willing to pay for good food. However, this is an astronomical price for a small (maybe 5 inch) sandwich with no side. This was a tasty meatball sandwich but it was nothing special. My husband ordered a panini and the portion was pretty tiny.

Sure, they give out free chocolate chip cookies but it does not make up for the lack of value on your food. I wanted to add something to my order but I assumed that my food would be up any minute. I sat there for about 25 minutes from ordering. They were not busy. One of the cooks was conversing with his friend about the weekend and whether he made it to Waterloo. Great, talk about your weekend but where is my food?

Skip Crostini and walk across the street to Dexter's. The wait is the same but the value is better. And the portions are much more generous."
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"Oh my goodness! How many places have you been to that give you a FREE cookie just because it's your first time visiting?? Crostini does!! 

Free cookie+bag of pickles+delicious sandwiches+good customer service= pretty great experience. 

OK. On to the sandwiches. I ordered the Farmer's Market. I have never experienced a sandwich with potato as the main part of it before. It was tasty and definitely filling. The sautéed peppers were also very yum! There were so many flavors wrapped into this sandwich. My husband ordered the Chicago Style Italian Beef. He enjoyed it, but it wasn't his favorite. 

We will definitely go back next time we want to have a picnic in downtown Madison!"
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"I found this place via a google search for Italian Deli's in Madison last Friday and was very pleased with the results.  I had woke up that morning thinking about a good deli style Italian sandwich and this totally satisfied my craving.  While waiting for my sandwich I learned they also deliver within 5 miles and have Italian Beef sandwiches!  I move up here from Chicago 7 years ago and have been unsuccessfully looking for an authentic Italian Beef joint since.  So today, my fellow Chi-town transplants and I all ordered Italian Beef sandwiches and were really impressed.  This was not the typical Madison version Italian Beef sandwich (what we call French Dip in Chicago), but a real honest sloppy and savory Italian Beef.  If you live/work around the East Side of Madison and you haven't tried this place, you are missing out.  This has definitely been added to our short list of favorite lunch spots near work.

On a side note, one of my coworkers is gluten intolerant and found out that all of their stuff can be made gluten-free.  I think she was more excited than me :)"
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,"Can't complain. This place is conveniently located near my house. This is our go-to place for our lazy nights when we are defiantly not cooking but are in need of a dinner that is not cereal.
They have a lot of Gluten free options delivery and pickup. They have a punch card that when you fill it up you get $5.00 off. 
My Husband loves their cheesesteaks and we are transplants from Philly so I think that's saying something. I usually get the spicy chicken with not bacon and no cheese becasue I am no fun :oP
this is a great place to have in the hood and many nights i'd go hungry without them."
Crostini Sandwiches,spicy chicken sandwich,Delicious!  I got a chicken bacon avocado panini and it was really good. My husband got their house sub ( we can't remember the name) but it was really good too. It is a little pricy at 8 or 9 per sandwich but they use quality ingredients so it's definitely worth it.  Oh and we got complimentary chocolate chip cookies and those were delicious too! Definitely going back but probably only for carryout as there are only a few seats available.
Chang Jiang,c6. roast pork with chinese vegetables combination plate,"I like this restaurant mostly because they really aim to please.  I called wanting vegetarian soup, which isn't available at most Chinese restaurants or as a matter of fact at Chang Jiang, but they offered to make it for me.  It was really tasty and the vegetables weren't overcooked at all.  I've tried various dishes there and ordered my own creations, but the eggplant has been my favorite so far with broccoli with garlic sauce a close second.  

It's really cheap, and there is free hot tea to have while waiting for to go orders.  I'm lucky that I live so close to it."
Chang Jiang,c6. roast pork with chinese vegetables combination plate,"Pleasantly surprised.
One of the only places in town that offer cold sesame noodles.
Their 'House Special' soup was impressive; similar to a 'sizzling rice soup' without the rice.
High quality take out containers; easy to wash and re-use.
Asked for crispy vegetables in two dishes; both were perfect.
Only downside: Hot and Sour soup was bland.
Definitely order again."
Chang Jiang,c6. roast pork with chinese vegetables combination plate,"I grabbed a quick lunch here and I was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the hot and spicy beef with hot and sour soup. The portion was absolutely huge! The soup was not a full, standard size cup, but still more than enough with the rest of the meal.

The meat had was cooked well and the vegetables were plentiful - although the big pieces of green pepper threw me a bit - but this seems to be a common element of most styles of this dish. There also was a note of ginger that was really awesome! 

The spice level of both dishes (soup and beef) could have been better - it was very mild for being listed as ""spicy."" 

The real standout was the fried rice that came with. This dish was not a mere afterthought and actually had flavor, peas, and carrots - it was good! 

I would definitely be willing to try more of the menu once I finish my leftovers of course."
Chang Jiang,c6. roast pork with chinese vegetables combination plate,"For a Chinese take-out place, Chang Jiang is awesome. I prefaced with ""Chinese take-out"" because that is very different from authentic Chinese restaurant. So, put your expectations in place before ordering is my suggestion!

They give huge portions. I swear my take-out bag is always many many pounds heavy. I've had the House Mei Fun twice now. Its flavor is pretty yummy. It's not overwhelmingly oily like most take-out places. I've also had the Eggplant with Eggplant Sauce (Yo, I heard you like eggplant amirite?). I'm guessing the eggplant sauce means the sauce in which eggplant is cooked, which is like a garlic sauce. Otherwise, I'll be impressed if the sauce were made from eggplants. The eggplants themselves lacked a bit of flavor, but I enjoyed it anyway. I highly recommend the Kung Pao Chicken. The chicken is breaded and it actually tastes like chicken, unlike chicken from other take-out places. 

Side story... I ordered on Eat Street last week, and it was my first time ordering at Chang Jiang. I totally skipped over the tip portion and felt awful about it. So, fortunately the food was good, because before we picked up the food, we had already decided to go a second time the next day to tip extra since we forgot!"
Chang Jiang,c6. roast pork with chinese vegetables combination plate,"I ordered Fried Rice, Crab Rangoon and Crispy Seaseme Chicken.  I enjoyed all of the food.  I really liked that the chicken was crispy.  I don't like when chicken gets soggy from sauce and loses the skin.  I got a free pint of pork fried rice because my order was over $15.  I definitely have enough food to feed me for a week and the price was great.  The major downside was it took over an hour to get delivered.  Have to remember to order early so I'm not eating at 730 at night!"

Hot & Sour Soup: Rockin - but FYI has shrimp in it for those allergic to shellfish.

Fried Dumplings: Pretty good. Dipping sauce doesn't have enough ginger or sesame. 

Spicy Happy Family: Meh. Not spicy, even after requesting spicy, and just not very flavorful. 

Singapore Me Fun: Meh. Bland but for chili flake.

All in all, doubtful we will order again, unless just for soup, and make my own dipping sauce, or tweak theirs for the dumplings."

Super dissatisfied with this. Never ordering from them again!"
Happy Wok,family size hot spicy chicken,Have been going here for years and they never disappoint. They are easily the cheapest Chinese place in town and continue to produce quality food.

Happy Wok,family size hot spicy chicken,Solidly good American style Chinese in Monona. Ordered in person and the service was super fast. Asked for hot mustard packets and got zero though. Hot and sour soup is lacking flavor and meat. However spicy chicken and honey chicken were both very solid options. So in summary hot and fast with minor order issues and skip the soup. Solidly better than options on Monona drive.

The lo mein had no taste.  The fried rice was so dry i had to take a drink mid chew to be able to get it down my throat. The crab rangoon was so greasy that it left a coating in our mouths. It was all a waste since we just threw it out and ordered a pizza.  never again."

The portions are perfect size especially for the price. Definitely recommend for a comfy night in!
Happy Wok,family size hot spicy shrimp peking style,Have been going here for years and they never disappoint. They are easily the cheapest Chinese place in town and continue to produce quality food. The dining area atmosphere is more of a fast food style but the price and speed make up for that. The family that run the place are very nice and will make a dish however you ask.
Happy Wok,family size hot spicy shrimp peking style,Solidly good American style Chinese in Monona. Ordered in person and the service was super fast. Asked for hot mustard packets and got zero though. Hot and sour soup is lacking flavor and meat. However spicy chicken and honey chicken were both very solid options. So in summary hot and fast with minor order issues and skip the soup. Solidly better than options on Monona drive.
Happy Wok,family size hot spicy shrimp peking style,"I wish I could give this place no stars.  The food was enedible.  First, all of our food was the same ugly color brown.  Second, the General Tso's chicken was waaaaay too spicy.  My husband who loves spicy food couldn't even eat it.  The Sesame chicken was so sour that no one wanted to eat it.  The lo mein had no taste.  The fried rice was so dry i had to take a drink mid chew to be able to get it down my throat. The crab rangoon was so greasy that it left a coating in our mouths. It was all a waste since we just threw it out and ordered a pizza.  never again."
Happy Wok,family size hot spicy shrimp peking style,"Don't judge it by the outside... Or the inside for that matter. Looks like most quick lame tasting Chinese restaurants... But the food is really good! I got the triple delight, which had large shrimp, lots of chicken and good flavor and ample quantity (enough i couldnt eat it all!) The hot and sour soup is really how I judge a Chinese restaurant, and there's had a great flavor."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"We have ordered from Burrito Drive a few times out of drunken desperation and today we ordered sober for the first time. It was delivery for me to have a tasty lunch at work. Two words: Never. Again. We ordered the sheh-meh-neh burrito and Enchiladas. The first not so obvious issue was the addition of shrimp to our enchilada. This might be an excellent bonus if I weren't deathly allergic to shrimp. My throat nearly shut off completely. Thanks guys. Secondly, the sauce on the enchilada smelled and tasted like marina pasta sauce. Just stick to what you know best, guys. Mediocre, soggy, non-fresh tasteless burritos. I have a suspicion the burritos are prepared days if not weeks in advanced and then microwaved. Just DRIVE RIGHT PAST BURRITO DRIVE & spare your wallet and health..."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"Walk into Burrito Drive at 2:30am. Go up to the register and be greeted by a nice gentleman. Ask what they are known for. You order. Chips come to the table with hottt Salsa. Yes! The Sheh-meh-neh burrito comes out within less 7 min. It's huge but  you devour it. Sweet potato purée, grilled chicken, pickled red onion, bacon!, quest fresco. You leave at 3am when they close mostly sobered up. I call that a success."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"Alright, I thought Burrito Drive was always more potential than actual deliciousness the first few times I ordered; that was probably because I tried to make my own burrito, which was fine. I also got some chorizo tacos once, which were also fine.

Then I finally decided to order a burrito off the menu, and let me describe the beauty that is the Sheh-neh-meh burrito. It's worth any humiliation you may incur in saying its name out loud earnestly. 

The combination of an especially delicious and smoky version of bacon (Neuske's) with the sweet potato puree, plus the charred grilled chicken, plus the salty cheese, PLUS the acidity of the rare bite of pickled onion, is a pretty spectacular melding of flavors. It just works out perfectly. Every taste bud is working, but in a complementary way. 

If you're missing spice just add some salsa to the dryish swaths of white rice that inevitably appear. I even added diced tomato and cilantro (for free) to add another layer of flavor and it honestly wasn't overkill. I can't endorse this burrito enough. 

So no, Burrito Drive isn't the greatest Mexican place, and I probably would go/order from a more authentic place if I wanted a full Mexican meal. But, they have the unique ingredients of bacon and sweet potato (and also great Mexican cheeses), and they know how to use them. So take advantage as long as you're here."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"I've been ordering from these guys for almost a year. This is probably one of the best burrito places I've ever eaten at. The Sheh-meh-neh burrito is UNBELIEVABLE! Delicious tender succulent marinated chicken, with some red onions, topped with a thin layer of sweet potato puree!

It's that wonderful euphoric delight where both salty and sweet collide and form a paradise in your mouth...like a chocolate covered pretzel...or pigs in a blanket! I love this place and order from it so much, they knew me by name...kinda embarrassing but awesome at the same time.

If you're looking for a late night snack or just a mid-day fill up, I highly recommend Burrito Drive."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"One of the only delivery places in downtown Madison that's open late night.
Perfect for when I'm out with my friends and the line for Jins Chicken is too long and even better for a lazy night in.
The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty incredible.
Count me in anytime for Burrito Drive"
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"I am now updating my review of Burrito Drive, as they seemed to have improved their ability to deliver the items purchased. In fact, their delivery service now seems pretty fast, and the food is better. The grilled chicken has a delicious char, the local bacon is caramelized and rich, and the burritos seem better composed than they once were.  Their guacamole is also wonderful, if a little overpriced.

I stand by my previous statement regarding their so called ""Golden Rod Tres Leches,""  which is an atrocity against mankind, composed of three frozen twinkies swimming in melted whipped cream and condensed milk.  Stick to the burritos."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"The specials of Burrito Drive are (you guessed it) burritos! They serve up some interesting variations on this Mexican staple, my favorite being the She-meh-neh burrito. This combination of chicken, bacon, sweet potato filling, rice, cheese, and onions fulfill the sweet, savory, and umami flavors that make me crave food from here more often than I like to admit.

They have good tasting meat here, which is something I consider very important while grading any restaurant. It's succulent and charred meat has been much more of a hit than a miss for the many times I've ordered from here. 

This is one of my main go-tos for delicious and unique food in Madison."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"I've eaten their food so many times in the past few years I've lost count. Not everything is perfect (chicken wings are the only ones that come to mind), but most everything I've had I enjoyed. Chicken enchiladas? Thirty times enjoyed. Classic tacos? Yup. They cost an extra buck or two but its worth it."
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"I don't know why it took me so long to try Burrito drive!  I ordered delivery for the first time last week.  It was recommended to me by friends to try the Grilled Chicken Burrito.  I also looked through their menu and couldn't resist the sweet potato Quesadilla.  It was a good choice. It was AWESOME.  Those caramelized onions in with the sweet potatoes and the dipping sauce made it perfection.
The delivery was quick and the driver was very nice.  I always happen to be just outside of the delivery area of other places on Willy/Atwood, but I was excited that they have a larger delivery area.
The Chicken Burrito was good, I wished that the salsa was in the burrito and not on the side.  The flavor of the chicken was really good.  I was very pleased and I'm sure will be ordering again in the near future!"
Burrito Drive,chicken enchilada,"First time at Burrito Drive, and was skeptical, being raised in Texas and growing up on authentic Mexican food. I ordered the 3 taco plate with carne asada, on flour tortillas. Blown away! It was good. I was a very happy customer! They use fresh ingredients and combine ingredients the way real TexMex is done. Fresh guacamole, (not the fake, bright green stuff you get at other places), Perfect cheese, too. The tortillas were good, but I prefer mine a lot thicker and fluffy. Never the less, it was money well spent. These days, if I'm going to part with my hard earned money, I darn better be satisfied. Burrito Drive made me more than wiling to do this, and I plan on making the 80 mile round trip again, for sure. Well worth it. 

I brought home chicken enchiladas for my son. Even after reheating it, he said to report that it was great! 

It's a small place, easy to miss, unless you're looking for it. That made it all the more good since everyone in our party of 4 knows what wonderful food lies in those small, hole-in-the-wall places in the communities of South Texas. 

I would recommend this place to everyone, but especially those in Madison area who get what I mean when I say ""real"" TexMex.

Burrito Drive,chicken quesadilla,So bad!! I had the yuckiest sweet potato quesadilla. Couldn't eat more than two bites. I won't give it another try.
Burrito Drive,chicken quesadilla,"The food is good. Delivery fast. But I can't believe I paid $18 with tip for a steak quesadilla with almost no fillings at all, the missing green peppers I ordered as an extra and the tiny container of guacamole.  My hopes were high for a filling meal. Not so much.  Everything tasted good but it was way over priced. I just think that if you pay $10+ for a quesadilla it should include more than a few pieces of meat and a sprinkle of cheese, you know?
Not sure if I'll try again."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"This is the most delicious non-Mexican Mexican food I've had in Madison. Is it fine dining wrapped in normcore clothes? Small business fast-casual with Midwestern pragmatism? *shrugs*

Our guy behind the counter rec'd the Sheh-meh-neh burrito, which was on point, who knew sweet potato mash goes good in burritos, but I was rightfully suspicious of his red sauce rec bc I know my body and my body likes green sauce so that's what I went with. Holy chicken it was delicious. 

Carnitas tacos were also nothing to mess with and they came in an easy to deliver box (we ordered to go). The meat bits were crispy and tender with a little hint of sweet, tasty good with green sauce and slaw. 

The interior is kind of damp and drab, but I suppose they provide tables and chairs out of courtesy. Most of their business seems to run on delivery or takeout. 

*this review was written while completely sober."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"Not your typical Mexican restaurant - if you're looking for authentic this is not the place for you... However, Burrito Drive has always been one of my favorite places to eat in Madison, delivery or otherwise! The big, rich burritos will satisfy your hunger and then some. Something for everyone! I especially recommend the Hungry Hippie burrito with pork.

I think people who have given a bad review have either tried to make their own burrito or ordered something that is NOT a burrito off the menu... I'd say if you're looking for a twist on the classic burrito, get one of their classic items and you will not be disappointed. Don't listen to the bad reviews, this place is more than worth a try."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,Great twist on the usual Mexican fare in Madison.  Who knew sweet potato purée would be so awesome in a burrito??  Mexican food delivered to work-awesome!!
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"I have found my 'Vetos' of Madison!!!!! (If you don't know what I'm talking about reference down to my review of Vetos (;)

So happy when my roommates brought me here, and when I learned that they deliver! And they serve beer :)

Definitely a place to hit up after the bar from some good Drunk People Food. My roommates ended up getting the steak quesidilla, tater tots, and the chips and cheese (Which is just tortilla chips and a cup of cheese) and their friend got the Fish Tacos, I on the other hand got possibly the best tasting thing ever at 2am The Hungry Hippie Burrito. So good, yet so messy! It had Rice, tater tots, guac, and Mexican salw I believe it was. I got a side of Sour Cream, and their Red Salsa with it. It paired perfectly while watching Family Guy on the TV (You never can go wrong with Family Guy while eating a burrito, drunk.) 

I only finish about a 4th of it due to it being so big, but bagged up the left overs, and was on our way."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,Im a big guy....And i love healthy portions of food.  Well this place does not disapoint!  The burritos are so good.  I think i downed like 6 of them.  The staff was very friendly and the place is really clean.  I just wish they would give you a bigger portion of Mexican rice!
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"Like many, I seem to only visit Burrito Drive when I'm out on the town visit local bars. Any quick Mexican food is going to be a winner in my book, and I like the salsa varieties that Burrito Drive offers (pico, medium red, medium green, hot red). Their use of sweet potato puree in a few of their burritos is fantastic, and the ShehMehNeh is definitely a favorite.

A few low points: there are no nachos on the menu and this KILLS me. The closest you can get is a basket of chips and salsa or chips and guacamole. Big bummer.

Delivery can be tricky. A few years ago I had an unfortunate incident where I had paid by credit card for my delivery order online. Upon receiving my order, I was asked for payment. Assuming something hadn't worked with my card I paid cash and later realized my card was also charged. I called the store the next day, and played phone tag with the manager multiple times about the issue without resolution. I eventually gave up, and now have a good story about paying $25 for a burrito. Lesson learned..."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"Looking for authentic Mexican food? Then this is the place... that you should not order from.  But! I still love Burrito Drive because it is fast and easy.  Usually I just create my own burrito, but if you're feeling sleezy, you can always try the White Trash Burrito, which features American delicacies such as Spam and Velveeta."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"I am glad you exist Burrito Drive. You fill a much needed space in the food service here. LATE night and hang over food. Thank you for the hungry hippy. Also the Breakfast Burrito is so so so delicious, excellent addition. 

XX This is not a sit down, bring your family Mexican restaurant if that is what you are looking for."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"It's a really good place. They have amazing, innovative ideas like ""white trash"" burritos and whatnot. It sortof reminds me of Ian's pizza but..for Mexican food. They offer pretty decent delivery(a little slow but you get it). I really recommend their cheese enchiladas..as far as those go - really good. I'm not as much of a fan of their sides(rice&beans) as I've been at other places and the prices are fair."

Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"Went for late night burritos. The food was fresh and the burrito was packed full of great ingredients. The Mexican corn, when in season, is a must try for everyone. If your looking for late night eats this is among the top 3 for me."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"In a word, too expensive.

The food is creative and fun, but it's not at a price point that most of the people who would be interested in this place are at.  Their chips and salsa is pure highway robbery too.  They charge $5.75 for it and must make about $4.00 per order.  My burrito (the Sheh-Meh-Neh) was actually pretty good, but there was something in it that tasted off.  It could have just been that one burrito, but I couldn't finish it---and that's not because it's a decent-sized burrito.  I ended up spending close to $16 on a burrito and chips, and I admit that the shock I felt then (I didn't realize the chips were so expensive) is infecting this review.  It may, in fact, be ""New Mexican Food"" but it's priced for the Nouveau Riche.

I would try other items on their menu, but I would much rather spend $10 elsewhere.  Perhaps some night when I'm hammered and money is flowing out of my pocket as fast as alcohol is pouring into my liver.  Until then, Adios."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"Good food for Anglicized Mexican. Only order the tacos for delivery if you have access to a microwave as they'll probably not stay warm on the journey. Still, despite that, enjoyed the food more than I thought I would and delivery time was more than reasonable for the time I ordered it. Overall, a little pricey, but taste wise it's worth it. Would still recommend saving yourself a few dollars and order for carryout instead of delivery."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"My go to place for  takeout Mexican.  Chorizo tacos are on point, as well as the chimichangas and enchiladas.  Can't beat the prices either."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"When I lived in Madison about six years ago, Burrito Drive had only been around a short time.  I used to order delivery from them all the time.  Since then I've moved away, but I found myself in Madison recently with a late-night craving.  After all these years, could Burrito Drive still stack up?

The answer is a resounding yes.  I ordered three tacos with corn tortillas, roasted zucchini, asadero cheese, and cranberry salsa.  They were delicious.  

I was with some friends, and we also received some free chips and salsa for while we waited for our food to arrive.

Also, is it just me, or did the interior of this place get quite a bit nicer?  Maybe my recollection is off. 

Anyway, great experience at a classic Madison establishment.  Is it the most ""authentic"" food created by someone's Mexican grandmother?  No.  Is it delicious, creative, high-quality and inexpensive?  Yes!  I hope Burrito Drive sticks around for many more years."
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"Yum yum yum...
Got this delivered last night... While it may have been the most I have spent on delivery ($35), it was good food, especially considering it is fast and cheesy, greasy Mexican fare.
I got the cheese enchiladas and while they bordered on being too cheesy, I finished them quickly! They were really good.  My man got the burrito.  I don't remember what it was called but it was huge and packed with beef and he really enjoyed it.  We also got chips and dip and the bean dip stuff was really good, just wish we would've gotten more.  They also have really good guac and pico.
I will definately be ordering from here again!"
Burrito Drive,mexican slaw,"Burrito Drive, I've been there once and loved it.  Its just off of Willy Street on Brearly, not the best location in the world and I fear it will get overlooked for that reason.  Regardless they're food is great.  Its not authentic Mexican, but it doesn't pretend to be - this is new Mexican food in all its glorious well combined tastiness.  I had a sweet potato burrito that was phenomenal.  They serve beer as well and have a nice little dining room.  You gotta check out Burrito Drive when you get a chance, maybe next time you're doing laundry since the laundromat is right next door."

Burrito Drive made me more than wiling to do this, and I plan on making the 80 mile round trip again, for sure. Well worth it. 

I brought home chicken enchiladas for my son. Even after reheating it, he said to report that it was great! 

It's a small place, easy to miss, unless you're looking for it. That made it all the more good since everyone in our party of 4 knows what wonderful food lies in those small, hole-in-the-wall places in the communities of South Texas. 

I would recommend this place to everyone, but especially those in Madison area who get what I mean when I say ""real"" TexMex. 

Shout out to the awesome staff, too. Nice vibe to go with good food."

The Sheh-meh-neh burrito is UNBELIEVABLE! Delicious tender succulent marinated chicken, with some red onions, topped with a thin layer of sweet potato puree!

It's that wonderful euphoric delight where both salty and sweet collide and form a paradise in your mouth...like a chocolate covered pretzel...or pigs in a blanket! I love this place and order from it so much, they knew me by name...kinda embarrassing but awesome at the same time.

If you're looking for a late night snack or just a mid-day fill up, I highly recommend Burrito Drive."
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,"One of the only delivery places in downtown Madison that's open late night.
Perfect for when I'm out with my friends and the line for Jins Chicken is too long and even better for a lazy night in.
The prices are reasonable and the food is pretty incredible.
Count me in anytime for Burrito Drive"
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,"I am now updating my review of Burrito Drive, as they seemed to have improved their ability to deliver the items purchased. In fact, their delivery service now seems pretty fast, and the food is better. The grilled chicken has a delicious char, the local bacon is caramelized and rich, and the burritos seem better composed than they once were.  Their guacamole is also wonderful, if a little overpriced.

I stand by my previous statement regarding their so called ""Golden Rod Tres Leches,""  which is an atrocity against mankind, composed of three frozen twinkies swimming in melted whipped cream and condensed milk.  Stick to the burritos."
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,"The specials of Burrito Drive are (you guessed it) burritos! They serve up some interesting variations on this Mexican staple, my favorite being the She-meh-neh burrito. This combination of chicken, bacon, sweet potato filling, rice, cheese, and onions fulfill the sweet, savory, and umami flavors that make me crave food from here more often than I like to admit.

They have good tasting meat here, which is something I consider very important while grading any restaurant. It's succulent and charred meat has been much more of a hit than a miss for the many times I've ordered from here. 

This is one of my main go-tos for delicious and unique food in Madison."
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,"I've eaten their food so many times in the past few years I've lost count. Not everything is perfect (chicken wings are the only ones that come to mind), but most everything I've had I enjoyed. Chicken enchiladas? Thirty times enjoyed. Classic tacos? Yup. They cost an extra buck or two but its worth it."
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,"I don't know why it took me so long to try Burrito drive!  I ordered delivery for the first time last week.  It was recommended to me by friends to try the Grilled Chicken Burrito.  I also looked through their menu and couldn't resist the sweet potato Quesadilla.  It was a good choice. It was AWESOME.  Those caramelized onions in with the sweet potatoes and the dipping sauce made it perfection.
The delivery was quick and the driver was very nice.  I always happen to be just outside of the delivery area of other places on Willy/Atwood, but I was excited that they have a larger delivery area.
The Chicken Burrito was good, I wished that the salsa was in the burrito and not on the side.  The flavor of the chicken was really good.  I was very pleased and I'm sure will be ordering again in the near future!"
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,"First time at Burrito Drive, and was skeptical, being raised in Texas and growing up on authentic Mexican food. I ordered the 3 taco plate with carne asada, on flour tortillas. Blown away! It was good. I was a very happy customer! They use fresh ingredients and combine ingredients the way real TexMex is done. Fresh guacamole, (not the fake, bright green stuff you get at other places), Perfect cheese, too. The tortillas were good, but I prefer mine a lot thicker and fluffy. Never the less, it was money well spent. These days, if I'm going to part with my hard earned money, I darn better be satisfied. Burrito Drive made me more than wiling to do this, and I plan on making the 80 mile round trip again, for sure. Well worth it. 

I brought home chicken enchiladas for my son. Even after reheating it, he said to report that it was great! 

It's a small place, easy to miss, unless you're looking for it. That made it all the more good since everyone in our party of 4 knows what wonderful food lies in those small, hole-in-the-wall places in the communities of South Texas. 

I would recommend this place to everyone, but especially those in Madison area who get what I mean when I say ""real"" TexMex. 

Shout out to the awesome staff, too. Nice vibe to go with good food."
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,So bad!! I had the yuckiest sweet potato quesadilla. Couldn't eat more than two bites. I won't give it another try.
Burrito Drive,adobo chicken quesadilla,"The food is good. Delivery fast. But I can't believe I paid $18 with tip for a steak quesadilla with almost no fillings at all, the missing green peppers I ordered as an extra and the tiny container of guacamole.  My hopes were high for a filling meal. Not so much.  Everything tasted good but it was way over priced. I just think that if you pay $10+ for a quesadilla it should include more than a few pieces of meat and a sprinkle of cheese, you know?
Not sure if I'll try again."
Burrito Drive,grilled chicken burrito,"Walk into Burrito Drive at 2:30am. Go up to the register and be greeted by a nice gentleman. Ask what they are known for. You order. Chips come to the table with hottt Salsa. Yes! The Sheh-meh-neh burrito comes out within less 7 min. It's huge but  you devour it. Sweet potato purée, grilled chicken, pickled red onion, bacon!, quest fresco. You leave at 3am when they close mostly sobered up. I call that a success."
Burrito Drive,grilled chicken burrito,"Alright, I thought Burrito Drive was always more potential than actual deliciousness the first few times I ordered; that was probably because I tried to make my own burrito, which was fine. I also got some chorizo tacos once, which were also fine.

Then I finally decided to order a burrito off the menu, and let me describe the beauty that is the Sheh-neh-meh burrito. It's worth any humiliation you may incur in saying its name out loud earnestly. 

The combination of an especially delicious and smoky version of bacon (Neuske's) with the sweet potato puree, plus the charred grilled chicken, plus the salty cheese, PLUS the acidity of the rare bite of pickled onion, is a pretty spectacular melding of flavors. It just works out perfectly. Every taste bud is working, but in a complementary way. 

If you're missing spice just add some salsa to the dryish swaths of white rice that inevitably appear. I even added diced tomato and cilantro (for free) to add another layer of flavor and it honestly wasn't overkill. I can't endorse this burrito enough. 

So no, Burrito Drive isn't the greatest Mexican place, and I probably would go/order from a more authentic place if I wanted a full Mexican meal. But, they have the unique ingredients of bacon and sweet potato (and also great Mexican cheeses), and they know how to use them. So take advantage as long as you're here."

Burrito Drive,adobo chicken burrito,"Last night was my second experience with Burrito Drive and I'm officially a fan. I ordered the steak quesadilla (with a side of guacamole) and my husband got the adobo chicken burrito. He really enjoyed his burrito (it was plenty good, I snuck a bite), but once he tried my steak quesadilla, that was it. He said: Oh man, I'm ordering that next time. And I totally get why. Because, um yeah............it was awesome!

The tortilla was crispy & warm & a little buttery. And the steak was SO tender and flavorful and delicious. Then there's the Asadero cheese, which is perfection - just the right combination of creamy and salty. Their red salsa is great, with just the right amount of smokiness & spice. And the guac - you guys! The guacamole is definitely worth the extra $$$. Definitely. The only aside were the tater tots which were underwhelming. They were lukewarm and no longer crispy by the time I got our order home, but I can't allow that to tarnish our positive experiences. Tots just don't hold/travel well, even when it's just a short distance.

Their portions are exceptionally sized and we have yet to be disappointed. We will be back. And we'll both get the steak quesadilla and you'll be sad you don't have one. It's just that good. Go on...... Give it a try.  :o)"

Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"El Jalapeno is a great upgrade from the previous establishment and I'm glad to see another very good authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Prices are completely reasonable, salsa is quite tasty, and the food is right on par with Taqueria Guadalajara in my opinion.

What's really surprising is that this isn't a hole in the wall once you actually walk into the place despite how the former establishment was and how the outside of complex looks.  They have some TVs, a colorful atmosphere, a good amount of seating, and very friendly staff.

Their gorditas are the go-to favorite for both my wife and I, and their tacos and chimichangas are also top notch.

Madison is very hit or miss with Mexican from what I've experienced (and I've tried a decent amount of places on both sides of town), so make sure to get to El Jalapeno if you're a fan of food from south of the border.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's right on par with the best of Madison."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"The tamales were tasty and the service was great. My server, Angelica, was very friendly and helpful. I went here for lunch. The food was fresh, came out quickly, and was a good value. It was nice to have some authentic Mexican food this far from my home in Colorado, where I've gotten spoiled with its abundance."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"I'm sitting here three hours after lunch still in a satiated daze with a belly full of carnitas (a special available only on weekends)...  To my own detriment, perhaps, I tend to avoid Mexican restaurants that have goofy caricatures wearing sombreros and hoisting a burrito or a margarita as their logo (and what is this thing anyway?  A jalapeño?  Looks like an avocado...) but this place is the real deal.  With apologies to my other favorite west-side Mexican place (Tienda Los Gemelos), I think this place is a little bit better, and definitely has a more extensive menu. Service is always friendly but like a lot of Mexican restaurants don't wait around for your check-- just head up to the register when you are done.

Everybody always comments on the chips and salsa(s) when they rate these kinds of places so  here goes-- chips have been hit or miss but today we got a huge basket of warm, crispy chips with nice, fresh, salsa.  There was a squeeze bottle of some much hotter salsa on the table that I had with the carnitas."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"This place is pretty tasty. We started with cheese sauce and guacamole. The guacamole was made to order, it was so creamy and good. The chips are fried fresh so super tasty.

He had carnitas and they were flavorful and good. I had chicken flautas (no lettuce) and they were fried to perfection. We also tried one steak taco with just cheese. The steak was super flavorful and if I would have known it was that good I would have ordered more tacos.

Try this place. You won't be disappointed."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Ok let me preface this by stating that I've only eaten the inexpensive tacos there and they are yummy and awesome especially for the price! Around $2 for each Taco so a couple of them make for a good light meal along with the complimentary chips n salsa. Very warm and competent staff that takes great care of you.
   Perhaps I will try other menu items and report back but for now I'll stick to my favs. I always get excited when I know I'm going there and leave the place all warm and fuzzy. Not too many places like that anymore!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"I don't get the negative reviews this place is getting.  I've been on a ""taco quest"" lately and this is so far my fave joint in Madtown.  The tortillas are fresh, warm, fluffy, obviously made right there, as they should be.  I've been three times so far and tried a lot of the fillings, and they have all been flavorful, filling but not gut-bombs, and satisfying.  I even like the refried beans, which is usually a throw-away add-on to a plate.

A lot of the other taco places around here either seem to serve dried-out tortillas, and rubbery store-bought ones.  And I hate it when they glop a ton of sloppy filling into a tortilla so it falls apart.  El Jalapeno totally avoids that trap.  I will definitely be back many times to try more tacos, and explore the non-taco side of their menu.

Plus the people are so friendly, and the space is cozy and inviting, it just makes me and my wife happy to be there.  Totally recommend without reservation!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,Best tacos in Madison hands down! Excellent service. Hand made carved booths from Jalisco.
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Was a little skeptical based on other reviews, but decided to give it a try for our lazy Sunday meal.

Ordered combo and chicken tacos and the 2 chimi meal

Food was great, delivered warm. 

Was able to track our delivery. Will definitely utilize this service again for this place!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"I lived on the Mexican border of Texas in my childhood. My parents took us into Mexico often. We had a Mexican-American live-in housekeeper who cooked for us... so, I know MY food, both Tex-Mex and Mexican. 

El Jalapeño is the ""real deal."" Living in Nakoma, a few blocks away, we've been there since it opened and returned time and again. The owners are from Jalisco, the seating made of hand-crafted Jalisco painted wood, complimented by original oil paintings. The lighting is bright... as is customary in Mexico!

The food is fantastic. There are many on here who complain about this or that (mainly, it seems, the salsa that comes with the chips.) Why so much focus on the salsa?! The chips are home-made, fresh and hot. Ask for another salsa (a hotter, richer flavored one, as we did) and move on! 

The food is what this place is about and it is DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC. This is much, much more than a 'tacos joint.' In fact, the 'Carne Asado' entree platter at 
$ 10.99 is a steal. Thin slices of flank steak, perfectly grilled accompany fresh, hot corn tortillas, along with cactus leaf (delicious,) a chopped Mexican lettuce salad, rice and beans. No lard or trans fat, so the latter two were light and flavorful. The platter was huge, almost enough for two.

I love their 'Enchiladas Platter' also. You can choose the filling: steak, pork, chicken, etc. and they are perfectly cooked and yummy.

We've had most everything on the menu. There is nothing I wouldn't order again, the food is that good.... and so very, very reasonable for the quality. Most dinner or lunch entrees are $ 7.99.  Service is friendly, delightful and unobtrusive. One pays at the cash register (as in Mexico,) when one is ready to leave. We love that!

By the way, the local Mexican-American population has discovered El Jalapeño. It is packed with families and others, which is the best sign that this place is authentic and just like ""madre"" used to make!  

We are thrilled to have such a terrific Mexican place as El Jalapeño nearby."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,I really like a restaurant that continues to perform. I first came here shortly after they opened and have since been on many occasions. The lunch specials are quick and taste great. The menu offers a variety of both very authentic as well as the traditional items you find in Mexican/American restaurants.
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"First of all I quite enjoy the decor of this place. Fun and colorful, many  depicting the harvest of the agave (for mezcal perhaps?).

Second, I open up the menu to find mojarra frita, an authentic traditional dish I've had a few times in the homes of friends. For those who don't know that is a whole fish (tilapia most likely), head included, fried whole and served with tortillas. The dish was moist and with a squeeze of lime and some Valentina it was a pleasent afternoon lunch.

The carne asada my wife had was moist and had pretty good flavor as well. Not amazing but respectable.

On the downside, I wish the fish was served with a bit more avocado than the small sliver I got and perhaps some homemade salsa that would go with it. Also the rice and beans were just ok which is too bad as it gives those two staples of mexican cuisine a poor name (numerous restaurants are guilty of downplaying these two dishes). If done right just give me a place of beans and rice and some flour tortillas and salsa and let me go to town.

Final verdict though is that the people are very friendly and the food is respectable. I will most likely swing by again soon and grab myself a torta."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,Hidden Gem! Great little restaurant with deliciously fresh food and fun friendly waitstaff. Go for tacos and burritos and homemade soups and then take a wAlk next door and take a browse through the Mexican Market. The margaritas were delicious as well!
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"This place has great mexican!  We got tacos of 4 different types.  All were great, but the el pastor (barbecue pork) was amazing.  The homemade chips and salsa were also really good -- the salsa had a touch of mexican oregano in it giving it a great flavor.  I would highly recommend to anyone!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"We visited for lunch on the recommendation of a friend who her knows her tacos, and she was correct: Excellent. Tacos are of the small variety (a bonus to me). I had the chorizo and the filling was perfectly crispy, not greasy, with a lovely salad of cilantro and sweet onion on top. My husband had the weekend special carnitas. Meat was succulent yet caramelized on the outside.  The sauce served on the side was smoky and spicy and complemented the meat very well. 

Service was quick and genuinely friendly. The decor is very artful and the wooden blinds let in light but help you forget you are at a strip mall."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"The tacos here are tasty!  I'm glad I decided to give this place a try.  This location used to be La Guanajuatence, which had an amazing salsa bar and delicious tacos.  This new restaurant doesn't boast a salsa bar and the salsa they serve with the chips is mediocre, but the tacos are still tasty.  

I ordered the carne asada taco, chorizo taco, lengua taco and a chicken tamale with onions and cilantro on everything. They brought out a smoky salsa in a squeeze tube with the tacos.  The lengua taco was delicious.  The beef tongue was tender and juicy.  The chorizo taco was full of flavor.  Chorizo can be very greasy but I felt that this was just right for me.  Everything was ordered a la carte, so no rice and no beans and that's just how I prefer it.  

The only thing I was not a fan of the chicken tamale.  I found it too heavy in the masa and light on the filling. It felt dry, and I wouldn't order it again.  It's a shame because apparently the market in the same plaza makes amazing tamales on the weekends.  

I haven't tried other things on the menu, and honestly, I probably never will.  Tacos are what I love and I almost never want anything else."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Not bad, but not all that great either. Based on previous reviews, I get the sense that Wisconsinites have no idea of what good Mexican food tastes like (probably because most of the Mexican restaurants here suck).

Cheap prices, sure. Flavorful food, no way.

Everything was very bland. Salsa tasted like they opened a can of diced tomatoes and put it in a bowl. Meat in the tacos was under-seasoned. Most food was bland with no flavor. Even the guacamole. When you make guacamole, you need to *at least* add salt and lime (if not add pico de gallo). Tasted like mashed avocado on a plate, no more. Margaritas were good and cheap during happy hour!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Ordered delivery to my hotel room while in town on a business trip. I got 2 pescado and 1 shrimp taco. Delivery was quick, I used the Eatstreet app. Tacos were okay, a little soggy by the time I got them. The hot sauce and limes they provided, made all the difference. I ended up just taking out the taco fillings and eating them with the rice and refried beans. Overall tasty but sogginess made them...Meh

Also as I mentioned I'm in a hotel...minus a star because I was given rice and beans but not given any utensils!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"We were in the mood for Mexican Food.   Not a lot of choices in Madison, but found this on Yelp.  

As stated in other reviews, lots of construction in the area so the best way to enter the strip mall parking lot is by heading southbound on Midvale to the restaurant.  The restaurant is on the west side of the street.

Service was excellent, not overbearing, very down to earth.

Food came extremely fast and was very fresh and authentic to me.  The flour tortillas on the tacos tasted like they were made seconds before they placed the meat on the taco.

The chips were delicious.

Reasonable prices and excellent service.  Definitely want to head back soon."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Authentic, delicious and affordable.  Love the shrimp tacos with grilled onions and cilantro.  Their posole soup (only available on weekends) is awesome."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Cheap, fast and delicious. For the 3 of us we had 7 tacos and soda. Our total cost was $21. Can't beat that. Love their beef tongue taco. If u love spicy, don't forget to ask for their special spicy sauce. It goes so good with their tacos."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Ate in for lunch.

The good: Beer was cold, and service was fast.

The bad: To start, it smelled like there was a plumbing issue in the restaurant. I ordered the ""vegetable"" (note, not ""vegetarian"") tacos lunch and was served tacos with beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Was expecting roasted or sauteed vegetables, not beans. And I certainly expect onions and cilantro rather than lettuce and tomato at a taqueria. The beans were flavorless, the rice not much better. When I asked for the fountain soda that was included in the lunch special, I was given a completely flat soft drink. Finally, in my opinion, the prices are a little high, and I was not offered a receipt when I paid.

Overall: Would give them a second try, but certainly wouldn't pay for it."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Stopped for lunch today.  Friendly staff and charming decor!  Food was very good, great service, too.  Will definitely return to try other choices from their interesting menu."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,Excellent food and great service! I recommend the tacos pescados muy bueno.   Don't know why I have never heard good things but this is a hidden treasure in madison. Donde esta Los tacos vatos
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"This place is super delicious and the atmosphere is full of vibrant colors. We went on a Sunday, lured in by the carnitas special and $5 margaritas. The margaritas are definitely worth the splurge and pack a tequila punch. 

The carnitas special came with a large portion of pico de gallo, rice, beans, and about 6 corn tortillas. Everything was super delicious and paired with the smoky, hot sauce that is brought out with the chips makes it perfect. I would highly recommend this dish.

My dining companion ordered the burrito suizo and while it was absolutely huge it comes smothered in nacho cheese sauce...this seems odd and not quite what we were expecting. Delicious, just different. 

I definitely will be back her to try the tacos. I think sticking to the simpler items seems to be the best way to ensure a good meal here."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Consistently great food. I love the colorful tables and chairs. We usually order off the ala carte menu (tacos, sopes, tostatas etc) to get a variety of eats. 2 or 3 things off this menu is the perfect amount of food."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Delicious Tacos! We had the chicken, carne asada, and shredded pork. The chicken and pork were especially tasty. We also enjoyed the chips and salsa and a horchata to drink. All in all, it was a delicious meal. Only down side was the heart burn afterwards, but I'll still give 5 stars"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"I've gotta say, I'm really happy about this place.  I'm a Mexican guy from SoCal, who's also spent a bunch of time in San Diego, so I've seen my share of taquerias.  This place, though not world class, does several things right.

First of all, the service here is good. It's easy to get neglected/ignored in some taquerias - it just part of the deal.  Second, and this is big for me, the refried beans are very good. Most places don't get them right, but these are excellent. I had the carnitas (fried pork roast)  plate. The carnitas were moist and tender and not fatty at all. My wife had tacos which were meaty and tasty (and cheap).  The asada was solid. The real winner was our teenage son, who had the suizo burrito.  It's a gigantic burrito stuffed with meat, beans and rice (but mostly meat) smothered in cheese sauce and sour cream.  Kind of like a mammoth Mexican cheesesteak. It even had more cheese inside of it.  He was giddy. He went into a crazed feeding frenzy and said it was one the best things ever.  They also had horchata, a creamy rice drink, which is delicious and not all places have it.

I rate restaurants by whether I'd go there if they were in L.A.  I wouldn't drive very far to get to El Jalapeño in L.A., but now I live in Madison. I may go again tomorrow."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"This is my favorite taqueria in the city hands down.  The spot reminds me of Mexican food trucks in LA. The menu is very standard: tacos, burritos, asada, and some other basics.

Typically when I come I'll order the burrito; medium or large depending on how hungry I am.  I'm a purist so it's rice, beans, and meat in the burrito for me.  I've had the chicken, lomo, and carne asada in the burrito and I love it all.  For me this is the best thing on the menu.  The meat is well seasoned and it's just really good!  I've also had most of their tacos and have loved those also.  Their tortillas are made fresh too! How awesome is that?!

Their fresh salsa is a bit watery but you see that it's fresh so no complaints here.  Also, they bring out this super spicy salsa in this red container with the salsa that is SO good!!! 

The place is also always clean and the service is quick!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"It's my absolute favorite taqueria. I just about always get the steak burrito. Do you ever find yourself wishing you were at that moment eating something else? I am going to admit that sometimes (while midway through an entirely different meal) I have wished I was eating one of these burritos. Online is totally anonymous, right? Super tamales and tacos too!!!  The only itty bitty thing is the margaritas. Don't bother, get a beer."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Awesome decor!  Come at least to pick a cool chair to sit in and THEN enjoy the yummy food.  Fast, plenty and reasonably priced.  I had the chicken tacos (hard shell tortillas).  Really liked the rice, too."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"If I could eat 14 tacos in a row, I would go here. Carne Asada, Pastor, Lomo, Lengua (Beef tongue), Tripa, Buche (pork stomach), oh my!! Seriously - 14 different kinds of tacos! 

Sadly, I only had four:
1) Pollo - delicious! 
2) Pull pork - even more delicious than the chicken. I could eat this all day long.
3) Pastor - decent
4) Carne Asada, I wish I hadn't saved this for last. It tasted like they didn't even add any spices.

As for the decor - the benches are brightly colored wooden scenes and kind of neat to see on their own.

Margaritas were a little pricier than I was expecting. When you're done eating, pay at the counter near the door.

Overall - a solid taco recommendation."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,We are from Texas and love this place. Reminds us of DFW mom and pop places. The food is great and so are the prices. Love the shrimp and fish tacos. Margaritas are good and toxic. Get the sopapia as well.
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"The word that stuck in my head was 'pedestrian'.  The food is pedestrian.  Its ok.  

Its your basic, mid-tier city Mexican. Space is cool as they have a lot of colorful, handmade Mexican art.  

Pork tacos were ok.  Beans were meh.  Rice was ok.  Salsa tasted like a jar.  Chips were bagged.  

If we were in Marshfield (from whence they came) this would serve fine.  But in Madison there are better options."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"I have been here several times and am a big fan of their tacos and their carnitas on the weekends.  It seems like in my experience, this place is at it's best when it is making more authentic Mexican food, as opposed to Tex-mex.  I always get lengua (tongue), tripa (tripe/intestine) and campechano tacos, and they are all excellent.  I get the feeling some of the people who have had bad experiences have ordered less authentic dishes.  Their burritos and nachos tend to be less than stellar in my experience, so if someone only ordered those, I could see them being underwhelmed.

On the weekends, the carnitas are about as good as it gets.  A huge portion with rice and beans for about $8 or $9, so good.

I see lots of negative comments about the salsa, and I agree it isn't the best, but it isn't horrible either.  Also, it is free salsa, how much can you really complain about it?  On the plus side, I find their hot sauce to be very good; good flavor, heat, and definitely homemade.

Stick with the authentic dishes, especially tacos, and you can't really go wrong.  Some of the best authentic tacos in town."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Okay so I moved to madison about 5 years ago and ever since I have been on the hunt for good authentic mexican food. I think I've finally found it. My boyfriend and I decided to order it for delivery (that's one of the downsides is that the delivery service is slow...takes about hour to an hour and a half to get your food) anyways. The first time we ordered, our food arrived cold which isn't the restaurants fault it's the service but even though it was cold it was still good! How does that even happen?! We always get a Pollo taco, a tamale, guacamole and flautas. The chicken is sometimes a little dry but once you throw some hot salsa on it, it's fine. All in all I like it and can appreciate that they prepare the tacos traditionally. (Corn tortillas, cilantro and onion yummy!!!)"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,Stopped by today for some tacos. As always the food was great and service excellent. Not sure why the vegetarian would go here?? It's for people who eat meat. Not people that eat rabbit food. Maybe find a salad bar somewhere else. Over all always solid food with great service and you can't beat the price.
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"I had never been here before, but decided to check the reviews. There was quite a mix, those that rave and those not raving so much :). That made me more intrigued to try it out. Here is my take. 

The place was clean, service was fast and friendly, and the food was out in no time. That's a good start. 

Before I even placed my order I had chips and salsa in front of me. The salsa as other described was a bit watery. You might describe it as a rougher chop salsa, rather than a smooth blended salsa. At first, it tasted fine, but as I ate more there was some ingredient I just couldn't place my finger on. But whatever it was, it wasn't my favorite. The salsa became my least favorite part of my meal. 

I ordered the taco lunch (2 tacos, rice, beans, drink) for $7.99.  I got a chorizo taco and a steak and pork taco. You can choose between lettuce and tomato or cilantro and onion. I opted for what feels more authentic cilantro and onion. 

I thought the tacos were great. Authentic with two corn tortillas for each with some homemade hot sauce on the side. I would happily order both again. 

I also thought the beans were good and the rice was fine, but nothing spectacular. 

I was torn between a 3 and 4 star review. In the end, the odd ingredient flavor of the salsa pushed me to a 3 star. I mean salsa is a cornerstone of a good Mexican restaurant. 

I'd eat here again, but if their salsa has anything extra besides the usual ingredients, they should probably alter their recipe."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Reviewing as it happens:
Unsavory location prevented me from visiting sooner. It's 5:36 pm on a Saturday night and the place is mostly empty. It's bigger inside than I expected. Friendly staff seem honestly grateful for customers. They really want me to order a drink but their margaritas are made from a mix (meh) so I pass. Free chips and salsa are a C+. Not stale but not fresh either. I ordered a trio of tacos - pork, chicken and fish. Served in double homemade soft corn tortillas. Meat, cilantro and onions are the only ingredients in each. Chicken is very good; moist. No cheese. Could have used something. Fish taco is also OK. Pork has more flavor (duh) but is a tiny bit dry and super salty. Perhaps their best dish isn't tacos but that will have to wait until next time. The prices are reasonable and I'd come back."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,1. tacos lunch,"Great spot, was just visiting for thanksgiving and made it out to jalapeños, I had a great lunch and the staff was very friendly and the prices we good. I will return."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"El Jalapeno is a great upgrade from the previous establishment and I'm glad to see another very good authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Prices are completely reasonable, salsa is quite tasty, and the food is right on par with Taqueria Guadalajara in my opinion.

What's really surprising is that this isn't a hole in the wall once you actually walk into the place despite how the former establishment was and how the outside of complex looks.  They have some TVs, a colorful atmosphere, a good amount of seating, and very friendly staff.

Their gorditas are the go-to favorite for both my wife and I, and their tacos and chimichangas are also top notch.

Madison is very hit or miss with Mexican from what I've experienced (and I've tried a decent amount of places on both sides of town), so make sure to get to El Jalapeno if you're a fan of food from south of the border.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's right on par with the best of Madison."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Although the food was decent (I used to live in San Diego, so I know what really good Mexican cuisine tastes like), I was somewhat alienated by the service I received, and felt like I was the victim of a bait and switch.

While placing my order for a burrito and chimichanga online, I opted to include chips and salsa with the chimichanga, which listed a cost of $0.50 to do so. I also asked for guacamole on the side in the notes for my chimichanga since adding guacamole wasn't an option. When I got there to pick my order 20 minutes later, it wasn't ready yet. Furthermore, I was informed that the chips and salsa were actually $1.99, and that there was an error with the price ordering through yelp. Rather than giving me the benefit of the doubt for their mistake, I had to pay 4 times the cost for the chips and salsa that I had agreed to when placing my order. I was also informed the guacamole was $1 extra for a tiny cup of it on the side.

Another 10 minutes or so later, I got my order, and took it home for my gf and I to eat. The chimichangas were pretty good, but apparently her burrito wasn't very good, and the main ingredient in it appeared to be lettuce.

Based solely on the food, I'd say this place would be a 3 star joint. But based on them sticking it to me for their pricing mistake, and the length of time it took to get my order (BTW, when I got there, they didn't seem at all busy), the cost of the order (nearly $20), and the overall quality, I'm giving them a 1. Hopefully this will balance out the current undeserved (IMO) 4 star rating.

The search for a great Mexican restaurant in Madison continues."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"My husband and I are thrilled that El Jalapeno is open and in our neighborhood. We've been there twice in the past month. He always gets the tacos... each a different kind. I've had the carnitas and shredded pork torta. It tastes just like what we used to be able to find in Houston. We are SO thankful for authentic Mexican tastes and for the efforts of this family, as it is clearly a family business. Service was prompt and thoughtful - the waitress even helped Husband remember how to order jalapenos ""toreados"", which is grilled/blackened like he likes them. We will keep visiting this perfect little place!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"I lived on the Mexican border of Texas in my childhood. My parents took us into Mexico often. We had a Mexican-American live-in housekeeper who cooked for us... so, I know MY food, both Tex-Mex and Mexican. 

El Jalapeño is the ""real deal."" Living in Nakoma, a few blocks away, we've been there since it opened and returned time and again. The owners are from Jalisco, the seating made of hand-crafted Jalisco painted wood, complimented by original oil paintings. The lighting is bright... as is customary in Mexico!

The food is fantastic. There are many on here who complain about this or that (mainly, it seems, the salsa that comes with the chips.) Why so much focus on the salsa?! The chips are home-made, fresh and hot. Ask for another salsa (a hotter, richer flavored one, as we did) and move on!

Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"This place is tucked away and not super accessible, but be ready for some super tasty Authentic Mexican Fare. The salsa is fresh and spicy , the chips thin and warm. Together they make a great snack. You will need it because the wonderful aroma of grilled steak and chicken fills the place and makes you hungrier!  
    I had the shrimp quesadilla and was pleasantly surprised at how full and flavorful it was. Loaded with fresh ingredients and it was on my table just minutes after we placed our order. We also had the queso dip (a must if you have kids) and it was the highlight of supper for my daughter!  They are very  fast for getting your order to you. 
     Don't call ahead an order, it literally is faster than fast food of you order to go when you get there. I have waited longer at Taco Bell every time than here!"

Much of this could be what I order, so I'll most certainly be back to try the things that folks here have raved about. But the positive reviews make me wonder if I'm missing something. The salsa is rough. Watery. Flavorless. I'd rather have Pace. And the chicken fajitas have no flavor. I don't understand! Throw meat onto a screaming hot skillet and your certain to build up a nice crust on the the outside. But nada. The rice and beans follow suit. Bland and boring. Again, maybe I'm not ordering the right things?"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Pretty good Mexican cuisine. I'm from San Antonio, so I have a peculiar taste for Tex-Mex food. Living in Madison, there really isn't much that stands out as fantastic but this place had its pros...

1.) steak milanesa was yummy
2.) staff was super sweet
3.) food was quick n hot
4.) margaritas were good and 2 for 1
5.) beans weren't from a can
6.) salsa was unique w/ a hint of cilantro
7.) rice was okay
8.) chicken enchiladas were good

Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Yesterday was my first opportunity to try El Jalapeno.  I ordered take out at the restaurant.  Since I am a vegetarian, I need to whine, just a tad.  The menu does not have a separate section for vegetarian dishes as many of the other Mexican restaurants do here in Madison.  See...just a tad.

I ordered the Chile Relleno with rice and beans.  For vegheads wondering if there is any type of meat product in the rice and beans, the woman who took my order assured me that they do not put any animal broth/stock in the rice and they do not cook the beans in pork/lard.  I was happy to hear that.

Okay, my critique of the food.  The rice wasn't bad and the beans were pretty good.  You can tell the food was cooked that day, which is something I really pay attention to.  Nothing tasted old or out of a can.  Now as for the Chile Relleno itself.  Good, but tough.  I'm not sure if they roast the poblano peppers first or not.  If they don't, they really should.  My knife and right arm were getting a work-out.  Also, there were several seeds in the pepper that should have been removed beforehand.  I nearly broke a tooth at one point.  Yeah, okay, okay, I'm over-exaggerating.  

Is El Jalapeno better than other Mexican restaurants? Worse?  Hmmmm...good question.  It really does depend on your personal preference and taste I guess.  My personal preference is still El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara.  However, you should still try El Jalapeno if you are in the neighborhood or wanting to try something new instead of always going to Laredos.  (I have nothing against Laredos, honestly)

Why only 3 stars?  This is due to a tough poblano pepper that had only a small amount of cheese in it.  Was a bit small too.  Otherwise I would have given it 4 stars.  I will come back, for sure."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Fast, friendly, fresh. Try the flautas with chicken, or the gorditas with steak. The hot sauce is nice and spicy and flavorful. We get takeout from here about every other week and the food is consistently delish. Even the rice and beans are good."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"If you want to have authentic Mexican food, go to Tagueria.  The food is really good and people are very friendly.  If you go to this place and you are one of the few people who are not Mexicans, you know it's a good place.  The location is not the best, especially that is right by a very busy road, but it doesn't matter after their first tasty Margarita"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Eat here!!!!!!!!!  My favorite traditional Mexican in Madison!  I love the gorditas, the fresh corn tortilla is soft on the inside but light crispy texture on then outside.   I usually get the pastor but other options have all been consistent!  Hot sauce in the big bottle is wonderful and guacamole is so fresh!   

It's very family friendly, service is super quick and everyone has been warm and inviting!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"I've gotta say, I'm really happy about this place.  I'm a Mexican guy from SoCal, who's also spent a bunch of time in San Diego, so I've seen my share of taquerias.  This place, though not world class, does several things right.

First of all, the service here is good. It's easy to get neglected/ignored in some taquerias - it just part of the deal.  Second, and this is big for me, the refried beans are very good. Most places don't get them right, but these are excellent. I had the carnitas (fried pork roast)  plate. The carnitas were moist and tender and not fatty at all. My wife had tacos which were meaty and tasty (and cheap).  The asada was solid. The real winner was our teenage son, who had the suizo burrito.  It's a gigantic burrito stuffed with meat, beans and rice (but mostly meat) smothered in cheese sauce and sour cream.  Kind of like a mammoth Mexican cheesesteak. It even had more cheese inside of it.  He was giddy. He went into a crazed feeding frenzy and said it was one the best things ever.  They also had horchata, a creamy rice drink, which is delicious and not all places have it.

I rate restaurants by whether I'd go there if they were in L.A.  I wouldn't drive very far to get to El Jalapeño in L.A., but now I live in Madison. I may go again tomorrow."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"This is my favorite taqueria in the city hands down.  The spot reminds me of Mexican food trucks in LA. The menu is very standard: tacos, burritos, asada, and some other basics.

Typically when I come I'll order the burrito; medium or large depending on how hungry I am.  I'm a purist so it's rice, beans, and meat in the burrito for me.  I've had the chicken, lomo, and carne asada in the burrito and I love it all.  For me this is the best thing on the menu.  The meat is well seasoned and it's just really good!  I've also had most of their tacos and have loved those also.  Their tortillas are made fresh too! How awesome is that?!

Their fresh salsa is a bit watery but you see that it's fresh so no complaints here.  Also, they bring out this super spicy salsa in this red container with the salsa that is SO good!!! 

The place is also always clean and the service is quick!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Awesome decor!  Come at least to pick a cool chair to sit in and THEN enjoy the yummy food.  Fast, plenty and reasonably priced.  I had the chicken tacos (hard shell tortillas).  Really liked the rice, too."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"The word that stuck in my head was 'pedestrian'.  The food is pedestrian.  Its ok.  

Its your basic, mid-tier city Mexican. Space is cool as they have a lot of colorful, handmade Mexican art.  

Pork tacos were ok.  Beans were meh.  Rice was ok.  Salsa tasted like a jar.  Chips were bagged.  

If we were in Marshfield (from whence they came) this would serve fine.  But in Madison there are better options."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"I have been here several times and am a big fan of their tacos and their carnitas on the weekends.  It seems like in my experience, this place is at it's best when it is making more authentic Mexican food, as opposed to Tex-mex.  I always get lengua (tongue), tripa (tripe/intestine) and campechano tacos, and they are all excellent.  I get the feeling some of the people who have had bad experiences have ordered less authentic dishes.  Their burritos and nachos tend to be less than stellar in my experience, so if someone only ordered those, I could see them being underwhelmed.

On the weekends, the carnitas are about as good as it gets.  A huge portion with rice and beans for about $8 or $9, so good.

I see lots of negative comments about the salsa, and I agree it isn't the best, but it isn't horrible either.  Also, it is free salsa, how much can you really complain about it?  On the plus side, I find their hot sauce to be very good; good flavor, heat, and definitely homemade.

Stick with the authentic dishes, especially tacos, and you can't really go wrong.  Some of the best authentic tacos in town."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Okay so I moved to madison about 5 years ago and ever since I have been on the hunt for good authentic mexican food. I think I've finally found it. My boyfriend and I decided to order it for delivery (that's one of the downsides is that the delivery service is slow...takes about hour to an hour and a half to get your food) anyways. The first time we ordered, our food arrived cold which isn't the restaurants fault it's the service but even though it was cold it was still good! How does that even happen?! We always get a Pollo taco, a tamale, guacamole and flautas. The chicken is sometimes a little dry but once you throw some hot salsa on it, it's fine. All in all I like it and can appreciate that they prepare the tacos traditionally. (Corn tortillas, cilantro and onion yummy!!!)"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"I had never been here before, but decided to check the reviews. There was quite a mix, those that rave and those not raving so much :). That made me more intrigued to try it out. Here is my take. 

The place was clean, service was fast and friendly, and the food was out in no time. That's a good start. 

Before I even placed my order I had chips and salsa in front of me. The salsa as other described was a bit watery. You might describe it as a rougher chop salsa, rather than a smooth blended salsa. At first, it tasted fine, but as I ate more there was some ingredient I just couldn't place my finger on. But whatever it was, it wasn't my favorite. The salsa became my least favorite part of my meal. 

I ordered the taco lunch (2 tacos, rice, beans, drink) for $7.99.  I got a chorizo taco and a steak and pork taco. You can choose between lettuce and tomato or cilantro and onion. I opted for what feels more authentic cilantro and onion. 

I thought the tacos were great. Authentic with two corn tortillas for each with some homemade hot sauce on the side. I would happily order both again. 

I also thought the beans were good and the rice was fine, but nothing spectacular. 

I was torn between a 3 and 4 star review. In the end, the odd ingredient flavor of the salsa pushed me to a 3 star. I mean salsa is a cornerstone of a good Mexican restaurant. 

I'd eat here again, but if their salsa has anything extra besides the usual ingredients, they should probably alter their recipe."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican rice,"Good food, which includes standard Americanized Mexican dishes and more authentic opinions for the more adventurous palate.  There is lots of good Mexican cuisine in the area, but what keeps us coming back to el Jalapeno is their service.  We have met friends there and every time the staff have quickly accommodated our large group, which has included 3-5 young kids.  The experience is nothing flashy, but for a good, quick meal it's a fun pick."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"El Jalapeno is a great upgrade from the previous establishment and I'm glad to see another very good authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Prices are completely reasonable, salsa is quite tasty, and the food is right on par with Taqueria Guadalajara in my opinion.

What's really surprising is that this isn't a hole in the wall once you actually walk into the place despite how the former establishment was and how the outside of complex looks.  They have some TVs, a colorful atmosphere, a good amount of seating, and very friendly staff.

Their gorditas are the go-to favorite for both my wife and I, and their tacos and chimichangas are also top notch.

Madison is very hit or miss with Mexican from what I've experienced (and I've tried a decent amount of places on both sides of town), so make sure to get to El Jalapeno if you're a fan of food from south of the border.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it's right on par with the best of Madison."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"Although the food was decent (I used to live in San Diego, so I know what really good Mexican cuisine tastes like), I was somewhat alienated by the service I received, and felt like I was the victim of a bait and switch.

While placing my order for a burrito and chimichanga online, I opted to include chips and salsa with the chimichanga, which listed a cost of $0.50 to do so. I also asked for guacamole on the side in the notes for my chimichanga since adding guacamole wasn't an option. When I got there to pick my order 20 minutes later, it wasn't ready yet. Furthermore, I was informed that the chips and salsa were actually $1.99, and that there was an error with the price ordering through yelp. Rather than giving me the benefit of the doubt for their mistake, I had to pay 4 times the cost for the chips and salsa that I had agreed to when placing my order. I was also informed the guacamole was $1 extra for a tiny cup of it on the side.

Another 10 minutes or so later, I got my order, and took it home for my gf and I to eat. The chimichangas were pretty good, but apparently her burrito wasn't very good, and the main ingredient in it appeared to be lettuce.

Based solely on the food, I'd say this place would be a 3 star joint. But based on them sticking it to me for their pricing mistake, and the length of time it took to get my order (BTW, when I got there, they didn't seem at all busy), the cost of the order (nearly $20), and the overall quality, I'm giving them a 1. Hopefully this will balance out the current undeserved (IMO) 4 star rating.

The search for a great Mexican restaurant in Madison continues."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"My husband and I are thrilled that El Jalapeno is open and in our neighborhood. We've been there twice in the past month. He always gets the tacos... each a different kind. I've had the carnitas and shredded pork torta. It tastes just like what we used to be able to find in Houston. We are SO thankful for authentic Mexican tastes and for the efforts of this family, as it is clearly a family business. Service was prompt and thoughtful - the waitress even helped Husband remember how to order jalapenos ""toreados"", which is grilled/blackened like he likes them. We will keep visiting this perfect little place!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"I lived on the Mexican border of Texas in my childhood. My parents took us into Mexico often. We had a Mexican-American live-in housekeeper who cooked for us... so, I know MY food, both Tex-Mex and Mexican. 

El Jalapeño is the ""real deal."" Living in Nakoma, a few blocks away, we've been there since it opened and returned time and again. The owners are from Jalisco, the seating made of hand-crafted Jalisco painted wood, complimented by original oil paintings. The lighting is bright... as is customary in Mexico!

The food is fantastic. There are many on here who complain about this or that (mainly, it seems, the salsa that comes with the chips.) Why so much focus on the salsa?! The chips are home-made, fresh and hot. Ask for another salsa (a hotter, richer flavored one, as we did) and move on! 

The food is what this place is about and it is DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC. This is much, much more than a 'tacos joint.' In fact, the 'Carne Asado' entree platter at 
$ 10.99 is a steal. Thin slices of flank steak, perfectly grilled accompany fresh, hot corn tortillas, along with cactus leaf (delicious,) a chopped Mexican lettuce salad, rice and beans. No lard or trans fat, so the latter two were light and flavorful. The platter was huge, almost enough for two.

I love their 'Enchiladas Platter' also. You can choose the filling: steak, pork, chicken, etc. and they are perfectly cooked and yummy.

We've had most everything on the menu. There is nothing I wouldn't order again, the food is that good.... and so very, very reasonable for the quality. Most dinner or lunch entrees are $ 7.99.  Service is friendly, delightful and unobtrusive. One pays at the cash register (as in Mexico,) when one is ready to leave. We love that!

By the way, the local Mexican-American population has discovered El Jalapeño. It is packed with families and others, which is the best sign that this place is authentic and just like ""madre"" used to make!  

We are thrilled to have such a terrific Mexican place as El Jalapeño nearby."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"This place is tucked away and not super accessible, but be ready for some super tasty Authentic Mexican Fare. The salsa is fresh and spicy , the chips thin and warm. Together they make a great snack. You will need it because the wonderful aroma of grilled steak and chicken fills the place and makes you hungrier!  
    I had the shrimp quesadilla and was pleasantly surprised at how full and flavorful it was. Loaded with fresh ingredients and it was on my table just minutes after we placed our order. We also had the queso dip (a must if you have kids) and it was the highlight of supper for my daughter!  They are very  fast for getting your order to you. 
     Don't call ahead an order, it literally is faster than fast food of you order to go when you get there. I have waited longer at Taco Bell every time than here!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"We were in the mood for Mexican Food.   Not a lot of choices in Madison, but found this on Yelp.  

As stated in other reviews, lots of construction in the area so the best way to enter the strip mall parking lot is by heading southbound on Midvale to the restaurant.  The restaurant is on the west side of the street.

Service was excellent, not overbearing, very down to earth.

Food came extremely fast and was very fresh and authentic to me.  The flour tortillas on the tacos tasted like they were made seconds before they placed the meat on the taco.

The chips were delicious.

Reasonable prices and excellent service.  Definitely want to head back soon."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"Pretty good Mexican cuisine. I'm from San Antonio, so I have a peculiar taste for Tex-Mex food. Living in Madison, there really isn't much that stands out as fantastic but this place had its pros...

1.) steak milanesa was yummy
2.) staff was super sweet
3.) food was quick n hot
4.) margaritas were good and 2 for 1
5.) beans weren't from a can
6.) salsa was unique w/ a hint of cilantro
7.) rice was okay
8.) chicken enchiladas were good
9.) nice tables n chairs
10.) kid friendly

I would go back no question. :)"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"Cheap, fast and delicious. For the 3 of us we had 7 tacos and soda. Our total cost was $21. Can't beat that. Love their beef tongue taco. If u love spicy, don't forget to ask for their special spicy sauce. It goes so good with their tacos."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,mexican soda,"Ate in for lunch.

The good: Beer was cold, and service was fast.

The bad: To start, it smelled like there was a plumbing issue in the restaurant. I ordered the ""vegetable"" (note, not ""vegetarian"") tacos lunch and was served tacos with beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Was expecting roasted or sauteed vegetables, not beans. And I certainly expect onions and cilantro rather than lettuce and tomato at a taqueria. The beans were flavorless, the rice not much better. When I asked for the fountain soda that was included in the lunch special, I was given a completely flat soft drink. Finally, in my opinion, the prices are a little high, and I was not offered a receipt when I paid.

Overall: Would give them a second try, but certainly wouldn't pay for it."

El Bolillo Bakery,side of avocado,"I was waiting to review this place until I'd broken into the giant bag of tamales we brought home and put in our freezer, and I'm glad I did, because now I can tell you to run, don't walk, to El Bolillo and get yourself some authentic and delicious mexican food.

We visited El Bolillo for a late lunch on a Sunday, and were the only people in the place when we got there. We gazed at the menu for a bit, but both ended up ordering chicken enchiladas, since my companion had had them before and raved about them.

 Before the enchiladas came, the owner came out and asked us if we wanted to try a new sandwich he's been working on. Well, we both love free food and experiments, so of course we said yes. What we got we a fresh sesame bun stuffed with carnitas, cilantro, and green salsa, and boy was it delicious. We sort of wanted to forgo our enchiladas and just eat another one of those! Anyway, we got to have a really nice conversation with the owner, who seems to be a super friendly and enterprising guy, since his goal is apparently to have everyone in Madison eating these new sandwiches. I'm with him, and will be rushing back for another. 

The enchiladas were very tasty. It was a massive plate, piled high with enchiladas, lettuce, avocado, and queso fresco. I'd recommend them, but it'll be hard for me to order anything but the carnitas sandwich when I go back. 

We took home a dozen tamales for the freezer, since they're pretty much the best possible quick lunch, and they were some insanely cheap price like $5 for a dozen. Tamales are not easy to make right. All too often the masa turns out tough and rubbery or too soft, or just not flavorful. El Bolillo's masa was awesome. It was tender, but substantial and had a lot of good corny flavor. I thought the proportion of filling to masa was about right, but I wasn't totally crazy about the flavor of the filling (we had the chile-stuffed ones). I think next time I would choose a different flavor that was more to my taste."
El Bolillo Bakery,side of avocado,"Very tasty taco. They have a nice variety, and they follow the golden rule, KISS, keep it simple stupid! Seasoned wet chicken, cilantro, lime on the side, oaxaca cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion. Simple is perfect.

El Bolillo Bakery,side of avocado,"Placed order for pick-up and it was ready in less than 10 minutes. The enchiladas were fantastic-  shredded chicken, red sauce in the amount of perfection, and all the fix-ins (particularly in love with sliced avocado on top). Spicy, but not overwhelming. Mocha Bundt Cake is well worth giving into a craving for. Friendly and helpful staff. Real food, no artificial taste. Will definitely return."

Brothers Three Bar & Grill,cheese curds,"This classic Wisconsin dive tavern is known for their breakfast but this time we went for dinner. The decor of this former gas station is wood paneling like your typical basement with deer heads and fish mounted on the walls. 

We all ordered burgers and even though they cook them medium and we forgot to order medium rare they came out juicy and almost medium rare. The bacon cheese burger had three huge strips of bacon which you rarely see and a giant slab of onion. The burger was excellent.  We ordered some cheese curds and they were just ok - breaded not beer battered. The service was friendly and very quick."
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,cheese curds,"You walk in and see sort of a bar setting. Giant Green Bay Packers decor right on the side, darts, games. Peek around the corner and there's the tables set up right by the bar.
The Good:
We where immediately greeted by the bartender who happened to be our server as well. Very nice lady who gave us prompt service and made sure we where taken care of. They where playing late 70's/ early 80's music that I dug. The people there where just your good ole nice Wisconsin folks. Clean restroom. Country-feel to the place. Loved the atmosphere.
The Bad:
Sat next to a closed window that had a draft. It was about 30 degrees out and we could feel it. It's an old place- not very tightly-secured. Their deep-frying skills are off. Cheese curds where barely done, one of which was cold in the center (like, not-cooked cold) same thing with the fries. Fries also came un-salted which I don't mind but some might. The burger was sub-par. I could honestly make better burgers at home. Bun was way too thin for the thick burger. Ordered it medium well it came well done.
Long-Story-Short:
Come here to get drinks and hang out with friends, not for dinner. And don't sit by a window in the winter."
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,cheese curds,The burgers are always great! The bacon cheeseburger comes with thick slices of bacon and your choice of cheese. The drinks are good and the bartenders are always sweet! This is one of my favorite little whole in the wall bars in the city.
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,cheese curds,"One of the best burgers in Madison. Great curds, amazing cheesy soups.  This is the off the beaten path place you want to be for real Wisconsin heart.  Forget all those jokers!  Go to brothers it's amazing!"
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,chicken cordon bleu with ham and swiss sandwich basket,My husband and I tried out this place on Saturday night with a couple of friends. My husband had the prime rib it was huge and cooked perfectly. I had a chicken sandwich with bacon. Again huge portion I only ate 1/2 and was so good. The atmosphere was great with a nice mix of hipsters to business men to old timers. The staff was outstanding and the bartender made my drinks to perfection. The portion size matched the prices and the food lived up to its name. We will be back to try the fish fry!
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,chicken cordon bleu with ham and swiss sandwich basket,"Well, I've been wanting to come here for quite some time, based on other reviews.  Though, this place is a bit out of the way for me....luckily, I was in the area so decided to drive the extra 10 minutes to find the place.

Parking is very limited....

I'm tempted to give them 3.5 stars....but, can't.  That would round up to four stars, but I just can't give them 4 stars....

I came right at the peak of lunch and sat at the bar.  The character and ambiance are well described in other reviews - local, old timey, a bit rough, a bit north woodsy feeling....and I think that 'charm' in such an urban setting may be why the place gets so many really good reviews?

I'm from ""up north"" and have been to lots of local rough bars/pubs that are similar in character....m'eh....it is what it is...

Food?  Prices do seem high....I had a Reuben, only choice of sides was fries or mashed potatoes...that's kind of lame, IMHO.  No o'rings....  :(

It certainly wasn't the best Reuben I've had, though it was priced like it should've been

The sandwich was fine....nothing special.  It was a little soggy, but that's to be expected with the kraut.

Beer selection is LAME LAME LAME...like 5 or 6 types of bottle beer, no tap beers.

Service at the bar?  A bit cold-shouldered....  I think the bar tender must have been one of the brothers....didn't really seem to have time to talk, or even fake being friendly or polite.  I guess some people like that kind of service...not me.  I'm paying money to eat out...the food better be at least as good as I can make at home and the service should be friendly and at least reasonably polite....I am the customer, after all"
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,chicken cordon bleu with ham and swiss sandwich basket,"I've been here about 6 or 7 times in the last year. I went again last night, and as always had a good experience.

The food is very good. The burgers are delicious. The nightly specials might not be the cheapest, but you get a generous portion for your money.  Last night, I had a Ranch Chicken Sandwich, and it was great. It came with a heap of fries, and I had leftovers.

The service is also great. A very friendly bunch. There is always this older lady working at the bar, and she is an absolute hoot! She's friendly, funny and and reason enough to go back. The cooks also come and ask you how your food was. Really great service.

And yeah, it might suck that they don't have 30 beer taps like every other bar in Madison, but bottled beer is good enough for me."
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,chicken cordon bleu with ham and swiss sandwich basket,"Came across this restaurant threw the app. They were very busy and we sat at the bar.  Very good food, chicken cordon blue for me, awesome. Husband had walleye great portions.  Kitchen was in the bar. It was entertaining to watch the staff ."
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,chicken cordon bleu with ham and swiss sandwich basket,"Disclaimer: I am giving this place four stars for very particular reasons. Many foodies will hate this place. The food comes from Sysco. The fish is NOT fresh, although their fish fry is as good as most of the other places in town that serve unfresh fish fry. If you come to Brother's Three, you are coming for the atmosphere. This place is not attempting to be something it's not.

Here's why I love this place and go with friends weekly:

1. The staff is awesome. I tend to go in the mornings, and the server/bartender behind the bar is friendly and quick. All of the staff, though, are genial and on the ball.

2. This is a very, very, local, kitschy Wisconsin bar. You will be treated well. The jukebox has a great selection from country to rock. There is a great rectangular bar that you can sit at for every meal, and you are treated well regardless of whether you come alone or sit with friends. The place is filled with regulars at all times. The morning server makes up crazy awesome soups that the regulars love (I once stayed through breakfast and lunch doing work, and person after person came in ordering the ""Chicken Cordon Bleu soup."")

So, if you like cheap prices, great service, and Wisconsin kitsch, you will really like this place. My friends and I go weekly. Order your eggs over easy if you care about getting fresh eggs.

If you are really concerned with sustainability or are expecting very fresh food, you are going to be disappointed."
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,chicken cordon bleu with ham and swiss sandwich basket,"I found this place on Yelp while in Madison for Vietnam Vet convention.

There's oldskool country & light rock music playing, and the server was REALLY nice & helped me choose which steak I wanted. I had the Tenderloin Steak dinner, with onion hash browns & my friend ordered the Rueben sandwich platter. My steak was delicious & tender enuf to cut with a fork & the hash browns were perfect! My friend said the Rueben was just ok.  The server also introduced me to ""Spotted Cow"" beer...a local ale that was really good! I'd recommend this place easily!"

Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"Banzo does it again. This time they veer just slightly away from their regular menu and branch out into some lesser charted territories. What can I say, I prefer the path less traveled and wholeheartedly welcome their divergence into such dishes as sweet potatoes falafel and shrimp pita with apple butter and lemon cream. 

The shawarma pita was superb. An elevated take on you're average greasy wrap, their fresh baked pita is already epic and then filling it with tangy chicken, veggies, potato chips and pickles just knocks it off the cliff.  I'm already craving eating another one!!  The sweet potato falafel didn't seem to interest me, but after trying it, I quickly changed my tune; crisp outside and moist inside they are at once slightly sweet and savory and addictive as all hell. The hummus and French fries were just nails in the coffin. 

Well done, Banzo. You just wooed me (again) with a level 5 charm spell."
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"We had an office party. Some of us were vegans and we decided to order from Banzo Shuk. We had heard great reviews from some of our colleagues in office who have tried their food and boy they were so right. The Pita was very fresh and soft, Farmhouse salad was amazing. Hummus and BabaGanush was out of the world and best I have ever had. Overall we all had a great time and enjoyed some great Food. I would recommend Banzo and Banzo Shuk to all the people who love middle eastern food.  A big thumbs up !!"
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"This place is pretty fantastic.  The quality of the food is super high.  They advertise that they use local/organic ingredients whenever they can and I believe that's probably true.  We ordered the fresh cut fries, falafel pita and lamb pita.  All tasted fresh and flavorful.  The woman working the counter was very friendly and our food was ready pretty fast.  Banzo Shük is open late night in a neighborhood that could use more variety in its late night food options.  Really the only reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought some of their food items were too expensive.  The lamb pita (no sides) was $12.50 and I saw small triangles of baklava there for close to $4.  I realize that if the lamb is local/organic than that might just be what they have to charge, but I thought it was a little too steep.  Overall, I recommend checking out this place and we will definitely be back."
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"My husband and I ordered a beef pita to share with a cup of coconut curry soup and baklava. All of it was fantastic. The pita was super flavorful with perfectly seasoned beef, the baklava was rich, and the soup was delicious. I am so happy to have this place in our neighborhood and I especially love that they're open late."
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"My first experience here was pleasant.  The falafel was not bad, I enjoyed it and have always heard it is the best, but I do not personally have anything to compare it to...in my mind, it didn't taste like anything special, but again - I don't know if this stuff is supposed to have a special flavor, or it's just awesome because it's deep fried?  Haha.  My pita sandwich was good.  My only gripe is I guess portion, I was already feeling a little hungry after we left.  My husband got the turkish coffee and LOVED it, I tried it and was also a fan....the strong taste of cardamom in this coffee is sooooooooo good, the woman working recommended it as 'desert' and I think that was the way to go."
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"One of the hardest things for Madison restaurants and take out places to get right is consistency, and unfortunately this place does not deviate from the norm. My last order consisted of a sandwich filled with dry, burnt falafel balls, but also a pita a stuffed with perfectly seasoned chicken shawarma, vegetables and a delicious tahini sauce. I wish I could say that this was an anomaly, but I have had an issue with quality control on almost every order since. When they come correct, it's difficult to argue with the hype. But when they stumble, it leaves you wondering why you willingly forked over $13 for a sad lamb pita."
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"The batata falafel is heavenly! Love the spicy sauce that comes with it, too! I think it has coriander and green chilis in it? Reminds me of my mom's chutney!"
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"Banzo's a welcome addition to Willy St. I agree with another reviewer who said they need to decide if they're a restaurant or a take out place. Similar to the original Banzo location it is a self service format when dining in. But at Shuk plates were absent, making the experience of eating a large delicious falafel in a pita really messy! An order of tabouli was delivered in a plastic deli container, which was unexpected. 

They were very busy with delivery orders, and I bet they are still figuring out how much food to have on hand because they had run out of all meat items by 7 o'clock on a Saturday when they're open to 2 AM. 

I'm a huge fan of the original location and the carts. The food at Shuk is excellent quality and carefully prepared, but seemed a little under seasoned for my taste. 

They have made the small space inviting and comfortable. We'll definitely come back, try more things, and hope to add a couple more stars."
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"LATE NIGHT BANZO OMG. This is so good. So so good. Banzo is already one of my favorite restaurants in Madison and I hate having to compromise on where to go/what to get when it hits the later hours. My boyfriend and I stopped in around 12:30 on a Friday night. It seemed quiet which was sad because it should be BUSY, hoping others will soon catch on. The interior is beautiful, I love the getting a peek into the kitchen! While we waited for our sandwich and fries we were offered lamb broth to sip which was DIVINE. Our food was ready fast and we were pleased that there didn't seem to be any difference in quality/taste compared to other banzo locations. A slightly different menu make take a little getting used to for some, but I'm just really happy to have them in my neighborhood and at extended hours!"
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"This place is amazing. The food was awesome-- tasty and healthy. I love that it is open late. It is absolutely the BEST late night restaurant in town. Everyone was very pleased. I got the roasted veggie sandwich, it was tasty. Next time I hope to be able to try the baklava!"
Banzo Shük,the batata pita sandwich,"I love these from Banzo, and the new place is Supreme. I got the delicious batata falafel,  my friend had an excellent vegan version of it. Both were great.

The service was friendly too."
Banzo Shük,sweet potato falafel,"We all know Banzo is the best place for delicious falafel, but let me tell you why this location is even better than the original store front.

Sweet. Potato. Falafel.

Get it, and then thank me later after you've basked in its glory.

Also, I'm not sure how I lived prior to Banzo's hummus. I love it so much I buy it every other week at Whole Foods or the Willy Street Coop."

The Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"I love the Roman Candle in Middleton so when it came time to have a group meeting/dinner, I thought I would try RC Fitchburg. Called ahead and asked to ""reserve"" a separate section for my party of 10 which they did. Asked how crowded Monday night were and was told they are pretty quiet....not so much as it turned out!

The service was great---set up a ""buffet"" for us with our pizza and salad choices, kept us supplied with drinks (even as the place filled up). Unfortunately, it did get very busy (lots of families with loud kids) so for a group our size it was difficult to hear. And, although there were other tables available, a rather rude group of four decided that they wanted to sit where our food had been set up and ignored the server's suggestion that they sit elsewhere---one of them even began to move our food off the table until she was stopped by our server. Some people really have no manners!

We ordered off the standard menu- one veggie and one meat loaded and bith were very good. The salads were fresh and the house dressing is great! My only complaint is the price----their pizzas are good but seem a tad overpriced for pizza.

Bottom line: good pizza, nice staff and a bright airy (if a little loud) atmosphere---just watch out for rude fellow diners!"
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"I've reviewed another location before - but this is the one closest to my house - and I thought it was worth reviewing again. The pizza here is excellent, but the staff at this particular location are awesome. Always friendly and happy - zero complaints about the food or the service. One of my top 4 go-to places in town! Yum!"
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"I have not been to this place since 06/30/12 because of my last experience. Here's a snipe of my previous experience and review:

""The last time I ordered a pizza for pick up, I ordered the meatball sub pizza. For some reason, they didn't use cheese, did not add the hot peppers, and didn't even slice the pizza. For $22, at least slice the pizza! ...I won't be returning.""

Today, my wife wanted some cheese sticks to go with our homemade pasta. She suggested Roman Candle Pizzeria because it is literally down the street from us. I was very apprehensive. I swore I would never go back. Well, my wife wanted it so I ordered it.

I ordered at 6pm and was quoted 15-30 minutes for pick up (not delivery). I arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes later. Honestly, I was hoping for a better experience. The manager went to ""find"" my order. After 5 minutes, he came back and said they just put the order in and it will be another 15 minutes. Come on...really? I give you a chance again after over 2 years and this is how you show up? He apologized and said he would deliver it to my house when it was ready.

So 45 minutes after I placed the order for simple cheese sticks, it arrived at my house. The only reason I am not giving this place 1 star is because the manager personally delivered it with a pint of Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream.

Nice effort, but maybe I'll try again in a couple years."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,house salad,"I decided to try Roman Candles pizza after reading a lot of reviews about them and they actually delivered to me in Fitchburg, which not a lot of places highly rated do.  Usually I want a pizza and I get a salad with a pizza but in this case I actually wanted a salad and figured I'd get a pizza with my order just to sample some pizza.  So with some trepidation I placed an order for one small (12"") PPPepperoni pizza and one large House Salad. I called and placed the order, total with 2-2 liters of Diet Pepsi was $35 and some change.  They told me it'd be 45 minutes but there was a knock on the door at the 20 minute mark.  I got my whole order and they actually remembered my Diet Pepsi which was a big plus.  Whenever I order Diet Pepsi they usually forget it or bring regular Pepsi.  

I first tried the pizza (see my pic) and it was pretty good.  It was like most of the reviews here have said, not extraordinary but not bad either.  The three different types of pepperoni were nice.  You had the little square pieces, the large thick pepperoni and the flatter, thin pepperoni.  The crust was not fantastic but not bad, the cheese was pretty good but not overly abundant but the sauce was pretty bland and not enough of it.  All in all it was good pizza but pretty overpriced at $16.99 for the pie in my opinion.

The salad was quite good (see my pic) and they did remember to provide the Vinaigrette and French dressings.  The bacon was extra crispy and the cheese was delicious.  However they were very skimpy on the tomatoes, I only recall one cherry tomato that was cut in half in the salad and they were also stingy with the cucumber.  Oh yeah and just overall the salad itself was not big enough.  Quite delicious, especially the dressings, but not enough of a salad to justify the $8.50 price IMO. Also, just a note on the Vinaigrette, I know some folks order this dressing because of the lower calorie and fat but this vinaigrette is pretty thick and very fat-laden tasting and I don't think it'd be something to really be proud of healthwise.  Roman Candles makes this and it's damned delicious but I think I also killed my fat and calorie count by eating it.  It's so thick it's almost like a chocolate sauce.  

All in all this is pretty good food, the salad was actually better than the pizza IMO, although too small.  It's certainly better food than any fast food pizza you will find from the chains but I do agree the price is too high for what you get.  For $40.00 worth of food (including a $3.xx driver tip) you should get more than 2 decent sized meals IMO.  Perhaps this place would be better to order from when (and if) you can find a special or a coupon to use.  I'd def. order again but only if I could find some sort of online deal or something like that."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"Love this place! I have had excellent and timely service each time I've been to Roman Candle.  The staff is always very friendly, and the manager is great.  This is my favorite pizza place because they use local ingredients as much as possible as well as grass fed beef.  They have lots of very unique pizza options, and everything I have tried is good.  BBQ Chicken and the bacon cheeseburger pizzas are my favorite.  Another feature I like to take advantage of...if you are next door at the Atomic Koi (bar), they will bring your pizza over to you!  The only downside to Roman Candle is that it's a little pricey, but I don't mind paying a little extra for high quality ingredients (local/grass-fed).  You can find discount coupons pretty easily though."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"I have been to the Fitchburg location 4-5 times over the last 3 months, pizza is fresh, sauce delicious, toppings are excellent. Most recent trip was last week in August, wife and I were in late but service was attentive and food was great. Had BBQ chicken pizza - had not tried it before, but it was very good. I will be back!"
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,chicken caesar salad,"I decided to try Roman Candles pizza after reading a lot of reviews about them and they actually delivered to me in Fitchburg, which not a lot of places highly rated do.  Usually I want a pizza and I get a salad with a pizza but in this case I actually wanted a salad and figured I'd get a pizza with my order just to sample some pizza.  So with some trepidation I placed an order for one small (12"") PPPepperoni pizza and one large House Salad. I called and placed the order, total with 2-2 liters of Diet Pepsi was $35 and some change.  They told me it'd be 45 minutes but there was a knock on the door at the 20 minute mark.  I got my whole order and they actually remembered my Diet Pepsi which was a big plus.  Whenever I order Diet Pepsi they usually forget it or bring regular Pepsi.  

I first tried the pizza (see my pic) and it was pretty good.  It was like most of the reviews here have said, not extraordinary but not bad either.  The three different types of pepperoni were nice.  You had the little square pieces, the large thick pepperoni and the flatter, thin pepperoni.  The crust was not fantastic but not bad, the cheese was pretty good but not overly abundant but the sauce was pretty bland and not enough of it.  All in all it was good pizza but pretty overpriced at $16.99 for the pie in my opinion.

The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"Service was REALLY slow, even though we were the only people in the restaurant in the middle of a weekday. There were plenty of staff there, but they seemed to spend all their time chatting and folding napkins. 

Took forever to get our pizza: my friend had soup and salad and was done by the time the pizza arrived for our kids and me. Some of the pizza was barely warm, the rest was too hot to touch, and it was all dry and needed more cheese. 

Everything here is very expensive, even the $7 lunch special is a rip off when you add it up. The Algo Malo pizza is quite tasty, but costs an arm and a leg even for a small pizza.

The only thing that made this restaurant worthwhile was the children's play area. It has a table with trucks and toys, books, and even a projector and VCR with animated movies."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"I love the Roman Candle in Middleton so when it came time to have a group meeting/dinner, I thought I would try RC Fitchburg. Called ahead and asked to ""reserve"" a separate section for my party of 10 which they did. Asked how crowded Monday night were and was told they are pretty quiet....not so much as it turned out!

The service was great---set up a ""buffet"" for us with our pizza and salad choices, kept us supplied with drinks (even as the place filled up). Unfortunately, it did get very busy (lots of families with loud kids) so for a group our size it was difficult to hear. And, although there were other tables available, a rather rude group of four decided that they wanted to sit where our food had been set up and ignored the server's suggestion that they sit elsewhere---one of them even began to move our food off the table until she was stopped by our server. Some people really have no manners!

We ordered off the standard menu- one veggie and one meat loaded and bith were very good. The salads were fresh and the house dressing is great! My only complaint is the price----their pizzas are good but seem a tad overpriced for pizza.

Bottom line: good pizza, nice staff and a bright airy (if a little loud) atmosphere---just watch out for rude fellow diners!"
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"Very disappointed with the dine-in situation here. We've ordered pizzas to-go from here multiple times before and it was alright. Definitely nothing to write home about. So last night we decided to dine in with our 1.5 year old because we heard they had a play area for kids. Well this area is only good for older kids who can play arcade games. The little play structure they have is broken and pretty shoddy. The service was ridiculously slow. They apparently only had one cook in the kitchen. But they also had literally 4 tables to serve. That broke everything apparently. So it took them 50 minutes to get our order out. Add that to the 15 minutes it took the waitress to come take our orders. By which time we were all hungry and cranky. Other tables around us were also getting pretty upset, especially since the packers were playing in 30 minutes and people wanted to go back home. They did try to make up for it by giving us free soup and discounting the total amount as well. But overall this was a pretty pathetic experience. I don't think we will be returning here."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"This is our ""go to"" pizza place cuz it's in our neighborhood. Always good service and a nice selection of pies. A good place to bring the kids."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"We eat here every week. It's a great place to take your kids: there's a play area for them that my kids enjoy, and my wife and I appreciate the occasional moments of silence. The pizza is always very good, the staff is friendly and remembers us: it's a minor highlight of our week. And I haven't noticed any recent deterioration."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"My wife and i wanted to try a new pizza place in our area, and we decided on this on to eat inn. Nothing special. Also, it was crowded with families....and little children. We were there around 6pm on a Friday night. 

The waitress managed to stay on task and fill my soda when empty, so that was a plus.
We ordered a large sausage and green pepper pizza. It was a thinner crust, kinda like New York style meets thin crust. Decent tasting, and enough cheese and toppings. I would give the pizza a solid 3.5 out of 5 by itself, as for the crazy atmosphere, well there was just too many families for my liking. 2 out of 5.

Great place for mom and dad to take the kids....not so great for quiet pizza dinner."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"This is our go to pizza place in Madison. It has never disappointed.  I do consider it the best pizza place in the Madison area, but let's be honest--Madison is by no means a hotspot for good pizza, but this place is always pretty good. The price is fair, and they do pickup and delivery, which is what we tend to do.  It even has a big area in the back for kids to play in. They will have a good time here.


For a fun night, go to the Atomic Koi next door/across the hall and have the Roman Candle pizza delivered there. The fancy drinks there will make the pizza taste even better."
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,kids mac and cheese,"I've only ordered delivery from Roman Candle.  Before I realized there was a Fitchburg location (and therefore delivery in South Madison), I was resigned to pizza highs (making it myself) and lows (ordering cardboard from cheaper but crummier pizzerias).  Roman Candle fills my desire for REALLY GOOD pizza delivered to my door! 
Of the 15 specialty pizzas on the menu, we've only tried 5.  My favorites so far are the Algo Malo (beets & blue cheese!) and the Professional (broccoli! bacon! delicious!), but everything has been great.  All of the pizzas hold up for breakfast the next morning as well (although eventually Algo Malo's arugula has to be discarded), so I feel fine ordering two pizzas for two of us and eating them for the next three meals!

I only wish they delivered later, pizza is sometimes required after 9pm (10pm some weekends)!"

I really can't be more disappointed. I have had two terrible experiences here and I'm happy to say I've had my last."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"A few friends and I were craving Sushi while visiting Madison; a friend suggested Edos. 

Upon arrival I was impressed by the interior design of Edo. The restaurant had a very modern Japanese layout. Being a Chicago native where Sushi is easily accessible, I expected more from Edos considering this is one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. 

The Food:

Rolls were priced fairly. 6-9 dollars per roll which contained 6-8 pieces; average price for most dine in sushi 

My order consisted of crunchy salmon roll and a Manhattan Roll. The Manhattan Roll is spicy salmon on the inside topped off with a slice of tuna. The Tuna was thawed and tasted very mushy, almost to the point where it tasted not even fresh. 

The crunchy salmon roll consisted of spicy salmon on the inside, but after eating a few pieces I realized there was little to no salmon and even went to the extent of taking the roll apart to see what was inside; I was right, there was little to no salmon.


The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Our waiter was great, and the restaurant was very clean. The food quality is what ended Edo's with 3 stars. Food quality can be much better considering this is a Japanese Restaurant and one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. 

I will possibly be giving Edo's one more try the next time I visit Madison."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I have to admit, I'm so glad that I decided to go get sushi with my friends yesterday afternoon here, because my initial impression of Edo Garden from my delivery order wasn't pretty. 

When I ordered delivery from here (which I realize is kind of a gamble with sushi, because it gets to sit in a car for who-knows-how-long and then it's delicate construction can get undone with all the bumps) I wasn't sure what I would get. The order ended up coming within the time range that was promised, but the food was just...........mediocre. The sushi had come undone, the taste was bland/almost too fishy (and I love raw fish sushi!) and the miso soup was kind of gross. So, I had pretty much taken this place off my rotation of sushi places in Madison.

BUT, my experience last night of dining in, in person, actually made me optimistic about coming back! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is pleasing with an almost upscale pan-Asian decor, but not fancy enough where I felt out of place wearing flip-flops and a t-shirt, and the food presentation was wonderful, with the plate types and good quality chop sticks. I ordered 4 rolls, a side of fried gyoza, the miso soup, and two Mai Tai cocktails - and all of them I can say were delightful!

The Mai Tais were strong, fruity, and nicely-sized for $7.50 each - I'll be back just for these! 

The sushi I got definitely had fresh-tasting raw fish on them, and the tempura-based sushi roll I got was light and crisp, and the miso soup was much better dining in than it was via delivery.
Also, when you get delivery, they give you those fake soy sauce packets versus real soy sauce on the table when you dine in, which makes a huge difference for sushi. 

My friends both got the bento boxes for dinner and they had a pretty generous portion of each of the sections and they looked delish - the tempura shrimp pieces were huge!!

Final verdict: definitely will be back, for both the friendly and quick service, and the awesome Mai Tais and delicious food."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"EdoSushi is the best I have had in town!
These people are so personable and my daughter loves to go into the tea rooms or have a Hibachi with friends!!
Excellent service AND Great Food!!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This is one of our two go-to places for sushi -- not perfect, but pretty darn good. (New owners took over a year ago -- ignore older reviews.)

The fish selection is pretty good, and we've never gotten any questionable sushi. (The escolar we had last week was excellent.) The all-you can-eat offer (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday)  is just a ton of fun. 

They haven't developed the volume to be top-notch; the California roll has surimi, not crab, and they don't keep tobiko around. (Love Muramoto's tobiko corral sushi!) 

They are trending now to ""new sushi"" stuff -- oversized rolls in exotic plating, with sauce drizzled all over the place. It's all pretty good if you like that sort of thing. I can always try something out for a chef that wants to push his/her luck a little -- that's my job as a customer. I don't care for many of them, though -- just not my style. So I'm glad they do a darn good job on the basics. 

The regular menu is solid as well; excellent tempura and a donkatsu that works well for this good ol' Midwestern meat and potatoes guy. 

One of these days, we'll ignore the sushi and menu and do the hibachi. The customers around the hibachis all seem to be having a great time."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Probably the only place in Madison area to get AYCE sushi for one and for under $30 at that makes it better yet. Its not the very best sushi I have ever had before being I am one from San Diego where there is a sushi joint on every corner with real deal master sushi chefs running the place so consider that. Even with that the 12-15 rolls you can pick from are not half bad by any means. I had 9 of them for pete sake! I also had the miso and 2 salads they offer with the buffet and those were a hit. I liked the Golden Dragon, Black Pearl and Sweet Potato Tempura rolls best. Worth a return visit for both wallet and pallet benefit."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Overall, not a terrible experience. I prefer Takumi on almost all fronts, however. From the miso to the sushi. Some of the more specialty rolls here may be good, but I haven't tried them (they were a bit expensive for my tastes, so i skipped over them quickly). The Tokyo roll and tuna roll I ordered were good but not amazing. The fish was too room-temperature for my tastes, almost a bit gaggy, actually. The miso tasted like it was missing something, salt, maybe? I don't know, but I didn't finish it, and I usually can't get enough miso.

Three stars (instead of my gut-instinct of 2) because the service was actually excellent. The waiter gave me a lunch special even though one of the rolls I ordered was not supposed to be eligible for the combo, and was extremely attentive and friendly. Though, I was one of only two tables in the place over an after-lunchtime lull, so that may have had something to do with it, as well as me being a not-too-terribly-hideous woman eating by myself...come to think of it, he was probably hitting on me the whole time and i was just sitting there thinking, ""dang, the service here is excellent!""  dummy me...

If sushi is the menu of choice, i'll be at takumi, hands down. and I'll have to agree with Aftee in one of the other reviews: the empty pond thing right as you walk in the door is a little off-putting."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Have always had great food and service from Edo Garden in Monona. Had take-out sushi multiple times and always delicious and fresh. The best Hibachi night with Chef TJ, awesome time.!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This is the best sushi I've found in Madison so far  -- with excellent customer service.

Sushi options here in Madison seem pretty limited to me, but Edo is the best I've found so far, the quality of service, sushi and ambiance put it over the much-hyped, but underwhelming Takumi on all counts.  The sushi selections are very tasty and very fresh.  Prices are reasonable for sushi.  The private tea rooms are great options for a quiet romantic evening.

I can't really say anything about the hibachi dining or any of the other non-sushi fare since all I've tasted is the sushi, but my companions on my visits all  liked what they had.

The service here is always impeccable, some of the best I've had since moving to Madison."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Our go-to take out sushi restaurant.  The sushi and sashimi selection is exceptional.  There is a lot to choose from.  However, the service could improve."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This was my first All You Can Eat Sushi (AYCES) experience, so I don't have much to compare to in that department. From what friends told me, however, the price is good at $25 a person, which include tea/soda, miso soup, and salads. Also, from what I understand, the AYCES ""rules of the house"" are on par with other places. 

We had a group of about 16 people and the restaurant accommodated us quite well. Surprisingly, service was prompt, especially given our large party. Drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time (and the drinks are cheap!!). Miso and salads came out quickly. The sushi itself was tasty and fresh, but not the best that I've eaten in my lifetime.

AYCES rules - each person can order 2 rolls or 10 pieces of sashimi at a time. One must eat all of said pieces before ordering more. If any specialty rolls or sashimi are left on the plate at the end of the meal, you get charged for them. 

AYCES Survival TIP: Go with a group!!! If you don't like something that you ordered, someone else will! If you don't finish a roll, someone else will! 

For all that we ordered, not a bad price at $25 a pop. They even let us bring home the specialty rolls that we did not eat (and were charged for). I was so full that I probably won't want sushi for another year, but I would recommend the experience at least once in a lifetime."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"New owner keeps us coming back.  Was a customer about 7 years ago, horrible service and uncaring owner.  Decided to try it again recently and found it under new ownership.  We got to know the owner by sitting at the sushi bar, very nice man and wants happy customers.  He always remembers us when we come in (once every few months), happily greets us, talks to us, remembers what we like.  His staff is attentive and speaks good English.  Sushi is by far the best sushi in town.  Sushi lunch special is average, I'd like to see more variety on it.  We have tried the hibachi, found we like the value of the competition better (they have dinner for 2 for under $40).  You get a lot for your money at Edo Monona, but it's still pricey for hibachi in my opinion. Badger Roll is our favorite....delish!!!  They used to have a chance to win a free sushi lunch, won it once...wish they'd bring it back, or have a frequent customer club!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This restaurant is great. The prices are very reasonable and the quality is always good. I have dined-in a handful of times but for the take-out lunch specials are where it's at for ""treat yo' self"" days. 

The 2-roll lunch special clocks in at about $11 and includes miso soup and ginger salad. It's perfect. However, if I dine with a friend I like to mix it up and get a vegetable tempura bento box to split (also comes with soup, salad, rice, & dipping sauce) at about $10 it's perfect to share! So if you go the buy & share route, for about $11/person you get miso soup, ginger salad, 4 generous pieces of tempura, rice, and a full roll! It is more than I can eat When fast food meals are almost $8 - your wallet will let you splurge on food that will not last 2 years in a cupboard!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Such a disappointing place. It's meant for undergrads or folks who don't really care about the quality of food. That said, you don't really get quantity here either.

The only saving grace of the place was the sweet potato sushi. The sweet potato was fried and wrapped like a california roll. Good job!

Other items I've had were all disappointing. And sadly my friend had an upset stomach after getting sushi. So folks, the freshness of sashimi here is doubtful. I also usually get the nabeyaki udon, thinking that cooked food will be safe. There was nothing interesting in the udon. The ingredients were overcooked and tasteless. No, not even when I'm sick will I want to eat it.

Service was minimal, and they are run by Chinese, not Japanese. So I guess you can't expect much from them. 

Yeah, I only came here for the Savor Taste Race and it reminded me of the low quality food I used to have when I was an undergrad. No more visiting Edo, I'm done!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Pretty darn good, actually. We've been here 10 or 15 times and love it. Apparently we have unusual tastes because it's always empty, but that's just fine by me - never a wait, we can sit wherever we want, and the service is always good.

The entrees are always fresh and most are quite tasty. I did have one with wide, flat rice noodles that had been cooked into mush in a bean sauce, but the sushi, noodles, and teriyaki are all great. The hibachi was fun the first time, but got old pretty quick and the food there is bland and oily (though, obviously, very fresh). 

The ambiance is simple and classy - the kind you don't really notice because you're there for the food and the company. Excellent for a big group! I think the place is just not trendy enough to attract the hipster crowd who frequent other Japanese places in town. Again, fine by me."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"went here for a work lunch.  the food was a bit slow but, worth the wait.  I had the Tempura Odun - quite yummy."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This is officially my new favorite sushi place, which pisses me off to no end because it's over an hour away from my house. Bring me a Milwaukee location and I'll probably singlehandedly keep it in business!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"Came here on a Friday night. The tiny parking lot was packed, but inside was not as packed. Ordered a few vegetable rolls and seaweed salad. The avocado roll was extremely flavorless, service was ok. One person in our dinner party was given the wrong food because the waitstaff ordered the wrong food for her. Edo on Park St has always been pretty tasty. It's sad that Monona isn't just as good. The sushi rice tasted like it didn't have any vinegar added...it was just plain rice."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"If you are a sushi connoisseur this is not the place for you.  Cheap sushi, no frills, lots of roll choices.  The service was clearly lacking as no one manned the hostess stand, the wait staff was spread thin and by one waitress's own admission the kitchen staff was short also.  That being said, my food came out fast and everyone was very nice.  This is likely a place the neighborhood goes to as there were plenty of high schoolers there as well as some college kids.  If you want basic, one step up from grocery store sushi, this place will do.  $21.00 for 12 pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll.  I still wouldn't return."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"When I say DISAP you say POINTED. Disappointed!  Disappointed!  I really hate writing this review because in the past we have had such great experiences at EDO and this review is not about the food because the Sushi and Hibachi are good food.  But the service...WHOA!

Picture it...Valentines Day and my wife and almost 2 year old want a nice dinner.   We debated many nice places but with the child they can be difficult at times so we decided some Sushi and Hibachi is nice, quick and delicious.  So we plan a early arrival at a place we have been to before...EDO!  When we arrive the place is almost empty and we get one of the private dining rooms.

Sushi Rolls are ordered as an appetizer. Dumplings and chicken fried rice are ordered are ordered for our daughter to come out with the appetizers.  And a Hibachi meal to split for my wife and I as an entree. And....we wait.

After 50 minutes still no food.  Ok, starting to get annoyed.  1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting and here come our sush....nope.  it is our Hibachi entree.  WTF?  Really?  I was explained by the waitress that they had an influx of orders and were really behind.  Hmmmm, ok...so I decided to scope out the scene because they obviously had many patrons arrive after we did.  Not so much, because the place had maybe 2 people at the Hibachi table, 2 people at the sushi bar, and about 5 other tables full.  In other words the place was dead.

About 10 minutes after our entree arrived our daughters food arrived and the chicken friend rice was bland and the dumplings were still cold. 

1.5 hours after our arrive we finally got 2 of our 3 sushi rolls and the third about 10 minutes after that.  We enjoyed the first 2 rolls and got the third to go as we were obviously over the experience and not even our daughter who was starving liked her food (she ate what she probably really wanted after we left, McDonalds).

I have a hard time understanding a couple things here.  1)  How does it take 1.5 hours for sushi when the place is dead.  2) Why would you bring our entree our before our appetizer when we clearly wanted the sushi first?  3) When we placed the kids order and said bring that ASAP....does that mean an hour of so later?  

Do not get me wrong.  Besides the chicken fried rice and the frozen dumplings the hibachi and sushi were great but holy lord the service was about as fun as watching Alabama win a National Football Championship (and for an Auburn fan that is not fun).

Sorry EDO, I love your food and maybe you can make it up to me in the future but the service last night was pure crap and a major turn off.  What happened EDO?   What happened?  DISAP...

Oh yeah, oh, the steamed rice and little sauces that normally accompany the hibachi never arrived and when we asked the waitress she knew nothing about them."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"This is a steady option for sushi in Madison.  The prices are fair and it's a consistent good experience.  The service is top notch and if you sit at the sushi bar you'll always get a treat unless they are busy.  Spicy, crunchy yellowtail is one of my fav's."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"I walked in on a Monday, excited to try some of their rolls, as they've got a 50% discount on specialty rolls on Monday.  I placed a take out order for 5 of their rolls, which I carefully selected from their 50% off list.

I took the sushi home and my husband and I hungrily dug in.  And we were disappointed. Gravely.

All 5 of the rolls came slathered with ""house special spicy sauce,"" which is used, I suspect, to cover up the fact that the sushi packed into the rolls is quite far from fresh.

It would be unfair to speculate that this establishment is trying to pack week-old sushi into a discount roll and then hide the week-old fact with extremely flavorful sauce, so I'm not going to accuse them of that.

I *will* say that I won't go back to Edo. Ever. Because their sushi was not good. At all."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi lunch,"If you happen to work out and need to replenish your internal salt supply, AND appreciate over-cooked lobster... and, after letting management know about the issues, attempts to liquor and ice cream you up do not succor you, please eat here at your own risk... This was the worst eating experience I've had in such a long time... Gonna have to have a whole lotta water by the bed tonight...

Also submitted this on Trip Advisor:
""Thank God for the company, who were funny, patient and awesome, because the food SUCKED! As if too much salt and over-cooked seafood weren't bad enough, management thought that a shot and a serving of ice cream could overcome the bad meal and blood pressure waiting to skyrocket amounts of salt from the meal... Somebody call the Dead Sea and let it know where it's missing salt went..."""
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"A few friends and I were craving Sushi while visiting Madison; a friend suggested Edos. 

Upon arrival I was impressed by the interior design of Edo. The restaurant had a very modern Japanese layout. Being a Chicago native where Sushi is easily accessible, I expected more from Edos considering this is one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. 

The Food:

Rolls were priced fairly. 6-9 dollars per roll which contained 6-8 pieces; average price for most dine in sushi 

My order consisted of crunchy salmon roll and a Manhattan Roll. The Manhattan Roll is spicy salmon on the inside topped off with a slice of tuna. The Tuna was thawed and tasted very mushy, almost to the point where it tasted not even fresh. 

The crunchy salmon roll consisted of spicy salmon on the inside, but after eating a few pieces I realized there was little to no salmon and even went to the extent of taking the roll apart to see what was inside; I was right, there was little to no salmon.


The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Our waiter was great, and the restaurant was very clean. The food quality is what ended Edo's with 3 stars. Food quality can be much better considering this is a Japanese Restaurant and one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. 

I will possibly be giving Edo's one more try the next time I visit Madison."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"I have to admit, I'm so glad that I decided to go get sushi with my friends yesterday afternoon here, because my initial impression of Edo Garden from my delivery order wasn't pretty. 

When I ordered delivery from here (which I realize is kind of a gamble with sushi, because it gets to sit in a car for who-knows-how-long and then it's delicate construction can get undone with all the bumps) I wasn't sure what I would get. The order ended up coming within the time range that was promised, but the food was just...........mediocre. The sushi had come undone, the taste was bland/almost too fishy (and I love raw fish sushi!) and the miso soup was kind of gross. So, I had pretty much taken this place off my rotation of sushi places in Madison.

BUT, my experience last night of dining in, in person, actually made me optimistic about coming back! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is pleasing with an almost upscale pan-Asian decor, but not fancy enough where I felt out of place wearing flip-flops and a t-shirt, and the food presentation was wonderful, with the plate types and good quality chop sticks. I ordered 4 rolls, a side of fried gyoza, the miso soup, and two Mai Tai cocktails - and all of them I can say were delightful!

The Mai Tais were strong, fruity, and nicely-sized for $7.50 each - I'll be back just for these! 

The sushi I got definitely had fresh-tasting raw fish on them, and the tempura-based sushi roll I got was light and crisp, and the miso soup was much better dining in than it was via delivery.
Also, when you get delivery, they give you those fake soy sauce packets versus real soy sauce on the table when you dine in, which makes a huge difference for sushi. 

My friends both got the bento boxes for dinner and they had a pretty generous portion of each of the sections and they looked delish - the tempura shrimp pieces were huge!!

Final verdict: definitely will be back, for both the friendly and quick service, and the awesome Mai Tais and delicious food."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"This is one of our two go-to places for sushi -- not perfect, but pretty darn good. (New owners took over a year ago -- ignore older reviews.)

The fish selection is pretty good, and we've never gotten any questionable sushi. (The escolar we had last week was excellent.) The all-you can-eat offer (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday)  is just a ton of fun. 

They haven't developed the volume to be top-notch; the California roll has surimi, not crab, and they don't keep tobiko around. (Love Muramoto's tobiko corral sushi!) 

They are trending now to ""new sushi"" stuff -- oversized rolls in exotic plating, with sauce drizzled all over the place. It's all pretty good if you like that sort of thing. I can always try something out for a chef that wants to push his/her luck a little -- that's my job as a customer. I don't care for many of them, though -- just not my style. So I'm glad they do a darn good job on the basics. 

The regular menu is solid as well; excellent tempura and a donkatsu that works well for this good ol' Midwestern meat and potatoes guy. 

One of these days, we'll ignore the sushi and menu and do the hibachi. The customers around the hibachis all seem to be having a great time."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"Probably the only place in Madison area to get AYCE sushi for one and for under $30 at that makes it better yet. Its not the very best sushi I have ever had before being I am one from San Diego where there is a sushi joint on every corner with real deal master sushi chefs running the place so consider that. Even with that the 12-15 rolls you can pick from are not half bad by any means. I had 9 of them for pete sake! I also had the miso and 2 salads they offer with the buffet and those were a hit. I liked the Golden Dragon, Black Pearl and Sweet Potato Tempura rolls best. Worth a return visit for both wallet and pallet benefit."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"This was my first All You Can Eat Sushi (AYCES) experience, so I don't have much to compare to in that department. From what friends told me, however, the price is good at $25 a person, which include tea/soda, miso soup, and salads. Also, from what I understand, the AYCES ""rules of the house"" are on par with other places. 

We had a group of about 16 people and the restaurant accommodated us quite well. Surprisingly, service was prompt, especially given our large party. Drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time (and the drinks are cheap!!). Miso and salads came out quickly. The sushi itself was tasty and fresh, but not the best that I've eaten in my lifetime.

AYCES rules - each person can order 2 rolls or 10 pieces of sashimi at a time. One must eat all of said pieces before ordering more. If any specialty rolls or sashimi are left on the plate at the end of the meal, you get charged for them. 

AYCES Survival TIP: Go with a group!!! If you don't like something that you ordered, someone else will! If you don't finish a roll, someone else will! 

For all that we ordered, not a bad price at $25 a pop. They even let us bring home the specialty rolls that we did not eat (and were charged for). I was so full that I probably won't want sushi for another year, but I would recommend the experience at least once in a lifetime."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"New owner keeps us coming back.  Was a customer about 7 years ago, horrible service and uncaring owner.  Decided to try it again recently and found it under new ownership.  We got to know the owner by sitting at the sushi bar, very nice man and wants happy customers.  He always remembers us when we come in (once every few months), happily greets us, talks to us, remembers what we like.  His staff is attentive and speaks good English.  Sushi is by far the best sushi in town.  Sushi lunch special is average, I'd like to see more variety on it.  We have tried the hibachi, found we like the value of the competition better (they have dinner for 2 for under $40).  You get a lot for your money at Edo Monona, but it's still pricey for hibachi in my opinion. Badger Roll is our favorite....delish!!!  They used to have a chance to win a free sushi lunch, won it once...wish they'd bring it back, or have a frequent customer club!"
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"This restaurant is great. The prices are very reasonable and the quality is always good. I have dined-in a handful of times but for the take-out lunch specials are where it's at for ""treat yo' self"" days. 

The 2-roll lunch special clocks in at about $11 and includes miso soup and ginger salad. It's perfect. However, if I dine with a friend I like to mix it up and get a vegetable tempura bento box to split (also comes with soup, salad, rice, & dipping sauce) at about $10 it's perfect to share! So if you go the buy & share route, for about $11/person you get miso soup, ginger salad, 4 generous pieces of tempura, rice, and a full roll! It is more than I can eat When fast food meals are almost $8 - your wallet will let you splurge on food that will not last 2 years in a cupboard!"
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"Decent sushi, really lackluster service. 

We waited several minutes to be seated even though there were very few people there (at 7 PM on a Saturday!)--there was no greeter, no one at the front desk. The waitress who finally noticed us and seated us seemed very distracted and rushed.

To start, I ordered hot tea and my boyfriend ordered beer. Our waitress came back with the beer and a water for me because she ""got caught up in something and forgot"" what I ordered. Not only that, but during our 1 1/2 hour stay, she never once refilled my tea or asked either of us if we wanted another drink. 

My boyfriend ordered the Sushi Deluxe, which comes with an assortment of nigiri plus a roll. His meal came without the roll, and when he asked the waitress about it, she seemed confused, then consulted a menu before realizing he was right. 

His order came a good 10 minutes before mine, and while I understand that not everything will be ready at the same time, I would not expect to wait that long. And then it was a while longer before the forgotten roll came out. 

Towards the end of our meal, we overheard another waitress apologizing to another party about something, which, after having OUR waitress apologize several times for mistakes, didn't instill much confidence in the overall management of the place.

It's too bad, because we both enjoyed the sushi. And the menu seems more extensive than some other places in town. But with slow service, multiple mistakes, no drink refills, and the sense that it was a management issue, not just one waitress making mistakes or having an off day, this will not be our first choice for sushi in the future."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"Such a disappointing place. It's meant for undergrads or folks who don't really care about the quality of food. That said, you don't really get quantity here either.

The only saving grace of the place was the sweet potato sushi. The sweet potato was fried and wrapped like a california roll. Good job!

Other items I've had were all disappointing. And sadly my friend had an upset stomach after getting sushi. So folks, the freshness of sashimi here is doubtful. I also usually get the nabeyaki udon, thinking that cooked food will be safe. There was nothing interesting in the udon. The ingredients were overcooked and tasteless. No, not even when I'm sick will I want to eat it.

Service was minimal, and they are run by Chinese, not Japanese. So I guess you can't expect much from them. 

Yeah, I only came here for the Savor Taste Race and it reminded me of the low quality food I used to have when I was an undergrad. No more visiting Edo, I'm done!"
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"We came here as a group of 20 for a birthday party. Magically they were able to set all of us up in the hibachi rooms. 

As people arrived, the bartender was able to keep pace with the drink orders and everyone was well watered. 
They make a very good long island. 

The birthday girl got the famous ceremonial chef's hat and everyone was whisked into the hibachi room. 

They gave us ample time to order and came back to check on drinks. We got two chefs who kept our non-PC crowd entertained, as well as contained. 

I ordered the Shrimp Tempura bento box $15.95 because I wasn't in the mood for hibachi, because let's face it, part of what you're paying for is the show and I'm already getting that for free. It came with four pieces of California roll and shrimp shumai, two pieces of shrimp tempura, assorted vegetable tempura, rice, house salad, and miso soup. The tempura dipping broth was not your typical dashi broth, instead it tasted like watered down soy sauce. A huge pet peeve of mine is shrimp that isn't devined, as this was the case. The rest were okay, but it left something to be desired as I was picking at other peoples plates after my meal. 

The hibachi show was great, did the volcano, plastic squirt doll,  and egg show. 

As a birthday gift, they gave a free shot of an top-shelf, aged sake which was presented by the Manger, which I feel is a nice touch. 

If you're looking for an accommodating restaurant with a polite and pleasant staff, this is a good spot."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"went here for a work lunch.  the food was a bit slow but, worth the wait.  I had the Tempura Odun - quite yummy."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"If you are a sushi connoisseur this is not the place for you.  Cheap sushi, no frills, lots of roll choices.  The service was clearly lacking as no one manned the hostess stand, the wait staff was spread thin and by one waitress's own admission the kitchen staff was short also.  That being said, my food came out fast and everyone was very nice.  This is likely a place the neighborhood goes to as there were plenty of high schoolers there as well as some college kids.  If you want basic, one step up from grocery store sushi, this place will do.  $21.00 for 12 pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll.  I still wouldn't return."
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"No too sure why I didn't like this place. Food was salty and a little on the cool side. That being said, our waitress was awesome! Super friendly and nice, and even for 6pm on a Tuesday, it was dead. 

We had the platters of spring roll and noodles with soup - and I was disappointed with the salty food and the lack of real taste. Everything was just ""ok"" - nothing stood out to me. I've had better rice and better veggies. Everything seemed to be heavy, and swam in oil. I was hoping for a better experience - oh, well. Maybe the Park Street location is the place to go......"
Edo Garden Monona,sweet potato tempura roll,"I have no idea why Edo would have only three stars! It's definitely not five-star Japanese cuisine but everything we ordered was great, and exactly what we were expecting. We got a few different vegetable sushi, the spicy tuna roll, gyoza, chicken teriyaki and vegetable tempura, which I have to say they do really well here! Not heavy or oily which means they're frying at the proper temperature. The prices were also great for all the food we ordered for four adults and a child, and the atmosphere was just really nice and quiet, with great service from a very nice and efficient waitress."

Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi combo,"Overall, not a terrible experience. I prefer Takumi on almost all fronts, however. From the miso to the sushi. Some of the more specialty rolls here may be good, but I haven't tried them (they were a bit expensive for my tastes, so i skipped over them quickly). The Tokyo roll and tuna roll I ordered were good but not amazing. The fish was too room-temperature for my tastes, almost a bit gaggy, actually. The miso tasted like it was missing something, salt, maybe? I don't know, but I didn't finish it, and I usually can't get enough miso.

Three stars (instead of my gut-instinct of 2) because the service was actually excellent. The waiter gave me a lunch special even though one of the rolls I ordered was not supposed to be eligible for the combo, and was extremely attentive and friendly. Though, I was one of only two tables in the place over an after-lunchtime lull, so that may have had something to do with it, as well as me being a not-too-terribly-hideous woman eating by myself...come to think of it, he was probably hitting on me the whole time and i was just sitting there thinking, ""dang, the service here is excellent!""  dummy me...

If sushi is the menu of choice, i'll be at takumi, hands down. and I'll have to agree with Aftee in one of the other reviews: the empty pond thing right as you walk in the door is a little off-putting."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi combo,"Have always had great food and service from Edo Garden in Monona. Had take-out sushi multiple times and always delicious and fresh. The best Hibachi night with Chef TJ, awesome time.!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi combo,"This is the best sushi I've found in Madison so far  -- with excellent customer service.

Sushi options here in Madison seem pretty limited to me, but Edo is the best I've found so far, the quality of service, sushi and ambiance put it over the much-hyped, but underwhelming Takumi on all counts.  The sushi selections are very tasty and very fresh.  Prices are reasonable for sushi.  The private tea rooms are great options for a quiet romantic evening.

I can't really say anything about the hibachi dining or any of the other non-sushi fare since all I've tasted is the sushi, but my companions on my visits all  liked what they had.

The service here is always impeccable, some of the best I've had since moving to Madison."

The entrees are always fresh and most are quite tasty. I did have one with wide, flat rice noodles that had been cooked into mush in a bean sauce, but the sushi, noodles, and teriyaki are all great. The hibachi was fun the first time, but got old pretty quick and the food there is bland and oily (though, obviously, very fresh). 

The ambiance is simple and classy - the kind you don't really notice because you're there for the food and the company. Excellent for a big group! I think the place is just not trendy enough to attract the hipster crowd who frequent other Japanese places in town. Again, fine by me."

I really hate writing this review because in the past we have had such great experiences at EDO and this review is not about the food because the Sushi and Hibachi are good food.  But the service...WHOA!

Picture it...Valentines Day and my wife and almost 2 year old want a nice dinner.   We debated many nice places but with the child they can be difficult at times so we decided some Sushi and Hibachi is nice, quick and delicious.  So we plan a early arrival at a place we have been to before...EDO!  When we arrive the place is almost empty and we get one of the private dining rooms.

Sushi Rolls are ordered as an appetizer. Dumplings and chicken fried rice are ordered are ordered for our daughter to come out with the appetizers.  And a Hibachi meal to split for my wife and I as an entree. And....we wait.

After 50 minutes still no food.  Ok, starting to get annoyed.  1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting and here come our sush....nope.  it is our Hibachi entree.  WTF?  Really?  I was explained by the waitress that they had an influx of orders and were really behind.  Hmmmm, ok...so I decided to scope out the scene because they obviously had many patrons arrive after we did.  Not so much, because the place had maybe 2 people at the Hibachi table, 2 people at the sushi bar, and about 5 other tables full.  In other words the place was dead.

About 10 minutes after our entree arrived our daughters food arrived and the chicken friend rice was bland and the dumplings were still cold. 

1.5 hours after our arrive we finally got 2 of our 3 sushi rolls and the third about 10 minutes after that.  We enjoyed the first 2 rolls and got the third to go as we were obviously over the experience and not even our daughter who was starving liked her food (she ate what she probably really wanted after we left, McDonalds).

I have a hard time understanding a couple things here.  1)  How does it take 1.5 hours for sushi when the place is dead.  2) Why would you bring our entree our before our appetizer when we clearly wanted the sushi first?  3) When we placed the kids order and said bring that ASAP....does that mean an hour of so later?  

Do not get me wrong.  Besides the chicken fried rice and the frozen dumplings the hibachi and sushi were great but holy lord the service was about as fun as watching Alabama win a National Football Championship (and for an Auburn fan that is not fun).

Sorry EDO, I love your food and maybe you can make it up to me in the future but the service last night was pure crap and a major turn off.  What happened EDO?   What happened?  DISAP...

Oh yeah, oh, the steamed rice and little sauces that normally accompany the hibachi never arrived and when we asked the waitress she knew nothing about them."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi combo,"This is a steady option for sushi in Madison.  The prices are fair and it's a consistent good experience.  The service is top notch and if you sit at the sushi bar you'll always get a treat unless they are busy.  Spicy, crunchy yellowtail is one of my fav's."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi combo,"I walked in on a Monday, excited to try some of their rolls, as they've got a 50% discount on specialty rolls on Monday.  I placed a take out order for 5 of their rolls, which I carefully selected from their 50% off list.

I took the sushi home and my husband and I hungrily dug in.  And we were disappointed. Gravely.

All 5 of the rolls came slathered with ""house special spicy sauce,"" which is used, I suspect, to cover up the fact that the sushi packed into the rolls is quite far from fresh.

It would be unfair to speculate that this establishment is trying to pack week-old sushi into a discount roll and then hide the week-old fact with extremely flavorful sauce, so I'm not going to accuse them of that.

I *will* say that I won't go back to Edo. Ever. Because their sushi was not good. At all."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi and sashimi combo,"If you happen to work out and need to replenish your internal salt supply, AND appreciate over-cooked lobster... and, after letting management know about the issues, attempts to liquor and ice cream you up do not succor you, please eat here at your own risk... This was the worst eating experience I've had in such a long time... Gonna have to have a whole lotta water by the bed tonight...

Also submitted this on Trip Advisor:
""Thank God for the company, who were funny, patient and awesome, because the food SUCKED! As if too much salt and over-cooked seafood weren't bad enough, management thought that a shot and a serving of ice cream could overcome the bad meal and blood pressure waiting to skyrocket amounts of salt from the meal... Somebody call the Dead Sea and let it know where it's missing salt went..."""
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"A few friends and I were craving Sushi while visiting Madison; a friend suggested Edos. 

Upon arrival I was impressed by the interior design of Edo. The restaurant had a very modern Japanese layout. Being a Chicago native where Sushi is easily accessible, I expected more from Edos considering this is one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. 

The Food:

Rolls were priced fairly. 6-9 dollars per roll which contained 6-8 pieces; average price for most dine in sushi 

My order consisted of crunchy salmon roll and a Manhattan Roll. The Manhattan Roll is spicy salmon on the inside topped off with a slice of tuna. The Tuna was thawed and tasted very mushy, almost to the point where it tasted not even fresh. 

The crunchy salmon roll consisted of spicy salmon on the inside, but after eating a few pieces I realized there was little to no salmon and even went to the extent of taking the roll apart to see what was inside; I was right, there was little to no salmon.


The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Our waiter was great, and the restaurant was very clean. The food quality is what ended Edo's with 3 stars. Food quality can be much better considering this is a Japanese Restaurant and one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison. 

I will possibly be giving Edo's one more try the next time I visit Madison."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"I have to admit, I'm so glad that I decided to go get sushi with my friends yesterday afternoon here, because my initial impression of Edo Garden from my delivery order wasn't pretty. 

When I ordered delivery from here (which I realize is kind of a gamble with sushi, because it gets to sit in a car for who-knows-how-long and then it's delicate construction can get undone with all the bumps) I wasn't sure what I would get. The order ended up coming within the time range that was promised, but the food was just...........mediocre. The sushi had come undone, the taste was bland/almost too fishy (and I love raw fish sushi!) and the miso soup was kind of gross. So, I had pretty much taken this place off my rotation of sushi places in Madison.

BUT, my experience last night of dining in, in person, actually made me optimistic about coming back! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is pleasing with an almost upscale pan-Asian decor, but not fancy enough where I felt out of place wearing flip-flops and a t-shirt, and the food presentation was wonderful, with the plate types and good quality chop sticks. I ordered 4 rolls, a side of fried gyoza, the miso soup, and two Mai Tai cocktails - and all of them I can say were delightful!

The Mai Tais were strong, fruity, and nicely-sized for $7.50 each - I'll be back just for these! 

The sushi I got definitely had fresh-tasting raw fish on them, and the tempura-based sushi roll I got was light and crisp, and the miso soup was much better dining in than it was via delivery.
Also, when you get delivery, they give you those fake soy sauce packets versus real soy sauce on the table when you dine in, which makes a huge difference for sushi. 

My friends both got the bento boxes for dinner and they had a pretty generous portion of each of the sections and they looked delish - the tempura shrimp pieces were huge!!

Final verdict: definitely will be back, for both the friendly and quick service, and the awesome Mai Tais and delicious food."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"This is the best sushi around Madison!! We love the place, which is really well decorated. The habachi might be a bit slow but its worth it. The chef was soooo funny and entertained us well. We had a great night. Our waitress was sweet and helpful. Definitely would come again."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"This is one of our two go-to places for sushi -- not perfect, but pretty darn good. (New owners took over a year ago -- ignore older reviews.)

The fish selection is pretty good, and we've never gotten any questionable sushi. (The escolar we had last week was excellent.) The all-you can-eat offer (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday)  is just a ton of fun. 

They haven't developed the volume to be top-notch; the California roll has surimi, not crab, and they don't keep tobiko around. (Love Muramoto's tobiko corral sushi!) 

They are trending now to ""new sushi"" stuff -- oversized rolls in exotic plating, with sauce drizzled all over the place. It's all pretty good if you like that sort of thing. I can always try something out for a chef that wants to push his/her luck a little -- that's my job as a customer. I don't care for many of them, though -- just not my style. So I'm glad they do a darn good job on the basics. 

The regular menu is solid as well; excellent tempura and a donkatsu that works well for this good ol' Midwestern meat and potatoes guy. 

One of these days, we'll ignore the sushi and menu and do the hibachi. The customers around the hibachis all seem to be having a great time."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Probably the only place in Madison area to get AYCE sushi for one and for under $30 at that makes it better yet. Its not the very best sushi I have ever had before being I am one from San Diego where there is a sushi joint on every corner with real deal master sushi chefs running the place so consider that. Even with that the 12-15 rolls you can pick from are not half bad by any means. I had 9 of them for pete sake! I also had the miso and 2 salads they offer with the buffet and those were a hit. I liked the Golden Dragon, Black Pearl and Sweet Potato Tempura rolls best. Worth a return visit for both wallet and pallet benefit."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"We visited here with a group of 6 for dinner. The sushi was good, but not the best I've had. If you're in Monona and need a sushi fix, you'll be fine. The Hibachi was really salty and not something I'd go for again. It didn't have much to it besides the sauce.

Service was ok, a little slow but attentive."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Overall, not a terrible experience. I prefer Takumi on almost all fronts, however. From the miso to the sushi. Some of the more specialty rolls here may be good, but I haven't tried them (they were a bit expensive for my tastes, so i skipped over them quickly). The Tokyo roll and tuna roll I ordered were good but not amazing. The fish was too room-temperature for my tastes, almost a bit gaggy, actually. The miso tasted like it was missing something, salt, maybe? I don't know, but I didn't finish it, and I usually can't get enough miso.

Three stars (instead of my gut-instinct of 2) because the service was actually excellent. The waiter gave me a lunch special even though one of the rolls I ordered was not supposed to be eligible for the combo, and was extremely attentive and friendly. Though, I was one of only two tables in the place over an after-lunchtime lull, so that may have had something to do with it, as well as me being a not-too-terribly-hideous woman eating by myself...come to think of it, he was probably hitting on me the whole time and i was just sitting there thinking, ""dang, the service here is excellent!""  dummy me...

If sushi is the menu of choice, i'll be at takumi, hands down. and I'll have to agree with Aftee in one of the other reviews: the empty pond thing right as you walk in the door is a little off-putting."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Have always had great food and service from Edo Garden in Monona. Had take-out sushi multiple times and always delicious and fresh. The best Hibachi night with Chef TJ, awesome time.!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,Edo Japanese Restaurant on Monona drive is such an awesome place! Their sushi is amazing every single time we go there. One of our favorite things is the Kani salad! Yum! Their hibachi dinners are great too and entertaining with fire and juggling! Their chefs and waitstaff are always super friendly! They have some great lunch specials too for a good price. I highly recommend this place!
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"This is the best sushi I've found in Madison so far  -- with excellent customer service.

Sushi options here in Madison seem pretty limited to me, but Edo is the best I've found so far, the quality of service, sushi and ambiance put it over the much-hyped, but underwhelming Takumi on all counts.  The sushi selections are very tasty and very fresh.  Prices are reasonable for sushi.  The private tea rooms are great options for a quiet romantic evening.

I can't really say anything about the hibachi dining or any of the other non-sushi fare since all I've tasted is the sushi, but my companions on my visits all  liked what they had.

The service here is always impeccable, some of the best I've had since moving to Madison."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Our go-to take out sushi restaurant.  The sushi and sashimi selection is exceptional.  There is a lot to choose from.  However, the service could improve."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,Good.  Not great.  Very consistent and attentive service.  If you need sushi and a seaweed salad it is the place to go.
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"My dinner experiences at Edo have been very mixed of late.  The service remains generally good, but the quality of the sushi is quite variable.

Their bento lunches are a wonderful change of pace if you can't make it downtown to Red."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"This was my first All You Can Eat Sushi (AYCES) experience, so I don't have much to compare to in that department. From what friends told me, however, the price is good at $25 a person, which include tea/soda, miso soup, and salads. Also, from what I understand, the AYCES ""rules of the house"" are on par with other places. 

We had a group of about 16 people and the restaurant accommodated us quite well. Surprisingly, service was prompt, especially given our large party. Drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time (and the drinks are cheap!!). Miso and salads came out quickly. The sushi itself was tasty and fresh, but not the best that I've eaten in my lifetime.

AYCES rules - each person can order 2 rolls or 10 pieces of sashimi at a time. One must eat all of said pieces before ordering more. If any specialty rolls or sashimi are left on the plate at the end of the meal, you get charged for them. 

AYCES Survival TIP: Go with a group!!! If you don't like something that you ordered, someone else will! If you don't finish a roll, someone else will! 

For all that we ordered, not a bad price at $25 a pop. They even let us bring home the specialty rolls that we did not eat (and were charged for). I was so full that I probably won't want sushi for another year, but I would recommend the experience at least once in a lifetime."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"New owner keeps us coming back.  Was a customer about 7 years ago, horrible service and uncaring owner.  Decided to try it again recently and found it under new ownership.  We got to know the owner by sitting at the sushi bar, very nice man and wants happy customers.  He always remembers us when we come in (once every few months), happily greets us, talks to us, remembers what we like.  His staff is attentive and speaks good English.  Sushi is by far the best sushi in town.  Sushi lunch special is average, I'd like to see more variety on it.  We have tried the hibachi, found we like the value of the competition better (they have dinner for 2 for under $40).  You get a lot for your money at Edo Monona, but it's still pricey for hibachi in my opinion. Badger Roll is our favorite....delish!!!  They used to have a chance to win a free sushi lunch, won it once...wish they'd bring it back, or have a frequent customer club!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Nice friendly service, horrible, horrible sushi. The rice was gooey like rice pudding. We were hungry enough to finish the various old and tough fish pieces, but we're paying for it today,, very sick. Never again."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Definitely won't be visiting this place again. We had our own tea room, which was a plus since we had our 8 month old with us, but beyond that we weren't happy with our experience. The room was dirty and the service was poor. We were there early and there were only a few other diners there but my husbands sushi order took so long we nearly left instead of waiting. I had already eaten my entire hibachi dinner before he got his meal. He did say the sushi was decent, and they had a nice looking bar, so I mustered two stars for the review, but we are new to the area and will be trying other Japanese places instead."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Decent sushi, really lackluster service. 

We waited several minutes to be seated even though there were very few people there (at 7 PM on a Saturday!)--there was no greeter, no one at the front desk. The waitress who finally noticed us and seated us seemed very distracted and rushed.

To start, I ordered hot tea and my boyfriend ordered beer. Our waitress came back with the beer and a water for me because she ""got caught up in something and forgot"" what I ordered. Not only that, but during our 1 1/2 hour stay, she never once refilled my tea or asked either of us if we wanted another drink. 

My boyfriend ordered the Sushi Deluxe, which comes with an assortment of nigiri plus a roll. His meal came without the roll, and when he asked the waitress about it, she seemed confused, then consulted a menu before realizing he was right. 

His order came a good 10 minutes before mine, and while I understand that not everything will be ready at the same time, I would not expect to wait that long. And then it was a while longer before the forgotten roll came out. 

Towards the end of our meal, we overheard another waitress apologizing to another party about something, which, after having OUR waitress apologize several times for mistakes, didn't instill much confidence in the overall management of the place.

It's too bad, because we both enjoyed the sushi. And the menu seems more extensive than some other places in town. But with slow service, multiple mistakes, no drink refills, and the sense that it was a management issue, not just one waitress making mistakes or having an off day, this will not be our first choice for sushi in the future."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"So i've been here a few times. I want to like this place because its close to my work & home. So i figured I would try one last time and hope to really like Edo. Sorry.. but I am just not a big fan of the sushi here..  It just seems as if its missing something... Same with the beef yakisoba it had no spice.. no pizzaz. 

Another thing that was ""missing"" in my last carry out order was the darn CHOPSTICKS?  Come on isn't that the norm to get some sticks with your take out order?  Oh.. wait I got a couple plastic forks! Maybe someone is trying to save a few bucks.. but next time ask me if i want a fork or chopsticks?  I need those suckers. Especially at the rate the sushi is going for.

One more thing..  I am just wondering what's up with the ""pond"" thats drained? Its on the left when you walk into the building? Can't miss it.. Someone please fill that sucker up with some water and koi fish!  Its been empty since the first time I dined there years ago. That would add a little flare to the rather empty feeling when you first walk in..."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Such a disappointing place. It's meant for undergrads or folks who don't really care about the quality of food. That said, you don't really get quantity here either.

The only saving grace of the place was the sweet potato sushi. The sweet potato was fried and wrapped like a california roll. Good job!

Other items I've had were all disappointing. And sadly my friend had an upset stomach after getting sushi. So folks, the freshness of sashimi here is doubtful. I also usually get the nabeyaki udon, thinking that cooked food will be safe. There was nothing interesting in the udon. The ingredients were overcooked and tasteless. No, not even when I'm sick will I want to eat it.

Service was minimal, and they are run by Chinese, not Japanese. So I guess you can't expect much from them. 

Yeah, I only came here for the Savor Taste Race and it reminded me of the low quality food I used to have when I was an undergrad. No more visiting Edo, I'm done!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"My god, reading the reviews on yelp for this place prompted me to hurry up and review it too.  The sushi here is JUST okay.  It's not exactly cheap either.  But it feels overpriced for what you're getting.

I also don't care for the ambiance.  The private tea rooms are nice, but if you don't sit in one of them, it just feels like you're in this big empty room.

The last time I ate here, they accidentally added an extra entree to our bill. So, when we were paying, we thought it seemed kind of expensive, and we barely had enough cash to cover it.  We finally realized what the problem was after our waitress complained to my sister that she didn't leave a big enough tip.  They seemed more upset about the tip than the fact that they overcharged us by $9.

I dunno, I guess if i were desperate for sushi, and happened to be in Monona, I'd eat here again, but otherwise I doubt it."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Pretty darn good, actually. We've been here 10 or 15 times and love it. Apparently we have unusual tastes because it's always empty, but that's just fine by me - never a wait, we can sit wherever we want, and the service is always good.

The entrees are always fresh and most are quite tasty. I did have one with wide, flat rice noodles that had been cooked into mush in a bean sauce, but the sushi, noodles, and teriyaki are all great. The hibachi was fun the first time, but got old pretty quick and the food there is bland and oily (though, obviously, very fresh). 

The ambiance is simple and classy - the kind you don't really notice because you're there for the food and the company. Excellent for a big group! I think the place is just not trendy enough to attract the hipster crowd who frequent other Japanese places in town. Again, fine by me."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Great place! We had a large group for a birthday with various likes and dislikes. Everyone was accomodated. The sushi was fantastic. One member of the party had the tofu. It was divine. Service was great, and it was a vast improvement over the run down Ginzas. We plan on going again and again."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"This is officially my new favorite sushi place, which pisses me off to no end because it's over an hour away from my house. Bring me a Milwaukee location and I'll probably singlehandedly keep it in business!"
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Came here on a Friday night. The tiny parking lot was packed, but inside was not as packed. Ordered a few vegetable rolls and seaweed salad. The avocado roll was extremely flavorless, service was ok. One person in our dinner party was given the wrong food because the waitstaff ordered the wrong food for her. Edo on Park St has always been pretty tasty. It's sad that Monona isn't just as good. The sushi rice tasted like it didn't have any vinegar added...it was just plain rice."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"We've been here twice, and both times were to take advantage of the all-you-can-eat sushi. It's a great deal, but the key thing to remember is that you have to pay for anything you don't eat.

Here's a ranking of our favorite rolls -- mostly just for posterity -- Z Roll, Sweet American, Fuji Roll, Crazy Dragon, Black Pearl, Tiger Roll."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"I started out with the Edo on Park Street a number of years ago, and was happy to see they'd opened a second location. The Monona venue is rarely super-busy, and thus generally quieter than its Madison sibling. 

Sushi is of decent quality for what's available in the Midwest; not the best in the area, but FAR from the worst. I'd call it solid and reasonably-priced. 

Service can be somewhat mixed - it's been inattentive/slow at times, and fine at others. I wouldn't pick this place (unless you got takeout) if you were in a rush."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"If you are a sushi connoisseur this is not the place for you.  Cheap sushi, no frills, lots of roll choices.  The service was clearly lacking as no one manned the hostess stand, the wait staff was spread thin and by one waitress's own admission the kitchen staff was short also.  That being said, my food came out fast and everyone was very nice.  This is likely a place the neighborhood goes to as there were plenty of high schoolers there as well as some college kids.  If you want basic, one step up from grocery store sushi, this place will do.  $21.00 for 12 pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll.  I still wouldn't return."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"When I say DISAP you say POINTED. Disappointed!  Disappointed!  I really hate writing this review because in the past we have had such great experiences at EDO and this review is not about the food because the Sushi and Hibachi are good food.  But the service...WHOA!

Picture it...Valentines Day and my wife and almost 2 year old want a nice dinner.   We debated many nice places but with the child they can be difficult at times so we decided some Sushi and Hibachi is nice, quick and delicious.  So we plan a early arrival at a place we have been to before...EDO!  When we arrive the place is almost empty and we get one of the private dining rooms.

Sushi Rolls are ordered as an appetizer. Dumplings and chicken fried rice are ordered are ordered for our daughter to come out with the appetizers.  And a Hibachi meal to split for my wife and I as an entree. And....we wait.

After 50 minutes still no food.  Ok, starting to get annoyed.  1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting and here come our sush....nope.  it is our Hibachi entree.  WTF?  Really?  I was explained by the waitress that they had an influx of orders and were really behind.  Hmmmm, ok...so I decided to scope out the scene because they obviously had many patrons arrive after we did.  Not so much, because the place had maybe 2 people at the Hibachi table, 2 people at the sushi bar, and about 5 other tables full.  In other words the place was dead.

About 10 minutes after our entree arrived our daughters food arrived and the chicken friend rice was bland and the dumplings were still cold. 

1.5 hours after our arrive we finally got 2 of our 3 sushi rolls and the third about 10 minutes after that.  We enjoyed the first 2 rolls and got the third to go as we were obviously over the experience and not even our daughter who was starving liked her food (she ate what she probably really wanted after we left, McDonalds).

I have a hard time understanding a couple things here.  1)  How does it take 1.5 hours for sushi when the place is dead.  2) Why would you bring our entree our before our appetizer when we clearly wanted the sushi first?  3) When we placed the kids order and said bring that ASAP....does that mean an hour of so later?  

Do not get me wrong.  Besides the chicken fried rice and the frozen dumplings the hibachi and sushi were great but holy lord the service was about as fun as watching Alabama win a National Football Championship (and for an Auburn fan that is not fun).

Sorry EDO, I love your food and maybe you can make it up to me in the future but the service last night was pure crap and a major turn off.  What happened EDO?   What happened?  DISAP...

Oh yeah, oh, the steamed rice and little sauces that normally accompany the hibachi never arrived and when we asked the waitress she knew nothing about them."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Edo Garden was quite a disappointment. I've been a huge fan of hibachi-style Japanese food for most of my life. We recently moved to Monona and decided to take visiting relatives there for dinner. While the staff went out of their way to accommodate our party, the rest of the service was mediocre. Our hibachi chef was sub-par. Part of the hibachi experience is the entertainment factor of watching the chef's fancy, fast work with his tools on the grill. Our chef was unable to perform. He also spoke no English at all, which caused some confusion with our steak preferences. Finally, the food itself was just not what I've come to expect from a hibachi grill. The flavors were not very good. Everything was cooked mostly in butter. The miso soup was very good, but all of the actual grilled food, not so much. Our server brought out a plate of ice cream, whipped cream, and drizzled chocolate, which my young daughter and I enjoyed. I'm not sure why and I don't think we were charged for it, but it was a very nice gesture. I may go back sometime and give their sushi a try, but I think I'll go back down to Janesville or Rockford for my hibachi grill fix."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Kids had a sushi fix. Edo was on the way home.  Had Edo on Park Street last month (wouldn't be going there again).  Thought, let's give the Monona  location a try for dinner.

We were seated in the tea room.  Filthy, sticky table,  wall was pealing and if you look up at the ceiling pretty gross.  

Food was mediocre.  Ordered the dragon roll & eel roll( could use more eel sauce) & vegetable soba was just ok.  The sushi was bland-rice needed more vinegar & sugar mix.  Will not be returning any time soon."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,Great hibachi food and good sushi.  The restaurant is always clean and the staff are friendly.
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"This is a steady option for sushi in Madison.  The prices are fair and it's a consistent good experience.  The service is top notch and if you sit at the sushi bar you'll always get a treat unless they are busy.  Spicy, crunchy yellowtail is one of my fav's."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Been here a few times before and I always thought it was solid. This last experience, however, was not good. Really not good. I couldn't even finish my bowl of miso soup. It was so sour (I didn't think miso could go bad?) and had just a few pieces of the saddest seaweed and tofu. As far as the sushi, they seem to have an affinity for the mayonnaise-y drizzle over everything. I don't really respect that approach in the first place and they really take it to an extreme here.  
Finally - the cardinal sin. They used imitation crab meat in the California roll. This may be a reason why we were the only people in there."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"I have no idea why Edo would have only three stars! It's definitely not five-star Japanese cuisine but everything we ordered was great, and exactly what we were expecting. We got a few different vegetable sushi, the spicy tuna roll, gyoza, chicken teriyaki and vegetable tempura, which I have to say they do really well here! Not heavy or oily which means they're frying at the proper temperature. The prices were also great for all the food we ordered for four adults and a child, and the atmosphere was just really nice and quiet, with great service from a very nice and efficient waitress."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"I walked in on a Monday, excited to try some of their rolls, as they've got a 50% discount on specialty rolls on Monday.  I placed a take out order for 5 of their rolls, which I carefully selected from their 50% off list.

I took the sushi home and my husband and I hungrily dug in.  And we were disappointed. Gravely.

All 5 of the rolls came slathered with ""house special spicy sauce,"" which is used, I suspect, to cover up the fact that the sushi packed into the rolls is quite far from fresh.

It would be unfair to speculate that this establishment is trying to pack week-old sushi into a discount roll and then hide the week-old fact with extremely flavorful sauce, so I'm not going to accuse them of that.

I *will* say that I won't go back to Edo. Ever. Because their sushi was not good. At all."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"When I am eating raw fish I expect the place I am eating it from to be immaculate or I start getting a little freaked out.The place needs a remodel; the floor was uneven, the tables and chairs banged up, and there was also a gnat that wouldn't leave me alone. All of this lead to me thinking/feeling is this sushi safe to be eating!?. The place really needs some TLC! The menu was big. I liked that they had pictures of the specialty rolls. When the sushi came it was all good but nothing to write home about. Prices were reasonable."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"Oops, I was at this Edo not the one in Madison.
Our new favorite place to go for hibachi in the Madison area. 
My wife, three kids and myself decided to go there at the last minute. There was no wait and it was a Saturday night, so I was a little nervous. I read the other reviews and didn't know what to expect. We sat down and ordered drinks. It took a little time to get but that would be the only negative of the whole night. Our chef was so much fun. We all had different dinners and everyone really enjoyed what they had, not an easy task for five people. The price wasn't bad and the service was excellent.
I can't speak about sushi except to say that I don't like sushi. The hibachi though is great."
Edo Garden Monona,sushi,"I went to Edo a couple weeks ago with friends. 

First lets start with the restaurant. Nice ambiance. We had a private room. So cool! 

I got the avocado salad. Yum! I was not super impressed with the ginger house dressing, which is usually one of my favorites at places like this. I got hot tea - yummy and perfect on a cold night! I can't remember exactly which roll I got, but it was good. They a have a lot to choose from and run specials throughout the week. 

Service was good. Overall a good place. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but a good restaurant overall."
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"Not happy with the service I received, I had ordered extra tomatoes and got none on my sub. This is the third time I've gotten delivery from this specific location, and the second time I've had an improperly prepared order. It's not that hard to make a sandwich properly!"
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"So ever time i have ordered from them  i get a soggy mash sub, or the order is wrong, my friend just got fucked over by them never got delivered still got charged for it got told to get fucked by the manager. This place is a shit hole will never order from them again and will definitely tell everyone to go to fire house instead."
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,the sub was good the guy behind the counter not so good. a bit rude honestly.clean place. good music playing
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"Ok... Here we go... Bread? Awful. Meats? Horrible. Service? Non-existent. WHY ARE THEY ARE STILL IN BUSINESS?!?!?!?! Late night delivery.

THAT IS IT. I have ordered from here a ton of times and every time is the same... Late night but disgusting... Last night was the last straw... It is the worst sub shop in Madison. 

That is all."
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"I needed a quick lunch at 10:30 on a Sunday morning and my trusty Yelp app indicated Silver Mine Subs was open for business, so I hopped into the Manlander and made the 3-minute trip to grab some sustenance.  

When I arrived, I was the only customer in the store (not surprising, as Silver Mine probably is not on the top of anyone's list for Sunday brunch).  The store is clean and well maintained.  While the staff not overly enthusiastic, they efficiently cranked out my order in less than two minutes.  

My Homestake sandwich (Angus Philly Cheese steak, provolone cheese, green peppers & red onion) was typical sub shop fare.  While the bread did not provide very much flavor, the bread to filling ratio was spot on.  The two-inch strips of raw red onion were extremely pungent and overwhelmed the other flavors.  I also was not a fan of the raw green pepper strips - meh.  A proper Philly Cheese steak needs sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms, not these raw veggies.  Another disappointment was the warmed but not melted slice of provolone cheese on the bottom of the sandwich - double meh.  The meat was well seasoned and generously portioned.  There a couple gristly bites, but overall, I enjoyed this component of the sandwich the most.  

While not a culinary extravaganza, I did enjoy Homestake sandwich eminently more than the horrific pastrami melt (shudder) I recently endured at Subway.  However, it paled in comparison to the sublime Philly Cheese steak sandwich I enjoyed at the nearby Parkway Family Restaurant.  So will I return to Silver Mine?  My gustatory Magic Eight Ball indicates ""Reply Hazy, try again.""

Other observations and ramblings:
* Silver Mine was a Belly loyalty reward.  With my initial visit and subsequent liking their Facebook page, I became eligible for a free cookie during my next visit.
* Signing up for their e-mail club gets you a coupon for a free small sub.
* There currently is a 10% check-in offer on Yelp.
* You can order ahead online, which is convenient if you are pressed for time."
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"So I got an message from Ken the same day I posted this review. He apologized and said ""I could definitely put a free medium sub credit on your account and encourage you to try us again?  Thank you for the feedback!""

I responding telling him I would try again today.... I guess I will update again later.

Once I got over the fact that a hot sub would not be hot (its warm), and the size is not the same as most sub shops. It wasn't great, but it wasnt bad. So I will upgrade it to three stars. 
I have to admit that some of the options are a nice change of pace from the usual places I order for lunch. Hopefully they can make some changes in the future."
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,Much improved an continuing too improve sub shop .. Good Subs! .. Love the hours & the staff cares to custom make orders. They offer great suggestions too.
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"I have ordered from here twice, and got two sandwiches each time ( one for that day and one for the next day). First time was ok, but the Italian type sub had way to much oil on it. It was just an oily mess and tasted awful. The chicken one was great though in a tortilla. The delivery time was lengthy but not terribly bad. About 45 min. 

The second time I order  (today) was ridiculous! I forgot my lunch today and was super busy so I ordered my super late lunch at 3:30 pm. I didn't get my food till 5 pm!! An hour and a half delivery time! It was supposed to be 45-60 min delivery time, which I find fair in Madison, but 1 1/2 hrs come on!!! So mad! I could have drive there and back in that time a couple times!....at least the wrap I got was good and hopefully the one for tomorrow is fine to, but they need more drivers or something. That wait time was ridiculous!"
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"Good subs. I wish they had a vegetarian meatball sub. That would be sweet. But I digress, I love the late night delivery. They are quick and always get the order right. Their cookies and pickles are great and the vegetables are fresh. Yum."
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"Great subs and open till 3am, better than any other sub fast sub shop, get the chill on cold days yummm and than potato  salad in the summer :-)"
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"First time visit to this sub shop.  It's about a half mile from my new office, so I had to try it out my first week.  I ordered a customized Georgetown sub.  It was a sad little sub. There was literally one thin slice of turkey deli meat on the sandwich, with a tiny sliver of cheese, tasteless bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado paste.  Definitely not a quality sandwich or satisfying meal.  This place gets credit for easy online ordering and delivery until 3am.  But honestly, if I'm hungry in middle of the night, I'm quite certain I would not order from this place!"
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,Their Cripple Creek sub was very good.  Very soft wheat bread and the rest of the sub just melted in my mouth.  I'd go there again!
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,Very bad costumer service. Placed an order at 10p and was delivered 40 minutes later incorrectly. I called to try to get a correct sub re delivered. The manager told me it would be over an hour delivery time and they refused to credit my card back even for the one incorrect sub. I would never spend another dime here.
Silver Mine Subs,kid's turkey and cheese sub,"I've had two subs from here. The Italian sub, and I can't recall the other. Nothing special in my book. Overpriced. Bread is OK. Just another sub shop with a catchy name and a weird menu. Quick service. It is clean and easy to get to. Doubt that I'll be back."

Silver Mine Subs,grilled chicken salad,"I was looking forward to a salad for lunch. The best thing about this salad was the bag of chips that came with it!  The iceburg lettuce had more rust on it than an unconditioned 1963 Chevy, the chicken is some kind of extruded processed meat concoction and all that was accompanied by three cherry tomatoes. This was unconditionally the absolute worst salad I have ever had! NEVER AGAIN!"

Silver Mine Subs,grilled chicken salad,Checked this place out because we had some coupons. My boyfriend and I ordered a cripple creek and a buffalo chicken sandwich both on wheat. Both were supposed to be hot. We got home and neither were hot (we live less than 2 miles away.. I expected at very least mildly warm) and both were on white bread. My sandwich also came without bacon like noted. The sandwich was decent but with so many things wrong with our order I doubt we'll go back.
