El Pastor,side salad,"I love tacos. Plain and simple. And that is how I like my tacos too; plain and simple; your taco meat (or vegetables for you non-animal eating people) with onions and cilantro. El Pastor gives it to you just like that. The tacos I ate yesterday were a 4-5. That is the truth. I was hungry and I wanted tacos. They themselves were brilliant. However, if I am going to rate the entire overall experience I am giving my experience from yesterday a 3/5. Maybe it was because I was crabby from being up until 4 am, but I felt like I was waiting for an eternity for my food to arrive. When I arrived to El Pastor we were seated but it took a while for our waitress to come greet us, and I actually believe it was the host that eventually came back to take our drink order and not even our waitress. For 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were people in there but not enough people in there for me to have to wait as long as I did. 

I do believe my linner? Lunner? (lunch and dinner?) was the same as the man-friends. I think we both had the pork, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Bless those tacos. I would bill the chicken tacos as my least favorite of the three yesterday with the chorizo being the stand-out star. It was spiced beautifully and served at a perfect temperature. It was slightly more charred than what I would have liked, but hey, it was still pretty darn good. 

Will I be back?

Duh.

But will it be anytime soon? Probably not, as I am hearing of this new taco hot-spot on the east side that I believe needs to be checked out soon."
El Pastor,side salad,"This was our first attempt at finding a good mexican restaurant in Madison.  The chips and salsa weren't great.  The salsa didnt seem very fresh but had a good kick.  I had the enchilada plate (one chees, two chicken with red and mole sauce.  My wife had the torta.  We also had a taco pastor, chile relleno and cheese quesadilla.
The enchiladas were horrible.  really nothing else to add about that.  the rice and beans were pretty good though.  Torta was excellent.  the taco was a little on the dry side and the relleno had very little spice.  cheese quesadilla was good, but it is pretty tough to screw that up.  The nite we were there they had $1.25 draft beer.  that was nice!!
In the end, I will definitely be trying other Mexican restaurants before going back."
El Pastor,side salad,"A second visit at 8:30 on a Monday night yielded good service, generous portions, and a great plate of chicken enchiladas rojas topped with a tasty cheese. The beans and rice were just as good as on my first visit and the little salad of iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and sliced onion was fresh, crisp, and cold.

I'll definitely be back."
El Pastor,side salad,"Yes , it is better than other Mexican restaurants in Madison. But please don't expect the most authentic stuff. It's good food, but there isn't so much I can rave about.  OK margarita, ok tacos  - the meats on the tacos were little on the dry side, and I wished they had more homemade salsa rather than the bottled hot sauce.  Good volume on plates."
El Pastor,side salad,"El Pastor has consistently good food. Comfort food for me. I've had their tacos, quesadilla, salad, beans, rice, enchiladas, torta and many other items on their menu. Chicken or beef is my favorite. Mix and match for a custom plate. They have 5-10 lunch time specials too. Try the horchata. It is delicious. I keep saying that I want to try their flan, but usually I'm stuffed after the chips and salsa (3 kinds available) and then the meal. I should stop in one day for the flan and a horchata."
El Pastor,side salad,"This place is pretty straight forward. It's very much where the local Madison resident population hangs out/gets their food. I could see the food being less consistently good at times just because the place seems very informal. 

The price is right though and it hasn't bit me yet. Portions aren't too shabby and they have everything you might need.  Take a ride on the wild side, head done Park St. and give this simple but more authentic joint a chance."
El Pastor,side salad,"I live close to La Mestiza on Madison's west side, but I'd rather go to El Pastor. It's quieter, the staff is friendlier, and the food is great.

I've had several things off the menu (all good) but my favorite, by far, is the whole fried tilapia. It is exactly as billed - a whole fish, lightly floured and fried to perfection. It's fiddly food, to be sure - you're picking around a carcass. But it is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort. The fish comes with your choice of rice and beans, or salad and fries. Both options come with tortillas on the side, so you can make your own fish tacos, if you like. 

The margaritas are great - and are 2-for-1 on Wednesday evenings. They also have a variety of Mexican soft drinks (including Mexican Coca-Cola, made with sugar). And beer, of course.

My dining companion and I have been here so often, in fact, that we have a code for when one of us wants to go to El Pastor. We just say, ""Let's go eat a fish."" We always leave sated and happy."
Sa-Bai Thong West,74. veggie fried rice,"The pad Thai  is too soggy and wet, if a Thai restaurant can't make a reasonable Pad Thai, then they don't have good Thai food.
I went there twice, never want to go 3rd time,   the other rice noodles are tasteless also.
The services are slow.
But they have ok appetizers."
Sa-Bai Thong West,74. veggie fried rice,"We used to come here a lot. So much so the staff recognized us upon entry. There food and service were always good. However recently the prices, portion sizes, and flavor have not been up to par. It is a nicer Thai restaurant in the area with a cozy, inviting dining area. But the prices for what you get just aren't worth it anymore.

I used to get their Pad Thai which I used to enjoy but I've found a better place that is more tasty. I like my pad thai a little dryer. The pad thai here is more saucy and the noodles more slippery. We also enjoy many of their appetizers: crab rangoon, shrimp purse, Ming sabai, egg rolls, etc. There is also a noodle dish my husband and I both enjoy. It has wider rice noodles with a darker sauce and Thai basil. We ordered here a couple months ago to try it again and our usual Thai place is much better, significantly cheaper, and larger portions.

If you looking for a nicer dine-in place then its a good place to go. But we prefer other Thai restaurants in the area."
Sa-Bai Thong West,74. veggie fried rice,"Great first time here for dinner last night. 

Atmosphere was relaxing and quiet. It was only about 4 or 5 tables since it was an hour from closing when we arrived. Service was average.

We started with the Toong Thong for appetizer (Ground chicken, potato, carrot and onion wrapped with rice paper skin slightly deep fried to golden brown, served with house sauce). Bf's first time having Thai food and he enjoyed this. 

I had the Tom Yum soup, which is a little off from what I'm used to but it was overloaded with mushrooms and had a little spice to it. Officially one of my new favorite soups!

He had the curry fried rice with chicken. Didn't expect it to be as spicy as it was, but it was still VERY good. I had a few bites and even though it was a little too much onions, we'd definitely order it again.

It was a late dinner so I didn't get a chance to order a couple more things to introduce him to, but we'll definitely be back!"
Hooters,grilled chicken sandwich and wise choice salad,"We have eaten here many times. We have never had bad service or food. We have ordered wings, fries, onion straws, chicken sliders, fried pickles, and ice cold beer. The last time we went I was a little disappointed in the cleanliness of the restaurant. They were not busy. The booths were dirty seats and tables. We switched twice looking for a clean area to eat in. This was the first time we have noticed the place being dirty. We will go back."
Hooters,grilled chicken sandwich and wise choice salad,"I give the extra star for the pretty waitresses...yeah, they did something right.

Anyway, do you like eating frozen bagged food dumped into a deep fryer while your waitress, in her tight shirt and short pants, flirts money out of you?  The soda was a bit watered down, the chicken was disgusting.  It's embarrassing how much the waitresses try to embezzle tips out if you.  Let's face it, this is what the guys go there for.  They certainly can't tell you that they go for the food...again, it was disgusting.  

My suggestion, if you want to meet women, join a dating site, if you want good food, go somewhere else.  In either case, don't go here."
Hooters,grilled chicken sandwich and wise choice salad,"I absolutely love this Hooters,  Every time I come in with my husband and teenaged son, the waitresses are always so pleasant and helpful.  I love their parmesan chicken wings so I keep going back for more.

Anyone saying that this place is demeaning to women, I say this. No one is forcing you to go here.   Nobody is forcing these girls to work here.  I am sure that these girls make nice tips as they are so friendly to the customers.  I wish a lot of other restaurants in Madison had waitresses half as friendly as the Hooters' girls.

Excellent location just off I-90.  Food has always been good.  It's not gourmet but good for bar food."

Nam's Noodle,k35. korean bbq short ribs,"I ordered the Korean short ribs and the mango bubble tea. The Korean short ribs were a little disappointing, not grilled enough And a bit too chewy. The mango bubble tea was delicious. Generous portion and quick delivery."
Nam's Noodle,k35. korean bbq short ribs,"I have to be honest in that the two stars I'm giving isn't really all that fair to Nam's Noodle.

I can only eat one dish at this place as I've got a food allergy to onions; knowing full well that onions are critical to taste for a lot of dishes, I try and stick to this one dish. Also because I generally feel guilty if I have to ask to have it removed. With that said, the one dish I can eat here is OK; the barbecued honey pork ribs are pretty solid and have a pretty decent taste, but it's nothing extraordinary.

The service isn't phenomenal either; they do what they're supposed to, but they don't really go above and beyond. Also, you have to spend $20 to be able to run a credit card here, so for someone that rarely has cash, $20 is a bit too much to spend on mediocre food.

But Nam's saving grace is its traditional-style karaoke rooms. Although a lot of the songs are mostly Asian (and by this, predominantly Korean, Japanese and Chinese), there are American/English songs there as well. And while they're only MIDI-versions of the songs, it still provides a lot of fun if you've got a lot of friends with you.

I've got some pretty good memories associated with this place, but it's not somewhere I go to a lot anyways."
The Taco Shop,side of cheese,"My experience with the Taco Shop was as extreme letdown. My friend and I hit up Taco Shop after one night and were thoroughly disappointed with our experience. I could have made the tacos at home. The tortilla was cold, the cheese tasted like Sargento - not melty and delicious like the asadero cheese from Burrito Drive or the Sabores Latinos food cart. Not even decent enough for a late night snack. Horrible horrible horrible."
The Taco Shop,side of cheese,"THE BRANCH BROUGHT IN FROM AMSTERDAM BREAKS
When I looked at the menu I immediately and naturally made up my mind and ordered 3 soft shell tacos, and a side of guacamole that totaled a little under $10.  I thought I would try each of the different meats they offer.  Shredded beef, ground beef, and shredded chicken.  This was disappointing because I like the option of grilled meats.  

The tacos were nothing special.  Although they are stuffed with the standard which includes: meat, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and pica de gallo, the flavor was nothing special.  When I think of tasty mexican fare that has been memorable I think of big bold flavors.  The two salsas that were served were both red.  Mild was not very flavorful, the hot was and added a nice little kick to the tacos.  The gauc. was good.  Although, it was very smooth.  The guac had no chunks of avocado, the texture made it seem as though it had all been run through a blender.  I also think that it was more of a crema which did not please me.  What was nice is that they included a small handful of chips which were very good.  Thin, fresh, and salted to perfection.  
Out of the tacos meats I liked the shredded beef the best.  Would I go back?  Sure, but I would not get the tacos again.  Hopefully the chimi will have better luck."
The Taco Shop,side of cheese,"I've never been all that into skiing. I always considered myself more of a snowboarder. Skiing just always seemed so easy. Anyone can make a pizza slice with their skis and head down a hill. Piece of cake. You see children doing it all the time.

That's the thing about skiing though...it's only really easy at the beginning. Most people can do it, but it takes so much time and energy to get truly great at skiing. There is a night-and-day difference between the people on the bunny hills and the people hitting the double black diamonds.

In this way, making tacos is pretty much exactly like skiing. Anyone (even a child) can make something and call it a taco...but to make a truly great taco...that takes something special. The Taco Shop does not have that something. The Taco Shop hasn't begun to even consider the possibility of taking the ski lift up the mountain. The Taco Shop is stuck on the bunny hills.

I arrived shortly after 9pm with a small group of friends. There was a decent sized group of people there when we arrived, but they had all finished eating. By the looks of things, the kitchen was waiting for our orders to come in. I ordered three tacos at the counter: carne asada (steak), carnitas (pork), and a roasted veggie. When you order three tacos you also receive beans (black or pinto) and rice on the side. 

We waited somewhere between 5-10 minutes for our food to be brought to the table. While we waited we had some time to take in the decor. The place looks nice enough. They were clearly on a budget, but it all came together okay. It appears they're going for a bit of a west coast nautical theme. They have a surfboard mounted on one of the walls and the color scheme is indicative of a Southern California beach shack...but, confusingly, they don't offer any seafood tacos. No shrimp. No fish. Nothing. Weird. Oh well.

Before the food arrived a friend asked if they make their own corn tortillas in house. We were informed they do not...and you could tell. The individual tortillas were extremely thick to begin with, and, inexplicably, they doubled them up.

All three tacos I ordered looking fairly traditional. The carne asada was served with onion, cilantro, and avocado, the carnitas had just cilantro, and the veggie was topped with a bit of cheese. My guess is that this minimalist preparation is designed to really highlight the meat...which is unfortunate because the meat wasn't noteworthy in any way. The carne asada was pretty well cooked but had virtually no seasoning, and the carnitas were the exact opposite.

All of the issues I had with the tacos could have forgiven if there had been some selection of homemade salsas to accompany my tacos, but, alas, there was no salsa bar in sight.

Onto the sides...the beans were fine. Nothing special, but not bad. The rice on the other hand was terrible. It had the consistency of Uncle Ben's minute rice. I would not be surprised if it had been microwaved.

I've really struggled to figure out why it would take more than 2 minutes to dish out tacos when the kitchen isn't making its own tortillas or salsas. You're basically just scooping meat into a shell.

If you're looking for good late night food hit up any one of the food carts dotted throughout Madison. If you're looking to support a local business in the vicinity walk straight out of the Taco Shop and head to Ians Pizza. If you're looking for a mediocre taco you can find Qdoba and Chipotle right on State St.

To make it in Madison you can't be on the bunny hills...you have to master the double black diamonds."
The Taco Shop,side of cheese,"I went there the other day, because I wanted mexican food and it was close by to my apartment. Let's just say I will never go back. It was the most horrible experience I had in any restaurant I have ever been to. When I walked in, I took a look at the menu and I saw a guy in the back room that was just staring and didn't even say hi or greet us or anything. Then after 5 mins he came out and just stared at us again and didn't even say anything. When I started ordering he rolled his eyes at everything I said. Then he said my total was 14 dollars. Then I asked him if I could get a side of extra habenero salsa, and he said the nachos already came with salsa and refused to add an extra side of it to the order under any circumstances. Is this a joke? He snapped at me. Then he charged my card and gave me a receipt that said 20 dollars on it when he said my total was 14. I questioned him as to why this was. In the rudest and most hostile manner he proceeded to do some weird made up math that made no sense. I waited to get the receipt and immediately saw mistakes, and he did in fact over charge me and added things I didn't even order. I slapped the receipt down and demanded for a refund. At this point he felt stupid and calmed down his hostility. I got my refund and immediately left. I recommend not to go to this place unless you want terrible hostile service from psycho people. He honestly looked and behaved in a deranged manner. Once again, this was my worse experience in my whole entire life in a restaurant."
The Taco Shop,side of fresco cheese,"My experience with the Taco Shop was as extreme letdown. My friend and I hit up Taco Shop after one night and were thoroughly disappointed with our experience. I could have made the tacos at home. The tortilla was cold, the cheese tasted like Sargento - not melty and delicious like the asadero cheese from Burrito Drive or the Sabores Latinos food cart. Not even decent enough for a late night snack. Horrible horrible horrible."
The Taco Shop,side of fresco cheese,"THE BRANCH BROUGHT IN FROM AMSTERDAM BREAKS
When I looked at the menu I immediately and naturally made up my mind and ordered 3 soft shell tacos, and a side of guacamole that totaled a little under $10.  I thought I would try each of the different meats they offer.  Shredded beef, ground beef, and shredded chicken.  This was disappointing because I like the option of grilled meats.  

The tacos were nothing special.  Although they are stuffed with the standard which includes: meat, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and pica de gallo, the flavor was nothing special.  When I think of tasty mexican fare that has been memorable I think of big bold flavors.  The two salsas that were served were both red.  Mild was not very flavorful, the hot was and added a nice little kick to the tacos.  The gauc. was good.  Although, it was very smooth.  The guac had no chunks of avocado, the texture made it seem as though it had all been run through a blender.  I also think that it was more of a crema which did not please me.  What was nice is that they included a small handful of chips which were very good.  Thin, fresh, and salted to perfection.  
Out of the tacos meats I liked the shredded beef the best.  Would I go back?  Sure, but I would not get the tacos again.  Hopefully the chimi will have better luck."
The Taco Shop,side of fresco cheese,"I've never been all that into skiing. I always considered myself more of a snowboarder. Skiing just always seemed so easy. Anyone can make a pizza slice with their skis and head down a hill. Piece of cake. You see children doing it all the time.

That's the thing about skiing though...it's only really easy at the beginning. Most people can do it, but it takes so much time and energy to get truly great at skiing. There is a night-and-day difference between the people on the bunny hills and the people hitting the double black diamonds.

In this way, making tacos is pretty much exactly like skiing. Anyone (even a child) can make something and call it a taco...but to make a truly great taco...that takes something special. The Taco Shop does not have that something. The Taco Shop hasn't begun to even consider the possibility of taking the ski lift up the mountain. The Taco Shop is stuck on the bunny hills.

I arrived shortly after 9pm with a small group of friends. There was a decent sized group of people there when we arrived, but they had all finished eating. By the looks of things, the kitchen was waiting for our orders to come in. I ordered three tacos at the counter: carne asada (steak), carnitas (pork), and a roasted veggie. When you order three tacos you also receive beans (black or pinto) and rice on the side. 

We waited somewhere between 5-10 minutes for our food to be brought to the table. While we waited we had some time to take in the decor. The place looks nice enough.

Chili's,sweet corn on the cob,"Chili's....it is what it is, and my review reflects this....

We typically come here at least 3 or 4 times a year, at least one time being for a birthday party and ribs.  They have ALWAYS treated us well, the food is decent, service is friendly, the the Chili's experience is perfect for a fun, bit loud, and silly birthday party.  The staff are fun, and oh-so-patient.  Hint...free brownie-ice cream treat on birthdays and with movie ticket stubs.  DANGER...sweet but, hard to resist.

The other times we're here it's for lunch during errands.  We usually sit at a hi-top in the bar to avoid the wait.  The waits can be long during peak periods but, they handle them well.  It's a fun place to watch games, good visibility of televisions in the bar and they're really nice about switching channels.  I've always had decent service here, too.

The food...the food is Chili's.  It's not fine dining, and not meant to be.  It's a hell of a lot better than Perkins or Red Robin.  They do a nice Tex-Mex/American blend menu, with a lot of good healthy choice options.  They're also not afraid to do tangy, hot, and flavorful.  If you can't find something you like on the huge menu, you're just too darn picky and don't go out to eat with me.

My only complaint is the place can be dirty.  To be fair, that's a bit inevitable with such a popular and busy location.  The staff do run around cleaning and are attentive but, on more than one occasion, I've had a dirty booth or table.  So, for that, 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give them 4.5 if it was an option."
Chili's,sweet corn on the cob,"Well that was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. We asked to have our son's food first so we could feed our 1 yr old and everything came out at once in under 5 minutes. The food was sub par at best, the ""crispy chicken"" was more soggy then my pasta and half of her dish was ice cold and the corn on the cob was raw.  And my dish was better served out of a buffet. It might not have been so dry and tasteless if the food was not cooked this morning . My wife's drink originally came with something floating in it. Even though it was a Saturday evening it was still early, we saw the bus boy at our table more often than our waiter. It has been some time since our last visit to a Chili's and the only reason we went there tonight was because we had a gift card. I think it will be some time before we'll feel brave enough to try them again."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,japanese soda,"I'm rating this 5 stars in regards to Madison standards.  I've been very disappointed in Madison's other Hibachi restaurants, none have come close to my favorites from back in Florida and elsewhere, but Takara surprised me by how well the food was prepared as well as how fresh it was and the service was excellent and very attentive and our hibachi chef was very talented and funny as well.  The ginger dressing on the salad was very tasty but I wasn't in the mood for soup so I didn't try it myself but my girlfriend seemed to like it.  Plus they carry Ramune soda!  If you've never had Ramune it's worth coming here just for that."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,japanese soda,"Nothing like a record breaking protest for democracy in Wisconsin to test the relative abilities of the restaurants near the capitol to handle big crowds.  Takara did much better than most, they managed to squeeze us in within a couple of minutes, and overall, the service was polite, quick, attentive, and competent, by American standards.  By Japanese standards, they were a little rude, no welcome (""irasshaimase""), or oshibori (hot towel to wash up with), or hot tea (ocha). On the way out, polite Japanese waitstaff always thank you (maido arigato!"", or at least just, maido""!, if it's busy)"".  Not here. 
      A note for those of you who are trying to make sense of the rather wide range of ratings from the Yelpers here, the prices are a bargain for sushi if you're from out of town, but by Madison grad student standards, this is an expensive dinner; compared to sushi prices for Madison area Japanese and pseudo-Japanese restaurants, this place is about average.  Yes, the staff is Asian, but no, they are most certainly NOT Japanese.  There are various hints, like, for instance, they don't speak Japanese, and the menu has odd mistakes. For example, instead of tonkatsu, they have ""katsu dipping sauce,"" and they provide spoons with the soups (Japanese soup should be eaten by bringing the bowl up to your face with the fingers of both hands), the food isn't always served in the appropriate (according to Japanese manners) bowls or dishes. So, if you're looking for authentic Japanese, you might be a little disappointed, there's this silly ""Hibachi"" open grill set up for entertainment-cum-Japanese-stereotype dinner, that should be avoided.  
     The sushi on the other hand, is pretty good.  They have a good but not great selection of the standard sushi choices, they also have some original and inventive rolls, I liked my ""samurai roll,"" though it was cut in an odd way.  Japanese sushi should be eaten in one bite, so that the beautifully presented piece isn't aesthetically marred on the way in, but the roll I ordered was cut into pieces too large to get into even my big mouth in one bite.  The unagi, tomago, and toro were quite good, the uni was slightly off (I wonder if it was microwave defrosted).  The edamame was fresh and generous in portion size.  You don't automatically get a bowl of miso first, you have to order it separately, although minor, I didn't like that, on a cold day, it's just good Japanese manners to warm your customers up with really hot miso, and if you're ordering a lot of sushi, the cost of ""complimentary"" miso is really negligible.  
     The tempura and katsu were tasty, but not quite right (the batter and frying oil weren't exactly right).  Tempura is a challenge, the texture has to be just so, it needs to taste light and crispy, very hot, not greasy in spite of the fact that it's fried.  If you've had a lot of Japanese food, you'll know what I mean, the tempura and katsu will be a tad disappointing, if you're not so familiar with authentic Japanese, it's not like the Takara versions are not palatable, they're just not exactly correct.  When tempura is done right, the batter is made with icy water, prepared from scratch just before frying in sesame oil.  If shortcuts are taken, a mixture of cheaper oils, batter made up before hand, lukewarm water is used, then the characteristic texture and taste is slightly off even if the rest of the recipe and cooking process is loyal to tradition.  They're taking some sort of similar shortcut with the katsu, as the breading isn't quite Japanese panko, and they don't serve it cut lengthwise the way the Japanese like it, they've invented a kind of nugget variation. 
      The location is very convenient for either the capitol or the UW-Madison campus."
Takara Japanese Restaurant,japanese soda,"Sushi here was really good, go for the crunchy shrimp. The Katsu Don was average, not anything special. Restaurant is owned chinese people, not authentic Japanese."

There will probably be some confusion at first as The Isthmus recently mentioned this restaurant, calling it Juquila.  However after chatting with Francisco himself last night, it's going to be called Francisco's Cantina for time being, as that's the name on the liquor license.  Asi es la vida.  

What's not confusing is the food and liquor.  It's a god send.  It's got the freaking trifecta:  (1) delicious (2) cheap (3) likely open after bar time (or your shift if you work in the industry).  Item (3) will become a reality soon when the man gets some more help in the kitchen.

I shared drinks and dinner with a good friend around 10pm last night.  We had the requisite chips and salsa.  A massive (had to weigh 5lbs) steak burrito with house-made mole negro and a plate with assorted, chicken filled, verde/rojo tamales.  We washed down said food with half a dozen shots of Camarena Blanco and cuatro Bohemias.

Total bill:  $41.  Seriously!  Why go anywhere else?  

Now it's time we all thank Francisco and our respective deities for gifting us an amazing restaurant that doesn't close at 9pm.  Go support this guy and his food else I'm gonna be mad at you Madison."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,mole poblano,"Some of the best Mexican food in the city, and they serve proper mole. Their tortilla soup is wonderful, their tacos are phenomenal, their enchiladas top notch. Great, authentic Mexican."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,mole poblano,"This is THE place to go if you're on the East side of the square at bar time and you're hungry. The food is very good, it's cheap, and they're open very late.

Don't go here if you've only got 20 minutes--you'll be waiting a while for the food.  But the staff are great, and as I said, the food's even better.  So far, I haven't found a better spot for mole in Madison.  Also?  The portions are pretty huge.

Sometimes it can get pretty loud (well duh--it's a restaurant that caters to the late-night crowd).  Someday I'll have to try it during regular hours..."
Francisco's Mexican Cantina,mole poblano,"Our favorite stop downtown. You always hear that Madison has no good Mexican food. Almost true- except for this little gem. This place is 1) cheap 2) delicious 3) served by the nicest people 

Their beans are not thick and old. Their nachos own. Check out lunch specials for great deals. The sopes are the a delight, as are tamales. Nachos NOM. Fajitas mixed great deal. Roommates family is loyal to their mole over all others. 

Sometime open late for post- bars. Highly recommended by true Mexican lovers."
People's Bakery,yogurt salad,"Ok, let's just be honest here. The ""decor"" leaves much to be desired. But really, this is not why I stop at People's Bakery. It's those damn doughnuts (the French crullers to be specific). These guys make the most amazing doughnuts, the French cruller as you've now learned are my favorite. I can easily inhale 3 or 4 of these buggers at a time. They are perfectly light and airy, and the glaze hugs the outside so perfectly, they just melt in your mouth. God I love 'em. I've also had the kibbe, which I think is wonderful. My son will accompany me on a trip to People's Bakery if I promise to buy him a couple doughnuts. The two of us sit in the scanty boothed table as he unenthusiastically watches me savor every last tidbit of the kibbe dipped in the yogurt sauce. Mmmmm... considering how labor intensive it is to make kibbe at home, these are a god-send. I'm admittedly no connoisseur when it comes to Lebanese foods, but their kibbe wins my vote for quick and tasty. On a side note: my son who is a teenager, still remembers when he was 2 yrs old, how the owner was so nice to him and greeted him every time we entered the store. It may not be a palace, but the food and pride in ownership makes a mark on one's memory and taste buds."
People's Bakery,yogurt salad,"Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet, with the name People's Bakery, you'd never guess this place would have the best Middle Eastern food in Madison.  

Start with the wife of the wife and husband team, who greets you warmly as you come in.  The menu is on the wall, but there are hard copies for those who need an explanation of the nicely blended mix of Lebanese, Armenian and Syrian dishes.  No matter your experience with food of the Middle East or Mediterranean, you'll find dishes you recognize, perhaps by different names.

This was my first visit, I'm sitting here eating my takeout order as I type this because it's that good.  I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    

Quick review:
- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint

- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.  And holy COW was she right.  A smack of roasted red pepper is quickly deepened by a sweet hit of pomegranate and walnuts, ubelievably complex and wonderful.

- Falafel.  Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.

- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  

Sarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful

All in all, outstanding.  Next time, shish tahouk and baba ganouj."
People's Bakery,yogurt salad,"The food and service attitude is pretty good for the price you pay.
They also got all kinds of beverages to go with your meal. They cook it fresh after you place an order. The owners are very nice.

We had the vegetarian meza. Everything tastes good, though I've definitely had better middle eastern food before. But for the price you pay, the food is well worth it. All the basics are done right, e.g. dolma, hummus, kabob/shawarma, cucumber yogurt, kofta, kebbi, etc.

But I will mention stuff they could improve a bit more:
The red pepper paste was a bit bitter, but taste fresh
Tabouli was a bit saucy (ask them to use less dressing)."
Dhaba Indian Bistro,gobhi paratha,"I asked for a table next to the windows this time, and the ambience was just fine. The waiters are also very attentive while unobtrusive, all in all providing a nice quiet experience.

I had the fish pakora again alongside tandoori paratha. The fish pakora was still quite good, although milder than I remembered. The paratha was disappointing. I admit that I'm not sure what paratha should be, but it seemed tasteless to me.

A nice place overall."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"We LOVED this place! We had the tandoori chicken, tandoori mixed grill and naan. Everything was so flavorful we wanted to keep eating even though the portions are so big you shouldn't clean your plate. We went at dinner on a Wednesday night, so it was pretty empty, but the service was excellent. Maharani just became one of our favorites in Madison!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"We stopped by at this restaurant on way from Wisconsin dells to chicago.
Food was disgusting, pricey and very small quantity. We ordered chicken biryani which had only two small pieces of chicken and had no taste. Service was also dicriminatory for white and non white people. White oeople will get great service and also a hot towel to wash hands athe end of dinner. Non white will not get that service.
to sum up bad food and pricey. You could get better food  for that price. We strongly donot recomnend this place to anyone.

Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"The roach wasn't THAT big. Maybe thumbnail sized. I mean, I've seen ones in other countries the size of my entire thumb, so this was a lil' guy in comparison.

Mind you, that happened at the end of the meal so perhaps I should start at the beginning. 

We've been to Maharani countless times over the years. The food is usually good, the service is usually pretty lackluster.  However, this place has held a warm spot in my heart because it was one of our first date spots so we like to come back & reminisce.  

On this particular evening the service was worse than usual. We had to remind them we had ordered drinks, they brought out a completely wrong entree for the Mister, and the naan bread finally came out halfway through the meal. SIGH.  I think part of the service problem here is that they seem to do a team approach instead of sticking with assigned sections. So things just seem to fall by the wayside and who knows. Was this all foreshadowing what was to come?!  Perhaps. 

We finished eating & the server cleared away our plates. As she walked away I looked down to see a cockroach scurry across the table. It seemed to have been hiding under my plate.  The Mister, aghast, promptly trapped the rascal under a napkin and waited for the server to come back. She returned (to bring us our to-go boxes) and he lifted the napkin to show her the offending critter. She gasped and scooped it all up and went into the back. 

The Mister & I just stared at each other, incredulous. We figured this would be interesting... how would they handle it?  Would our dinner be comped? Would a manager come out, very apologetic?  

Soon after, she returned and informed us that pest control had been here earlier that day (presumably this was the excuse/explanation for why the roaches were on the run). She promptly handed us our bill and advised us she'd given us 20% off, explaining she'd only done that much since we'd already eaten our dinner.

SCREEEEEEEECCCCCHHH!   Wait.A.Minute.Here  So, what I'm understanding is that depending on at what point during your meal you have the bad experience, your discount will reflect that.  Good thing we didn't order dessert... if the roach had waited to show it's face until then it might have only been 5% off! 

I get it, restaurants can have roaches and many of them around town probably do. (Ick. I can't think about it too much or I'll end up a hermit). Regardless, it's pretty unusual for them to turn up on your table and what's critical after an incident like this is staff response which, disappointingly, was sorely lacking here."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"The food deserves 5 stars, but the service really brings it down.
                                                                                                                                                                      
We were there several times for lunch buffet and never try their dinner. The service has always been pretty inattentive and sometimes unwelcoming, so never will try dinner.

Their naan bread is super great, always made fresh, so sometimes you gotta wait a little bit; most dishes are above level good--their chicken dishes are tender most of the time. The use of spices is excellent and exotic. I never tried fried food and they do look a bit soggy but again I can't tell. Dessert is always the same but I'm not bothered by that.

This is not a huge buffet, but the food they offer is great.  I like it this way because one really doesn't eat that much.  
 
The thing we don't like is the service, as mentioned. Sometimes servers don't even smile and come and go without saying anything.  Plates on your desk remain there.       

I don't think their servers do that on purpose, it's probably just the Indian way? However that does make the dinning experience sometimes uncomfortable.      Another thing is, when the food is empty, refills are slow or missing. It happens on weekends as well, days you pay more.

We still come back because the food is still pretty good. It's just such a shame that                                                                                                                                                                                                              they would have been such a great restaurant!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! I eat here about once a month. The chicken tikka masala is my go to dish. I also love their lamb shahi korma. All of their naan is delicious, they have lots of choices. I usually go for the cheese stuffed naan. If you order delivery expect about an hour wait. Dinner service is always consistent & very timely. I've never had to wait long to be seated. Be sure to finish your meal with a mango lassi. If you're craving Indian food, this is your place!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"So far my favorite Madison Indian restaurant.  Everything's always been fresh and tasty, and there are SO many choices!  The staff is friendly but a tad slow, but nothing to be annoyed with at all.  My first recommendation if someone asks for a good Indian buffet or sit down dinner!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"Maharini is a large menu Indian food restaurant with all the classic vegetarian options. This restaurant is the kind of place that has some vegetarian options under the curries, but then also a vegetarian section, but then also a vegetables section: it's that kind of confusing restaurant. But, my friends and I found the small text that said vegetable dinner for two, and the rest is history.

The dinner came with samosas, palak paneer, mixed vegetable curry, malai kofta, rice, naan, and dessert. It started out with a lentil soup, which was not very good. Imagine buying chicken noodle soup, and instead of getting a broth with chicken and noodles in it, you get kind of a frothy, thicker soup that was the aforementioned soup put through a Ninja blender. That's what the soup was like: no lentils to be seen, a bit thicker, some lentil taste, and not very flavorful. 

The samosas were great. The crispy outside was nicely matched with the soft, potato inside. Out of the main dishes, I'd say only the malai kofta is worth recommending. The malai kofta was very good: the sauce was flavorful, not overwhelming, and it wonderfully seasoned each ball. The palak paneer should be avoided: its texture was quite unpleasant. Google is telling me that the difference between palak paneer and saag paneer is that palak is only spinach. The mixed vegetable curry was fine, but nothing worth writing home about (though, everything is worth telling Yelp about, I guess). I think it's worth noting that the rice was delicious, and I ate too much of it.

The service was okay. The food took a very long time to come out: I believe we waited around 35 minutes, and the restaurant was more than half empty at dinner time on Saturday night.

If I'm ever back in Madison and craving Indian food, I'd return if I couldn't find an alternative!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"Recent dinner experience at the Maharani was somewhat disappointing, It was crowded, but no excuse for the barely courteous service, dishes ordered not being delivered, etc. My mixed vegetable curry was hot, but lacked the subtle mix of spices that goes into good Indian cuisine. The vegetables were overcooked,lacked flavor. My dining companion was similarly underwhelmed by his lamb dish. Perhaps best to stick with the lunch buffet here. If they continue to offer dinner, they should ramp up the quality of the cooking and the service."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"Delicious food! We came here for dinner in a Saturday. Panneer was tasty and had a great texture, naan was perfectly cooked. Lamb was tender. Looking forward to the lunch buffet."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"They get points for having an insane line-up of naan, perhaps 10 if my memory serves me, and my vegetable curry was really rocking, but the place loses major points for it's staff. Inattentive, unkind, and almost abrasive at times. I'm not sure if it was an off night, because few other reviews mention this point, but it really soured my evening. I'll likely head back to try their lunch buffet, where services simply isn't as important, but I find that there's a wealth of Indian restaurants in town, and if I'm doing dinner at one of them, it likely won't be Maharani."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"Maharani is always at the top of our to-eat list: the food, the service, the location, the FOOD! all make this a really top-notch Indian restaurant.  I know that the dinner menu is great, but we hardly ever make it here for dinner, just because the lunch buffet is so impressive and reasonably-priced (there's a student discount, too). The naan is baked fresh and brought right to your table, the chutneys and sauces complement the food nicely, the samosas are perfectly dense and crispy, and the spices in the main dishes are just right (even though I could probably take it a little spicier).  And the waiters are always so attentive--Preet is especially wonderful! I love Maharani!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"Once you get over the fact that you seem to be the only person talking in the restaurant because it's such an expansive place, you get lost in the large, delicious portions and steamy, buttery naan. The place doesn't look fancy enough for the prices on the dinner menu (about $13-16), but the food is good enough to avoid regret. 

If you don't want anything specific, the buffet is well worth it- all of the dishes always look steaming hot and fresh and there are at least 20+ different items (plus dessert) to choose from...all for only $8.95.

in fact, i wish i was there right now."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"I love this place. Lunch buffet is pretty good, but sometimes I can't get what I want, so I often go for dinner too. My favorites are veg samosa - which I eat with onion chutney, and Paneer Tikka Masala - Hot, spicy one. LOVE IT LOVE IT! If you are a student, they give you 10% off- so please do use them. it's my top favorite restaurant in town."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"The best Indian food in Madison! Really fast and friendly service whether you eat in for dinner or lunch buffet or get take out. In a perfect world, I would have their fluffy buttery naan with every meal every day of my life."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"Indian food is generally expensive and this place is no exception. We ordered the veg dinner for 2 and it was way too much food which we were happy to pack and take home. The curries are nice and flavorful. We had samosas, mulligatawny soup, malai kofta, mix veg and daal (you can switch the curries with your choice of entre) we finished with gulag jamun which were not so great."
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,One star just because the food is good. Be prepared to wait 2 hours to see a waiter. The manager is also incompetent and a horrible at customer service. We had to ask waiters to bring things like water before finally debating on leaving without paying after no one gave us our check. Ended up paying the manager directly and storming off after a terrible dinner. At least the food was good...
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"I've eaten at Maharani both for their lunch buffet and for dinner.

When it comes to their lunch buffet where Maharani truly excels is selection. They have the widest selection available in the Madison area which allows you to try more things -- half the point of a lunch buffet, in my opinion.

The lunch buffet has had consistently good quality food for the several times I've been there. They also do have some spicy dishes for those who are concerned about the lack of authenticity in the heat at most Indian buffets and fortunately by having more dishes available they keep service accessible to most people.

Lunch can get very crowded and that can impact water and naan basket refills.

Similarly dinner is great but can get expensive (especially if you are a naan fiend). The caliber of service increases dramatically when the lunch rush isn't on and our waiter was very attentive and helpful.

If you are looking to try as many new things as you can for lunch this is a great place to go!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"The biggest mistake I've made this week is leaving my leftover curry at the table. This place is absolutely delicious, and I plan on coming back as soon as possible.

I came here with a lovely group of people for dinner. I made a mental note that this restaurant offered a lunch buffet so I plan on revisiting for this aspect. The restaurant has a calm, Indian decor with an explosion of amazing smells and spices. It's also pretty spacy, so you won't find yourself bumping elbows or weaving around people.

Menu is huge, and it contains everything from lamb to chicken and veggies to dessert. I  ordered the chicken jalfrezie with a side of plain naan. Absolutely heavenly; how did they achieve such a creamy texture without dairy?! I'll never know. Hours later, my stomach is still happy. Chicken was moist, and the naan was fluffy and crunchy. Everything about my dinner experience here was lovely.

Our waters were refilled constantly, which is always a huge plus when eating spicy foods. The restaurant wasn't too busy, so my experience here was pretty positive overall. I love Indian food, and Madison has proven that this city can make some great curry. Yes, yum, yay!"
Maharani Restaurant,non-vegetable dinner for 2,"This 5 star review is for their lunchtime buffet.  There was so much variety and each dish was delicious!  I've had Indian buffets before, but this is hands down the BEST one I have ever been to.  They really don't skimp on the good stuff (including garlic naan!)  

We also came here for dinner, which was equally delicious but much pricier and obviously less variety.  The lunch buffet is totally worth it if you don't mind being in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon."

Google is telling me that the difference between palak paneer and saag paneer is that palak is only spinach. The mixed vegetable curry was fine, but nothing worth writing home about (though, everything is worth telling Yelp about, I guess). I think it's worth noting that the rice was delicious, and I ate too much of it.

The service was okay. The food took a very long time to come out: I believe we waited around 35 minutes, and the restaurant was more than half empty at dinner time on Saturday night.

If I'm ever back in Madison and craving Indian food, I'd return if I couldn't find an alternative!"
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"Recent dinner experience at the Maharani was somewhat disappointing, It was crowded, but no excuse for the barely courteous service, dishes ordered not being delivered, etc. My mixed vegetable curry was hot, but lacked the subtle mix of spices that goes into good Indian cuisine. The vegetables were overcooked,lacked flavor. My dining companion was similarly underwhelmed by his lamb dish. Perhaps best to stick with the lunch buffet here. If they continue to offer dinner, they should ramp up the quality of the cooking and the service."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"Delicious food! We came here for dinner in a Saturday. Panneer was tasty and had a great texture, naan was perfectly cooked. Lamb was tender. Looking forward to the lunch buffet."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"They get points for having an insane line-up of naan, perhaps 10 if my memory serves me, and my vegetable curry was really rocking, but the place loses major points for it's staff. Inattentive, unkind, and almost abrasive at times. I'm not sure if it was an off night, because few other reviews mention this point, but it really soured my evening. I'll likely head back to try their lunch buffet, where services simply isn't as important, but I find that there's a wealth of Indian restaurants in town, and if I'm doing dinner at one of them, it likely won't be Maharani."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"Maharani is always at the top of our to-eat list: the food, the service, the location, the FOOD! all make this a really top-notch Indian restaurant.  I know that the dinner menu is great, but we hardly ever make it here for dinner, just because the lunch buffet is so impressive and reasonably-priced (there's a student discount, too). The naan is baked fresh and brought right to your table, the chutneys and sauces complement the food nicely, the samosas are perfectly dense and crispy, and the spices in the main dishes are just right (even though I could probably take it a little spicier).  And the waiters are always so attentive--Preet is especially wonderful! I love Maharani!"
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"Once you get over the fact that you seem to be the only person talking in the restaurant because it's such an expansive place, you get lost in the large, delicious portions and steamy, buttery naan. The place doesn't look fancy enough for the prices on the dinner menu (about $13-16), but the food is good enough to avoid regret. 

If you don't want anything specific, the buffet is well worth it- all of the dishes always look steaming hot and fresh and there are at least 20+ different items (plus dessert) to choose from...all for only $8.95.

in fact, i wish i was there right now."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"I love this place. Lunch buffet is pretty good, but sometimes I can't get what I want, so I often go for dinner too. My favorites are veg samosa - which I eat with onion chutney, and Paneer Tikka Masala - Hot, spicy one. LOVE IT LOVE IT! If you are a student, they give you 10% off- so please do use them. it's my top favorite restaurant in town."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"I used to go to this restaurant often and enjoyed the jovial very friendly staff and reasonably good (sometimes very good) food in the buffet. Now I had not been there for a while, but went for lunch buffet today- with a guest, unfortunately. 

There seems to have been a change in ownership and/or staff. The demeanor of the new staff was very sour. Especially the woman who works there looked like it would be very painful for her to crack a smile or utter a friendly or welcoming word. The men floated around like shadows- forget about any personal touch. I felt very uncomfortable.

For the food-- I used to love the Rasam soup. Now it was more like a super salty brine. There also were really no vegetables-- the only choice was a mushy broccoli/potato mush. Broccoli is not even a real Indian vegetable. The grilled fish was reasonably good, as was the biryani (hence two stars). 

Finally, the restaurant no longer offers free parking, as they used to in the adjacent garage. One now has to search for paid street parking, making it much harder to eat here.

So- if you ate here before and liked it-- be warned on all accounts. There are better Indian food options in the Madison area, e.g. Taste of India on Monroe Street, and Swagat in Middleton- both of which also have convenient parking."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"The best Indian food in Madison! Really fast and friendly service whether you eat in for dinner or lunch buffet or get take out. In a perfect world, I would have their fluffy buttery naan with every meal every day of my life."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"Indian food is generally expensive and this place is no exception. We ordered the veg dinner for 2 and it was way too much food which we were happy to pack and take home. The curries are nice and flavorful. We had samosas, mulligatawny soup, malai kofta, mix veg and daal (you can switch the curries with your choice of entre) we finished with gulag jamun which were not so great."
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,One star just because the food is good. Be prepared to wait 2 hours to see a waiter. The manager is also incompetent and a horrible at customer service. We had to ask waiters to bring things like water before finally debating on leaving without paying after no one gave us our check. Ended up paying the manager directly and storming off after a terrible dinner. At least the food was good...
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"I've eaten at Maharani both for their lunch buffet and for dinner.

When it comes to their lunch buffet where Maharani truly excels is selection. They have the widest selection available in the Madison area which allows you to try more things -- half the point of a lunch buffet, in my opinion.

The lunch buffet has had consistently good quality food for the several times I've been there. They also do have some spicy dishes for those who are concerned about the lack of authenticity in the heat at most Indian buffets and fortunately by having more dishes available they keep service accessible to most people.

Lunch can get very crowded and that can impact water and naan basket refills.

Similarly dinner is great but can get expensive (especially if you are a naan fiend). The caliber of service increases dramatically when the lunch rush isn't on and our waiter was very attentive and helpful.

If you are looking to try as many new things as you can for lunch this is a great place to go!"
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"The biggest mistake I've made this week is leaving my leftover curry at the table. This place is absolutely delicious, and I plan on coming back as soon as possible.

I came here with a lovely group of people for dinner. I made a mental note that this restaurant offered a lunch buffet so I plan on revisiting for this aspect. The restaurant has a calm, Indian decor with an explosion of amazing smells and spices. It's also pretty spacy, so you won't find yourself bumping elbows or weaving around people.

Menu is huge, and it contains everything from lamb to chicken and veggies to dessert. I  ordered the chicken jalfrezie with a side of plain naan. Absolutely heavenly; how did they achieve such a creamy texture without dairy?! I'll never know. Hours later, my stomach is still happy. Chicken was moist, and the naan was fluffy and crunchy. Everything about my dinner experience here was lovely.

Our waters were refilled constantly, which is always a huge plus when eating spicy foods. The restaurant wasn't too busy, so my experience here was pretty positive overall. I love Indian food, and Madison has proven that this city can make some great curry. Yes, yum, yay!"
Maharani Restaurant,vegetable dinner for 2,"This 5 star review is for their lunchtime buffet.  There was so much variety and each dish was delicious!  I've had Indian buffets before, but this is hands down the BEST one I have ever been to.  They really don't skimp on the good stuff (including garlic naan!)  

We also came here for dinner, which was equally delicious but much pricier and obviously less variety.  The lunch buffet is totally worth it if you don't mind being in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon."
Maharani Restaurant,saefood dinner special for 2,"We LOVED this place! We had the tandoori chicken, tandoori mixed grill and naan. Everything was so flavorful we wanted to keep eating even though the portions are so big you shouldn't clean your plate. We went at dinner on a Wednesday night, so it was pretty empty, but the service was excellent. Maharani just became one of our favorites in Madison!"
Maharani Restaurant,saefood dinner special for 2,"We stopped by at this restaurant on way from Wisconsin dells to chicago.
Food was disgusting, pricey and very small quantity. We ordered chicken biryani which had only two small pieces of chicken and had no taste. Service was also dicriminatory for white and non white people. White oeople will get great service and also a hot towel to wash hands athe end of dinner. Non white will not get that service.
to sum up bad food and pricey. You could get better food  for that price. We strongly donot recomnend this place to anyone.

Maharani Restaurant,saefood dinner special for 2,"The roach wasn't THAT big. Maybe thumbnail sized. I mean, I've seen ones in other countries the size of my entire thumb, so this was a lil' guy in comparison.

Mind you, that happened at the end of the meal so perhaps I should start at the beginning. 

We've been to Maharani countless times over the years. The food is usually good, the service is usually pretty lackluster.  However, this place has held a warm spot in my heart because it was one of our first date spots so we like to come back & reminisce.  

On this particular evening the service was worse than usual. We had to remind them we had ordered drinks, they brought out a completely wrong entree for the Mister, and the naan bread finally came out halfway through the meal. SIGH.  I think part of the service problem here is that they seem to do a team approach instead of sticking with assigned sections. So things just seem to fall by the wayside and who knows. Was this all foreshadowing what was to come?!  Perhaps. 

We finished eating & the server cleared away our plates. As she walked away I looked down to see a cockroach scurry across the table. It seemed to have been hiding under my plate.  The Mister, aghast, promptly trapped the rascal under a napkin and waited for the server to come back. She returned (to bring us our to-go boxes) and he lifted the napkin to show her the offending critter. She gasped and scooped it all up and went into the back. 

The Mister & I just stared at each other, incredulous. We figured this would be interesting... how would they handle it?  Would our dinner be comped? Would a manager come out, very apologetic?  

Soon after, she returned and informed us that pest control had been here earlier that day (presumably this was the excuse/explanation for why the roaches were on the run). She promptly handed us our bill and advised us she'd given us 20% off, explaining she'd only done that much since we'd already eaten our dinner.

SCREEEEEEEECCCCCHHH!   Wait.A.Minute.Here  So, what I'm understanding is that depending on at what point during your meal you have the bad experience, your discount will reflect that.  Good thing we didn't order dessert... if the roach had waited to show it's face until then it might have only been 5% off! 

I get it, restaurants can have roaches and many of them around town probably do. (Ick. I can't think about it too much or I'll end up a hermit). Regardless, it's pretty unusual for them to turn up on your table and what's critical after an incident like this is staff response which, disappointingly, was sorely lacking here."
Maharani Restaurant,saefood dinner special for 2,"The food deserves 5 stars, but the service really brings it down.
                                                                                                                                                                      
We were there several times for lunch buffet and never try their dinner. The service has always been pretty inattentive and sometimes unwelcoming, so never will try dinner.

Their naan bread is super great, always made fresh, so sometimes you gotta wait a little bit; most dishes are above level good--their chicken dishes are tender most of the time. The use of spices is excellent and exotic. I never tried fried food and they do look a bit soggy but again I can't tell. Dessert is always the same but I'm not bothered by that.

This is not a huge buffet, but the food they offer is great.  I like it this way because one really doesn't eat that much.  
 
The thing we don't like is the service, as mentioned. Sometimes servers don't even smile and come and go without saying anything.  Plates on your desk remain there.       

I don't think their servers do that on purpose, it's probably just the Indian way? However that does make the dinning experience sometimes uncomfortable.      Another thing is, when the food is empty, refills are slow or missing. It happens on weekends as well, days you pay more.

We still come back because the food is still pretty good. It's just such a shame that                                                                                                                                                                                                              they would have been such a great restaurant!"
Maharani Restaurant,saefood dinner special for 2,"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! I eat here about once a month. The chicken tikka masala is my go to dish. I also love their lamb shahi korma. All of their naan is delicious, they have lots of choices. I usually go for the cheese stuffed naan. If you order delivery expect about an hour wait. Dinner service is always consistent & very timely. I've never had to wait long to be seated. Be sure to finish your meal with a mango lassi. If you're craving Indian food, this is your place!"
Maharani Restaurant,saefood dinner special for 2,"So far my favorite Madison Indian restaurant.  Everything's always been fresh and tasty, and there are SO many choices!

Maharani Restaurant,saefood dinner special for 2,"Maharini is a large menu Indian food restaurant with all the classic vegetarian options. This restaurant is the kind of place that has some vegetarian options under the curries, but then also a vegetarian section, but then also a vegetables section: it's that kind of confusing restaurant. But, my friends and I found the small text that said vegetable dinner for two, and the rest is history.

The dinner came with samosas, palak paneer, mixed vegetable curry, malai kofta, rice, naan, and dessert. It started out with a lentil soup, which was not very good. Imagine buying chicken noodle soup, and instead of getting a broth with chicken and noodles in it, you get kind of a frothy, thicker soup that was the aforementioned soup put through a Ninja blender. That's what the soup was like: no lentils to be seen, a bit thicker, some lentil taste, and not very flavorful. 

The samosas were great. The crispy outside was nicely matched with the soft, potato inside. Out of the main dishes, I'd say only the malai kofta is worth recommending. The malai kofta was very good: the sauce was flavorful, not overwhelming, and it wonderfully seasoned each ball. The palak paneer should be avoided: its texture was quite unpleasant.

Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma sandwich,"Update:
Instead of spending time making his business better, the owner boldly tracks me down, calls a family member and threatens to sue if my review is not taken down. it is called freedom of speech sir! also they set up a fake account on yelp, give themselves a 5 star rating under the name Yamna F. then they send me a condescending message from that same account. can this experience get any worse?? we'll see.
people's bakery sells donuts and lunch sandwiches and is a fast food restaurant 15 miles away from Marrakesh (full service, dinner only restaurant), menus don't share a single common item, so no competition there, and this is by no means an endorsement. I made no attempt to hide my identity as I have no reason to, in fact I posted experience specific details to help you remember us. We went to Marrakesh, ordered food, paid for it and reviewed it like any other community member would, plain and simple. An apology was received from this merchant in a private message acknowledging overreacting and frustrations with Yelps reviews overall, despite the unprofessional comment they left on my review. This review will be changed to 2 stars if no additional ill will is displayed by this Establishment and their personal Yelp account under Yamna F."
Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma sandwich,"Ate here last night and the food was to die for! My husband and I decided to check it out with another couple. We started with the falafel, which was excellent - moist but not greasy. The makouda was also very good as well. 

Our husbands both had tagines - mine had the lamb and my friend's husband had the beef, which I had a bite of and it was very good. The dates in the beef were a delight. I had the chicken bastilla, which was dusted in powdered sugar and cinnamon. It was a sweet and savory delight!

For dessert we tried the flavor of sahara, which my friends were crazy about but I thought it was a little chewy. The mint tea was very good. 

The food was excellent and we all were very pleased and immediately were talking about when we could go back. Our waitress seemed new but she was very sweet and helpful. My only complaint was the bar menu - it seemed like there was a lot of wine but only a selection of five pretty standard beers. My friend also ordered a gin and tonic, pretty standard, but they didn't have tonic. I think he ended up having a gin and sparkling water, lol. 

Overall the food was very good, the staff was friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be going back here again."
Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma sandwich,"Strangely inconsistent reviews of this place. Many poor ones on Yelp,  yet it's rated the #1 restaurant in Madison on Trip Advisor. Our experience was very positive.  Between the three of us,  we had three variations on the tagine; chicken,  beef and lamb. Each was prepared quite differently and all were very tasty. 

The owner was our server. It was very obvious she has a passion for her cooking and the use of only high quality ingredients.  I felt prices were appropriate and portions were large. Recommended."
Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma sandwich,"Very disappointing.

I am a huge fan of Moroccan food and was excited to finally (again) have a Moroccan restaurant in town.  My previous experience of Moroccan restaurants is that they have a wide variety of nicely flavored/spiced foods that satisfy the soul.  My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant last night and were very dissatisfied. We ordered the lamb tagine and lamb couscous

Here are some of the reasons I felt so disappointed with our meal.

PRICE:  The food is priced quite high for the the quantity and quality.  Each dish arrives ala cart. There is no salad, soup or bread included with the entree.  At $15-17 for main dish, the meal would top $19-24 when adding a salad or soup.  

PORTION SIZE:  The portion size was very small and included about 3 oz of lamb.  The overal size of the meal was closer to what one would expect for lunch .  For $16-17, this seemed extremely high priced.

SEASONING:  The dishes were not seasoned as one would expect for Moroccan food.  They were quite bland without any apparent seasoning or spices . The chef had a very heavy hand with the salt.  We both commented on how very salty the food was...to the point of discomfort.  The couscous dish arrive without any sauce or juice, making the food seem very dry.

SERVICE:  The service was slow and unattentive.  The food took about 30 minutes to arrive.  It seems with this type of slow service, the restaurant would provide at least flatbread at the table to keep diners occupied.  Our waitress did not return to check in after the food was served and only asked how things were after we had finished.  We said it was ""okay"" and she seemed satisfied with that?

AMBIENCE:  The new decor is pleasant.  However, the restaurant did not have a welcoming feel due to the lack of staff engagement.  We walked out the door after paying and there was no ""thank you"" or ""good bye"" or any staff in sight to even notice we were leaving.    

I'm very sad to have had such a disappointing experienced at Marrakesh, and wish I could have provided a better review."
Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma sandwich,"So, this is my first try at Moroccan food and I simply love it! I've tried several Mediterranean place all over the States before, but this is by far my favorite Mediterranean place. Here's how it went down!

Pros:

1) Food is really tasty. And let's face it, how many places are there in Madison where you can get Moroccan food? I had the Chicken Tagine -chicken was perfectly cooked and covered in this mouthwatering sauce. My boyfriend and I basically finished almost every drop of the sauce, pouring it over our delicious saffron rice. Waiter said it's made of lots of spices, which all combined makes the most wonderful taste. I also made a rather strange request of substituting some of the ingredients with those matched with the Beef Tagine, but the waiter was pretty cool about it. I received the dish exactly how I asked for. Boyfriend had the beef kabob, which really, is probably pretty hard to mess up. He liked it.

2) Small menu. Reduces the amount of decision-making I have to make.

3) Decor is prettty awesome! They seated us in this comfy couches and I loved that we had privacy because there was nobody else in our seating section.

4) Because it's our first time sampling Moroccan food, waiter let us try some Moroccan mint tea. It's good but can taste a bit strange at first. Best part is it came in a cute little teapot and teacups, and the waiter poured out the tea most professionally (even though the teapot was boiling hot when I tried to repeat the same feat.)

Cons:

1) Service is pretty slow. This is a good and a bad thing. Good is, the waiter, unlike waiters in a lot of American restaurants, doesn't come pester you every five minutes. Bad is, we waited at least ten minutes for him to take our credit card so that we can up and leave. 
 
2) Dishes are rather pricey for the serving size. 

If you're sick of the standard American/Asian places around this area, then I'd say you should definitely check this place out at least once. Good food but pricey."
Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma sandwich,"We ate here in the first week they were open. The service was really, really slow, but I suspect that will improve as they figure things out, and it is not the reason for the 2 star review. The food was. 

At first, things seemed great. We were promptly seated (although we were only the second table there) and promised a complimentary Turkish tea. After about 10 minutes the tea arrived. It was herbal, sweet, and delicious. However, we had not seen our waiter at all between being seated and getting the tea, so we didn't order until then and it felt slow. 

We started with the hummus, which was very good, and accompanied by a wonderful light, slightly chewy bread. For a main course, I ordered the Chicken Tagine, and my husband got the Beef Tagine. Both were disappointing. The chicken was dry and overcooked, which is a little odd for a tagine dish. There was very little sauce, and two small strips of preserved lemon and a few olives. It also was absolutely under seasoned and under salted. The beef tagine was also overcooked, dried out, and tough. It was also a very cheap cut of beef, a very fibrous cut (like chuck) and honestly, for a $15 dish, I expect a little higher quality meat. It was literally about $3 worth of beef, with a hard cooked egg and a few prunes. It was also under seasoned, which given the description on the menu was surprising. 

Overall, it felt like the meal (at about $50 total with tax and tip - no drinks) was not worth the price, and I do not often say it. It's too bad, because the Shish Cafe (which used to occupy the space) was really excellent."
Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma sandwich,"Horrible horrible experience.

We came in there for lunch, it was not even that busy, but we had to wait for good 10 minutes in the hall before anyone was able to help us. Then the manager (owner?) came in and said he would be helping us today as there were no waiters available.   He sat us down and then went away to chat with another customer, which he did for another good 5 minutes before bringing us the menus.  We ordered some shawerma and it was disgusting- overcooked, tough as a leather shoe, completely unseasoned, etc.  I barely ate any of mine.  They also wanted to charge us for a piece of bread.  I was surprised that water was free.  During the whole meal the manager was too busy chatting up with someone else to even come and check on us.  Nobody even offered us extra water, I had to find him and ask  him for some. 

The only good thing about the restaurant is the decor.  But the food is not worth the price."
Marrakesh,beef tagines,"Ate here last night and the food was to die for! My husband and I decided to check it out with another couple. We started with the falafel, which was excellent - moist but not greasy. The makouda was also very good as well. 

Our husbands both had tagines - mine had the lamb and my friend's husband had the beef, which I had a bite of and it was very good. The dates in the beef were a delight. I had the chicken bastilla, which was dusted in powdered sugar and cinnamon. It was a sweet and savory delight!

For dessert we tried the flavor of sahara, which my friends were crazy about but I thought it was a little chewy. The mint tea was very good. 

The food was excellent and we all were very pleased and immediately were talking about when we could go back. Our waitress seemed new but she was very sweet and helpful. My only complaint was the bar menu - it seemed like there was a lot of wine but only a selection of five pretty standard beers. My friend also ordered a gin and tonic, pretty standard, but they didn't have tonic. I think he ended up having a gin and sparkling water, lol. 

Overall the food was very good, the staff was friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be going back here again."
Marrakesh,beef tagines,"Strangely inconsistent reviews of this place. Many poor ones on Yelp,  yet it's rated the #1 restaurant in Madison on Trip Advisor. Our experience was very positive.  Between the three of us,  we had three variations on the tagine; chicken,  beef and lamb. Each was prepared quite differently and all were very tasty. 

The owner was our server. It was very obvious she has a passion for her cooking and the use of only high quality ingredients.  I felt prices were appropriate and portions were large. Recommended."
Marrakesh,beef tagines,"So, this is my first try at Moroccan food and I simply love it! I've tried several Mediterranean place all over the States before, but this is by far my favorite Mediterranean place. Here's how it went down!

Pros:

1) Food is really tasty. And let's face it, how many places are there in Madison where you can get Moroccan food? I had the Chicken Tagine -chicken was perfectly cooked and covered in this mouthwatering sauce. My boyfriend and I basically finished almost every drop of the sauce, pouring it over our delicious saffron rice. Waiter said it's made of lots of spices, which all combined makes the most wonderful taste. I also made a rather strange request of substituting some of the ingredients with those matched with the Beef Tagine, but the waiter was pretty cool about it. I received the dish exactly how I asked for. Boyfriend had the beef kabob, which really, is probably pretty hard to mess up. He liked it.

2) Small menu. Reduces the amount of decision-making I have to make.

3) Decor is prettty awesome! They seated us in this comfy couches and I loved that we had privacy because there was nobody else in our seating section.

4) Because it's our first time sampling Moroccan food, waiter let us try some Moroccan mint tea. It's good but can taste a bit strange at first. Best part is it came in a cute little teapot and teacups, and the waiter poured out the tea most professionally (even though the teapot was boiling hot when I tried to repeat the same feat.)

Cons:

1) Service is pretty slow. This is a good and a bad thing. Good is, the waiter, unlike waiters in a lot of American restaurants, doesn't come pester you every five minutes. Bad is, we waited at least ten minutes for him to take our credit card so that we can up and leave. 
 
2) Dishes are rather pricey for the serving size. 

If you're sick of the standard American/Asian places around this area, then I'd say you should definitely check this place out at least once. Good food but pricey."

At first, things seemed great. We were promptly seated (although we were only the second table there) and promised a complimentary Turkish tea. After about 10 minutes the tea arrived. It was herbal, sweet, and delicious. However, we had not seen our waiter at all between being seated and getting the tea, so we didn't order until then and it felt slow. 

We started with the hummus, which was very good, and accompanied by a wonderful light, slightly chewy bread. For a main course, I ordered the Chicken Tagine, and my husband got the Beef Tagine. Both were disappointing. The chicken was dry and overcooked, which is a little odd for a tagine dish. There was very little sauce, and two small strips of preserved lemon and a few olives. It also was absolutely under seasoned and under salted. The beef tagine was also overcooked, dried out, and tough.

Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma,"Update:
Instead of spending time making his business better, the owner boldly tracks me down, calls a family member and threatens to sue if my review is not taken down. it is called freedom of speech sir! also they set up a fake account on yelp, give themselves a 5 star rating under the name Yamna F. then they send me a condescending message from that same account. can this experience get any worse?? we'll see.
people's bakery sells donuts and lunch sandwiches and is a fast food restaurant 15 miles away from Marrakesh (full service, dinner only restaurant), menus don't share a single common item, so no competition there, and this is by no means an endorsement. I made no attempt to hide my identity as I have no reason to, in fact I posted experience specific details to help you remember us. We went to Marrakesh, ordered food, paid for it and reviewed it like any other community member would, plain and simple. An apology was received from this merchant in a private message acknowledging overreacting and frustrations with Yelps reviews overall, despite the unprofessional comment they left on my review. This review will be changed to 2 stars if no additional ill will is displayed by this Establishment and their personal Yelp account under Yamna F."

Marrakesh,lunch beef shawarma,"Very disappointing.

I am a huge fan of Moroccan food and was excited to finally (again) have a Moroccan restaurant in town.  My previous experience of Moroccan restaurants is that they have a wide variety of nicely flavored/spiced foods that satisfy the soul.  My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant last night and were very dissatisfied. We ordered the lamb tagine and lamb couscous

Here are some of the reasons I felt so disappointed with our meal.

PRICE:  The food is priced quite high for the the quantity and quality.  Each dish arrives ala cart. There is no salad, soup or bread included with the entree.  At $15-17 for main dish, the meal would top $19-24 when adding a salad or soup.  

PORTION SIZE:  The portion size was very small and included about 3 oz of lamb.  The overal size of the meal was closer to what one would expect for lunch .  For $16-17, this seemed extremely high priced.

SEASONING:  The dishes were not seasoned as one would expect for Moroccan food.  They were quite bland without any apparent seasoning or spices . The chef had a very heavy hand with the salt.  We both commented on how very salty the food was...to the point of discomfort.  The couscous dish arrive without any sauce or juice, making the food seem very dry.

SERVICE:  The service was slow and unattentive.  The food took about 30 minutes to arrive.  It seems with this type of slow service, the restaurant would provide at least flatbread at the table to keep diners occupied.  Our waitress did not return to check in after the food was served and only asked how things were after we had finished.  We said it was ""okay"" and she seemed satisfied with that?

AMBIENCE:  The new decor is pleasant.  However, the restaurant did not have a welcoming feel due to the lack of staff engagement.  We walked out the door after paying and there was no ""thank you"" or ""good bye"" or any staff in sight to even notice we were leaving.    

I'm very sad to have had such a disappointing experienced at Marrakesh, and wish I could have provided a better review."

Great China,plain fried rice,Fried rice is very dry and the General Tso isn't really spicy. Portions are pretty good size. Never had them mess up my order which is good. Delivery is on part with other places.
Great China,plain fried rice,"This is a solid place for some fast chinese food.  We always order General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Chicken fried rice, cheicken/vegitable lo mein and crab rangoon.

Great China,plain fried rice,"I'm not a total snob. 

I lied, I'm kinda a snob, particularly about ethnic food. The most ethnic thing about this place is the name, it's that bad. 

I would have been quite confused even if I were not a snob.

Long story short, chow mein with no noodles. WHAT? I have never in my life heard this. Chow mein literally means ""fried noodles"". I ordered shrimp fried noodles and got grocery store frozen shrimp on saucy lettuce with rice. 

Best part of this meal was the mountain dew. Don't judge me for drinking Dew either. This was my work lunch and the sugar/caffiene combo kick in the face was a valid need. 

I think my egg roll committed suicide. Just now. 

I'm totally eating this food as I write this and I'm only becoming more and more convinced that I ordered this food as some sort of punishment. The fact that it's this bad and I'm still eating it tells me I need to see my therapist again because self-harm is wrong."
Great China,plain fried rice,"I ordered from Great China last night and had the worst food ever. I ordered general tsao's chicken and house special friend rice. The food was delivered 40+ minutes after the order, was barely warm and had little to no flavor. I am also pretty sure the rice was old. For $22 dollars this was no where near satisfactory.  I will not be ordering from this restaurant again."
Great China,plain fried rice,"This is definitely a place you would want to go for carry out or delivery only. There's a few tables inside, but no atmosphere whatsoever. That being said, we order from great China on a fairly regular basis and find it to be consistent. They have never messed up our order and normally say 30-45 minutes for delivery, but it ends up being more like 15-20 minutes, which is great. Delivery is free ($10 minimum order) and they always have coupons on their menu for free crab rangoons or fried rice (depending on how much your order was). I've heard that other Chinese restaurants in the area tatse better, but they are also a bit more expensive. I'm not a Chinese food connoisseur, so  for me this is just fine and I have no complaints!"
Great China,plain fried rice,"Good and very cheap for both lunch and dinner. Best cheap chinese food in the area! Crab rangoon free with lunches. Bought dinner for four people, lo mein noodles, chicken egg foo young, chicken fried rice, and general tso's chicken, and it was less than $30 bucks."

Great China,steamed white rice,"I ordered from Great China last night and had the worst food ever. I ordered general tsao's chicken and house special friend rice.

Itzza Pizza,side of mild peppers- pepperoncini,"Today my hubby and I adventure ourselves to try this pizza place for the first time, I placed the order online and the promised time was 7:15pm, it was 7:23 and no sound at the door. We called and the person sounded kind of confused and busy until he decided to call the driver to check on the time and said he would be here shortly. Finally, he showed up and we were happy to see him. 

We ordered two pepperoni rolls, a garden salad and a customized pizza with onions, ham, pineapple and pepperoni. Once I opened the box, my mouth started to salivate, it was very pretty to look at, the first bite ahhhhhhh......a delectable surprise, it had a nice interesting""grilled"" flavor, even the smell, it reminded me of ""carne asada"", not greasy at all and I loved the fact that the meats tasted mild, not very salty like other places. I agree the crust could be enhanced but I liked it, sometimes simple finds a  strange way to satisfy you ;)  

The pepperoni rolls were too soft for my taste with nothing special on them. The salad was the basic one, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots; However, the Italian dressing I asked for was definitely homemade and that is rare to find specially in a fast food restaurant, bonus!"
Itzza Pizza,side of mild peppers- pepperoncini,"Itzza Pizza is the replacement for Gumby's on Madison's near west side

I had the chicago style stuffed pizza and it was good (very big!), but nothing like authentic gino's east or lou malnati's in chicago. The sauce, crust, cheese, and toppings were pretty average and what you would find at places like pizza di roma or glass nickel, at a little cheaper price.

The one thing this place has that no one else does: PEPPERONI ROLLS. Gumby's had them and they were the best and these are even better!! They're soft, chewy, and come with a side of what tasted like thousand island dressing with a kick. Very awesome.

I would rank this place average in every single quality: taste, presentation, location, delivery speed. But the pepperoni rolls won me over. Definitely worth a try."
Itzza Pizza,side of mild peppers- pepperoncini,"Would give about 2.5 stars if I could. Had the regular pizza and breadsticks. Meh..  Not terrible, not memorable. Neither my husband or I cared for the sauce. Crust was ok. Definitely a lot of cheese if you like that. Generous with toppings. (Actually asked for mushrooms on half, got it on the whole pizza) 

Breadsticks were just pretty bad. Came with an odd cup of sauce on the side. I actually think it might have been a mistake? Tasted and looked like a watery thousand isle dressing? Yuck. Otherwise the topping was decent but the breadsticks were very bready. I know, breadsticks, right? But they weren't chewy in a focaccia way or melty like Olive Garden.. They were more like garlic Wonderbread?

Overall, we thought we would give it a try but I wish I had spent my $16 elsewhere and we won't be back."
Itzza Pizza,side of mild peppers- pepperoncini,"I hate to do this, really I do, but man, the Garlic Romano Deep Dish Chicago was the worst pizza of my life.  We had two pieces each and threw out the rest.  I actually went out and bought some other pizza from another west side location to rectify dinner.  

Look, I bet if I were to flash back to my college days and order this beast at 2 am, I would be really, really happy.  Trying to feed a family and we need the quality to go up, significantly.  The crust was dry and falling apart, the sauce way to salty and the toppings lost.  I hate battering local places, and this is deserved based exclusively on the quality of the product.   

I really really wanted to like this join, nice folks working there, easy to order, prompt service and the place is a little hard to find.  But damn, the pizza was not good."
The Brass Ring,veggie pita sandwich,"I've only been to the Brass Ring a few times, to play pool or to play trivia, but as pubs go, it's a nice one. The lighting level is good, not too bright or too dark, and it's very roomy and open inside while still retaining a sense of coziness, not an easy thing to pull off. 

The food is quite good, also. I'm kind of a BLT affectionata, and I really enjoyed my chipotle BLT with pub chips tonight. The bacon tasted freshly cooked, neither over or underdone, and was very flavorful. I usually don't like the bread to be grilled because of the heavy, greasy feel it gives to the sandwich, but Brass Ring grilled it in such a way that it was nicely crispy outside and not greasy at all. The chipotle mayo is served on the side and adds nice flavor and heat. The pub chips were a little burnt tasting, not the best I've had; the only off note. The dill pickle spear was on point, nicely garlicy and dilly, with no hint of sweetness. 

I paired it with a PsycHOPath tap beer (which was served in the correct glassware), and at $4 was a very good value. The tap beer list isn't huge, but has enough variety to keep most folks happy. (DC only drinks Budweiser, and of course they had that for him, so he was happy.) 

The service is the perfect balance of friendly and efficient, if only a wee bit slow. The trivia night was one of the better ones I've been to. We had a very good time, and will do it again soon."
The Brass Ring,veggie pita sandwich,"I've been to the Brass Ring for everything from a drink to watching a game to dinner and it's been enjoyable all around. My last visit was for lunch and I went for my go-to sandwich, the Smokestacker. A pile of very thinly sliced smoked turkey + crispy bacon + provolone is a great start, but when you add the chipotle mayo you've got one of my favorite turkey sandwiches in town. Add to that some delicious fries (which I also recommend you put the mayo to use on) and you've got one happy lady.

I also want to give a shout-out to their BBQ pulled pork on a ciabatta roll that they had available during the Badger basketball final - if you see that come up as a special, it's a good choice if you want to mix it up from their regular menu.

The only snafu I've experienced with them was the night of the basketball final - there was a lot of confusion with saving seats and moving tables back and forth - but in the end it worked out more or less, albeit our group ending up at tables on opposite sides of the dining area. If I end up there for another big game, I'll just be sure to ask for a manager to see what the situation is when we get there to avoid confusion."
The Brass Ring,veggie pita sandwich,"This place was awful. I just left. This is my second trip to Madison and my friend took me here. It was a Sunday morning and the place was nearly empty. 

Something was wrong with their water...we could not drink it. We ordered soda waters and they tasted fine. But they charged for soda water (whaaaaaat?? I know) 
I ordered the smokestack and the soup of the day. The soup was extremely salty and the sandwich was this: lower bun , turkey, bacon, cheese, bun top. Zero effort to make a decent sandwich on their part. 

My friend had the salmon salad and said it was fine. My other friend had a grilled cheese and he couldn't eat it...he said it was too cheesy, which sounds like well duh you ordered a grilled cheese, but it was more the fact that it was just not well balanced so it just felt like biting a slab of melted cheese.

Bad, bad experience."
The Brass Ring,veggie pita sandwich,"I work near-ish by, so this is a go to spot for when I want an upgrade from my standard Lean Cuisine lunch.

My personal favorite is the Bourbon St Salmon Salad

But these items are also very good:
Irish nachos
black and bleu caesar salad
Veggie Pita

Service is pretty fast, so is really good for lunch in the middle of the work day.

Also, the place is huge and has pool tables, so it is probably pretty awesome at night too."

The Brass Ring,grilled wild salmon sandwich,"I was invited out to Brass Ring for a big birthday party for a friend of mine.  Dinner first, with about 12 other ladies, and then a bit of Reggae and Dancehall next door so said birthday woman could shake it like a polaroid picture.  

Last time I was in Brass Ring was about, geez...... 8 years ago?  I was heavy into playing pool in my 20's and Brass Ring has got some great pool tables.  4 stars just for that fact.  Madison isn't really known for any great pool halls... Cueniques was closed down due to mobs of people deciding they wanted to fight in the street at 2am.... and well..... not much to speak of has taken Cuenique's place...  But Brass Ring is low key.. Not many tables, but enough... 

Add some good food to the mix and I will keep Brass Ring on my playlist.  While out with me ladies I ordered the Bourbon Street Salmon Salad, which boasts a 5 ounce Norwegian Salmon Filet grilled with a bourbon glaze and served on a bed of greens with parmesan cheese, onions, tomato & cucumber with a side of ""Texas Caviar.""  

Can I say Yum?..  I think I said Yum...   It was gooooooooood  

I've found myself a bit more of a homebody these days, especially in the winter - I tend to hibernate - so I passed up the dance party that ensued after dinner, but I witnessed the pictures and it looked like a great time.  

Like this place."
The Brass Ring,grilled wild salmon sandwich,"This place was awful. I just left. This is my second trip to Madison and my friend took me here. It was a Sunday morning and the place was nearly empty. 

Something was wrong with their water...we could not drink it. We ordered soda waters and they tasted fine. But they charged for soda water (whaaaaaat?? I know) 
I ordered the smokestack and the soup of the day. The soup was extremely salty and the sandwich was this: lower bun , turkey, bacon, cheese, bun top. Zero effort to make a decent sandwich on their part. 

My friend had the salmon salad and said it was fine. My other friend had a grilled cheese and he couldn't eat it...he said it was too cheesy, which sounds like well duh you ordered a grilled cheese, but it was more the fact that it was just not well balanced so it just felt like biting a slab of melted cheese.

Bad, bad experience."
The Brass Ring,soup of the day,"While the place is nice and the pools are of good quality, I will never return to the Brass ring. The reason? I experienced the worst service I ever had. We went there to drink a cocktail and play pool (so I can't say anything about food quality). The cocktails were OK - a bit too strong for my taste - and the bartender was haughty and unfriendly, to say the least. I guess that anyone can have a bad day, but the bartender probably had the worst day ever to be that disrespectful. Whether such behavior is an exception or frequent at the Brassing ring bar, I will never know as I do not intend to come back there anytime soon."

The Brass Ring,soup of the day,"I work near-ish by, so this is a go to spot for when I want an upgrade from my standard Lean Cuisine lunch.

My personal favorite is the Bourbon St Salmon Salad

But these items are also very good:
Irish nachos
black and bleu caesar salad
Veggie Pita

Service is pretty fast, so is really good for lunch in the middle of the work day.

Also, the place is huge and has pool tables, so it is probably pretty awesome at night too."
The Brass Ring,roast beef sandwich au jus,"I've only been to the Brass Ring a few times, to play pool or to play trivia, but as pubs go, it's a nice one. The lighting level is good, not too bright or too dark, and it's very roomy and open inside while still retaining a sense of coziness, not an easy thing to pull off. 

The food is quite good, also. I'm kind of a BLT affectionata, and I really enjoyed my chipotle BLT with pub chips tonight. The bacon tasted freshly cooked, neither over or underdone, and was very flavorful. I usually don't like the bread to be grilled because of the heavy, greasy feel it gives to the sandwich, but Brass Ring grilled it in such a way that it was nicely crispy outside and not greasy at all. The chipotle mayo is served on the side and adds nice flavor and heat. The pub chips were a little burnt tasting, not the best I've had; the only off note. The dill pickle spear was on point, nicely garlicy and dilly, with no hint of sweetness. 

I paired it with a PsycHOPath tap beer (which was served in the correct glassware), and at $4 was a very good value. The tap beer list isn't huge, but has enough variety to keep most folks happy. (DC only drinks Budweiser, and of course they had that for him, so he was happy.) 

The service is the perfect balance of friendly and efficient, if only a wee bit slow. The trivia night was one of the better ones I've been to. We had a very good time, and will do it again soon."
The Brass Ring,roast beef sandwich au jus,"I've been to the Brass Ring for everything from a drink to watching a game to dinner and it's been enjoyable all around. My last visit was for lunch and I went for my go-to sandwich, the Smokestacker. A pile of very thinly sliced smoked turkey + crispy bacon + provolone is a great start, but when you add the chipotle mayo you've got one of my favorite turkey sandwiches in town. Add to that some delicious fries (which I also recommend you put the mayo to use on) and you've got one happy lady.

I also want to give a shout-out to their BBQ pulled pork on a ciabatta roll that they had available during the Badger basketball final - if you see that come up as a special, it's a good choice if you want to mix it up from their regular menu.

The only snafu I've experienced with them was the night of the basketball final - there was a lot of confusion with saving seats and moving tables back and forth - but in the end it worked out more or less, albeit our group ending up at tables on opposite sides of the dining area.

The Brass Ring,grilled cheese sandwich,"I've been to The Brass Ring a number of times to play pool, shuffleboard, and/or darts (all while drinking beer).  

But last night I went for my first ever trivia night and it was a lot of fun!
It was easy and the staff was so welcoming even though it was my first time joining in.  What's so great is that it is free to play, but you can win $40, $20, or $10 based off your score. If you want to have a fun night with your friends, I definitely recommend going Thursdays (starts at 7:30) or on Sunday (starts at 5:30).  

If you don't want to do trivia, that's ok!  The Brass Ring offers a million other activities that are fun to do sober or while sipping on your favorite adult beverage.  They also serve food and have tables throughout the building. 

It's also a great spot to start your night out if you plan on seeing a show at The High Noon.  It is located right next door! 

Usually I like more low-key places to hang out.  I find places that are large, and noisy to be a little overwhelming, but I've always had a great time when visiting.  

The only reason that  I am not giving 5 stars is that my friends and I ordered some nachos (twice...don't ask) last night and the cheese wasn't melted all the way.  We still ate all of them (twice), so it must not have been that bad.  Ha. :)"

The Brass Ring,california chicken sandwich,"I went here on a Saturday afternoon.  We were able to park, but took the last available space.  

Inside is fairly nice and there are a ton of pool tables, if that's your thing.  Prices were reasonable.

The wait staff weren't great.  I'm not sure if they were overworked or what, but my table and the table behind us had to repeat orders.  I got a spicy chicken sandwich and started feeling sick on the drive home.  I'm not blaming the Brass Ring for that, but it certainly cemented feeling ill with going to the Brass Ring.  It might be worth it for customers to make the extra trek into the downtown to get better food, service and atmosphere for the same price."

I had their house special old fashion, I'd pass on that one again. I've found the best place to get a great old fashion is on Sheboygan county. Any where else is disappointing, no extra fixings and a bit too bitter.  The food was great and they had a PBR tall boy special $2.75. The only real complaint was the lighting outside as in you can't see your food. It was 76 at 9pm, we wanted enjoy the warm weather.  The service was great!"

If I end up there for another big game, I'll just be sure to ask for a manager to see what the situation is when we get there to avoid confusion."
The Brass Ring,california chicken sandwich,"This place was awful. I just left. This is my second trip to Madison and my friend took me here. It was a Sunday morning and the place was nearly empty. 

Something was wrong with their water...we could not drink it. We ordered soda waters and they tasted fine. But they charged for soda water (whaaaaaat?? I know) 
I ordered the smokestack and the soup of the day. The soup was extremely salty and the sandwich was this: lower bun , turkey, bacon, cheese, bun top. Zero effort to make a decent sandwich on their part. 

My friend had the salmon salad and said it was fine. My other friend had a grilled cheese and he couldn't eat it...he said it was too cheesy, which sounds like well duh you ordered a grilled cheese, but it was more the fact that it was just not well balanced so it just felt like biting a slab of melted cheese.

Bad, bad experience."
The Brass Ring,steak sandwich,"I've only been to the Brass Ring a few times, to play pool or to play trivia, but as pubs go, it's a nice one. The lighting level is good, not too bright or too dark, and it's very roomy and open inside while still retaining a sense of coziness, not an easy thing to pull off. 

The food is quite good, also. I'm kind of a BLT affectionata, and I really enjoyed my chipotle BLT with pub chips tonight. The bacon tasted freshly cooked, neither over or underdone, and was very flavorful. I usually don't like the bread to be grilled because of the heavy, greasy feel it gives to the sandwich, but Brass Ring grilled it in such a way that it was nicely crispy outside and not greasy at all. The chipotle mayo is served on the side and adds nice flavor and heat. The pub chips were a little burnt tasting, not the best I've had; the only off note. The dill pickle spear was on point, nicely garlicy and dilly, with no hint of sweetness. 

I paired it with a PsycHOPath tap beer (which was served in the correct glassware), and at $4 was a very good value. The tap beer list isn't huge, but has enough variety to keep most folks happy. (DC only drinks Budweiser, and of course they had that for him, so he was happy.) 

The service is the perfect balance of friendly and efficient, if only a wee bit slow. The trivia night was one of the better ones I've been to. We had a very good time, and will do it again soon."
The Brass Ring,steak sandwich,"I've been to the Brass Ring for everything from a drink to watching a game to dinner and it's been enjoyable all around. My last visit was for lunch and I went for my go-to sandwich, the Smokestacker. A pile of very thinly sliced smoked turkey + crispy bacon + provolone is a great start, but when you add the chipotle mayo you've got one of my favorite turkey sandwiches in town. Add to that some delicious fries (which I also recommend you put the mayo to use on) and you've got one happy lady.

Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic bread and house-made marinara,"Wife and I have always enjoyed our visits. We've only had the pizzas recently, but in the past I've loved to get the cheesey bread and the tomato bisque soup. Yum! My mom's not so impressed with it, but I know my wife and I love it. The pizzas tend to be a little less greasy then other pizza joints we frequent. Last time in even had a vegan pizza without cheese and enjoyed it. (Ok, we hadn't realized it didn't have cheese till it came, but we still liked it)."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic bread and house-made marinara,"Roman Candle Pizzeria has quickly become my favorite pizza place in Middleton.  Granted, there isn't a whole lot of competition in the area.  Regardless, Roman Candle consistently serves an excellent thin crust pizza and has a good tap selection.  I've never had a bad experience here, and I've never been to the Willy Street location so I can't compare.  The prices are a slightly high compared to other Middleton places but fair for what they offer, though I bet a made-to-order pizza could start to get pricey.  Overall it is a strong four star place, with only a few drawbacks.

I tend to always go with one of the specialties as I don't usually care to take the time to argue about the toppings on a made-to-order pie.  The specialties at Roman Candle are all good.  My personal favorite is the Professional, though had you told me that I'd really enjoy broccoli on a pizza a few years ago I'd never have believed it.  The jalepenos combine with the creamy alfredo sauce exceedingly well, and if it weren't for a desire to try the others I probably wouldn't have ever ordered anything else.  The signature Roman Candle pizza is another one of my favorites - I apparently love the spicy pizzas.  My last time there we went with the Pestoral.  At first I thought that it was a bit much, since a little pesto can go a long way for my taste.  However, by the second slice I was really enjoying it.  It was the kind of pizza that only works for me on crispy thin crust, which was perfect in balancing out the melted feta and mozzarella and the olive oil.  Also, the little fold-down trays for the pizza are really a brilliant idea.  I haven't ever tried the pasta here, but it is all RP's and on that alone I can recommend it.  Also, the appetizers here are all tasty.  The deluxe cheese breadsticks with marinara are a meal in itself, and the garlic bread with spinach and cheese is a standard.  I also want to try the shallot and bleu cheese filo wraps one of these times.  The tap selection changes from time to time, but there always seems to be a couple Lake Louies and of course Capital.

The drawbacks to the place are that service can be pretty slow, though the waitstaff always is apologetic about it.  I've never stopped for lunch, but a friend that works in the area has always said that it is quite busy.  The booths can be a bit uncomfortable, as they have hard backs.  Sometimes the young children can get a bit out of control, and the place can get a bit loud.  These are all fairly minor issues, and are all pretty common for downtown Middleton.  I haven't gotten delivery from this location so I don't know how fast it is, but it is free for orders over $12."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic bread and house-made marinara,"having never tried their williamson st. location, co-workers and i were happy to take a break from the office to check out the new restaurant in middleton.

when we walked in, the place was quite empty and we were immediately seated. after deciding that single slices were the way to go (getting six people to agree on toppings is no easy feat); we enjoyed jovial conversation... for a while. it felt like a long time to wait for pizza... the place started filling up, and the din increased, and finally! the waitress brought our cheese bread (basically a sauceless cheese pizza. talk about a profit-rendering food item!)

my spinach-feta stuffed slice was good. very feta-ey. i might have rather had a yummy slice of veggie pizza, but more than two toppings seemed expensive. the marinara sauce for the cheese bread was delicious. not too tangy, not to sweet... if it's what they use for their pizza sauce, then that's what will get me back there again to try an unstuffed slice.

over all, it was a good value for the dough, though they still seem to be getting their bearings at the second location; i'm assuming the lunch crowd on willy st is slightly less busy and time constrained than the one  in middleton."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic bread and house-made marinara,"I eventually went back to redeem the bread sticks coupon (I stopped at Papa Murphy's for a pizza). 
Once again the bread sticks were dry and seemed slightly over-cooked, not soft and chewy like the lady on the phone said they were supposed to be. At least they remembered the marinara sauce. This time they twisted the bread sticks instead of leaving them flat. 
I won't be returning."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic bread and house-made marinara,"Worst service ever. 

A few friends and I ordered two pizzas and some bread sticks for delivery and after an hour and a half, still no pizza! We called the restaurant and the staff told us the pizza was on it's way. We waited another 45 minutes to no avail. The pizza had still not arrived. We called the restaurant once again to cancel our order and they decided to mock us by saying they would check the oven and cancel our pizza. Great way to keep customers."
Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic bread and house-made marinara,"Just had the worst pizza of my life. It was all sauce, barely any cheese and overall a big disappointment. Called the manager; she told me that Margherita pizzas are usually not recommended for delivery or pickup. Hmm..never heard that one before and I wasn't made aware of this when I placed the order. . She offered no refund or replacement. I said nothing, I just wanted them to know because it was like having bread and sauce. Any good restaurant would offer some sort of compensation. I could have asked for one, I didn't call for that but it says a lot about them. We've liked their food in the past so this was interesting."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,bbq brisket beans,"This is a fish fry review.

Joey's Seafood and Grill is a nice, down-to-earth place with enough class to bring a casual date. Decor is pleasant with reddish wood tables and chairs, neutral upholstered booths, a brick back wall and exposed duct work. The effect is as if you're in a homey, modern loft. There's no ""strip mall"" feel here.

I've been here three times. Once was with my brother, once alone and the once with 4 of my friends. They were doubtful when I told them how good it was, but believers after the food (and the bill!) was delivered.

The fish simply can't be beat -- I've been three times and quality has been identical each trip, which is very impressive to me. For $12.00, you get all-you-can-eat haddock with 2 sides of your choice and mini corn muffins with honey butter. The fish is so good you simply cannot improve upon it. The smooth batter is light in texture, golden in color and crisp to the tooth. The flesh of the fish is flaky, silken and tender. Just wonderful. There are many alternatives to the haddock including cod, lake perch and Alaskan halibut. For these, there are varying prices for the fish chose and if you would like two or three pieces. There is also a ""triple play"" option (my term) that gets you one haddock, one cod and one perch. 

Besides the fish, the other great thing about fish fry here is the accompaniments. You get two choices from a list of ten (ten!!), including vegetables, various potatoes, and even red beans and rice. My choices are the potato cakes and the slaw.

Sides are varied in quality, so spread things out and see what you like. The potato cakes are 100% a must-try. They are crisp outside and smooth inside, with rich flavor of potato, cheese, cream and onion so light it could be chive. That's a compliment. Slaw is a little heavily-dressed for my taste, yet still crisp. The flavor and seasoning is spot on. To me, red beans and rice is almost a stew of red beans poured over the rice. Here it is the type where the beans are incorporated into the rice; not to my liking but still well-spiced, with both a light heat and a good depth of flavor. I've crunched maybe one or two french fries and they're good. The only side I would advise against is the hush puppies. They are cornmeal based and I strongly prefer flour hush puppies. My friends found them to be fine, so your mileage may vary.

Service is great. Waitstaff and bartenders are cheery; almost playful. They seem to sincerely enjoy working here. All of them are well-dressed in solid black articles of their choice. 

As for cocktails, I've have a few Wisconsin old-fashioneds; two were sours, one was sweet. They were serviceable.

However, as I said, this is a fish fry review. The fish fry here is the best I've had in the area, with excellent waitstaff and serviceable cocktails. Quality has been steady across several visits. I recommend the fish fry at Joey's Seafood and Grill with no hesitation."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,bbq brisket beans,Read some reviews so thought we would give Joey's a try. Pulled up to a strip mall where it is located and had second thoughts. Went on in and the minute we saw the inside felt better about our decision. Now for the food. There were 3 of us and we each had something different. I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Salmon. WOW this was an amazing choice! My son ordered the halibut and was delightfully impressed with it. My wife had a dish called Cioppino a seafood stew and was well pleased. Definitely would return!!!
Joey's Seafood & Grill,bbq brisket beans,"Went to Joey's on May 25 for lunch; not too crowed at noon.  Had  fish tacos served with black beans and coleslaw.  Fish was battered, fried and tasted good, but served on a flour tortilla which became a soupy, gooey mess.  They should use warm corn tortillas.  The taco filling was fairly tasteless; pico de gallo could have used some spices.  Black beans were bland; no flavor, maybe out of the can. (I d suggest a side of black beans and rice instead).   Also, since the tacos are made with coleslaw and the included side dishes are not described on the menu for this item,  the side of coleslaw was redundant.  Boring beans, flour tortillas, bland pico de gallo, redundant coleslaw = BORING FOOD!  Waitress was nice though."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,bbq brisket beans,"Pleasantly surprised and pleased with Joey's.    We were a little unsure of what to expect due to some negative reviews.   Stopped by for the first time and ordered takeout.   The place was very busy, a good sign.   The dishes on the tables looked delicious.  The staff seems happy and were pleasant, upbeat, talking casually with customers at the bar and also quick to break away and serve me.   The atmosphere is nice but could really use a larger space.   It's crowded.  But still it is neat and clean and everyone looks sharp and is in uniform.
The food came quickly.   When we got home, we dug in and boy was it good.   Two types of shrimp and calamari.   All tasted as good as it looked.   The sauces were very good too.   The potatoes were excellent, the coleslaw was good and made like we like it.  The hush puppies were a little dry but tasted good.   The rice and beans were nicely done and very good too.   
We are looking forward to going back for a sit down meal.   Thanks Joey's for a great set of food good portions and a fair price.  5 stars on flavor and service. 4 on atmosphere and presentation."
Joey's Seafood & Grill,bbq brisket beans,"Average. Ordinary. Not bad but not special, and prices are in the 15 to 25 average. Overcooked shrimp, salty crab legs, OK fish fry. Service OK. I have had a better meal at Red Lobster. Sides are ordinary. And not special either. Red beans are watery and seemed like from a can, not Louisiana style. Very limited tap beer selection. Some decent wine prices by the bottle, by the glass expensive. Nothing special on the wine list."
Asian Kitchen,66. dry sauteed string bean,"Some of the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted.

The low prices, large portions, and late hours have always been extremely attractive to me (mostly the inebriated, 2 am me), but after probably 10 trips to this establishment, I've finally called it quits.

While I've never experienced the bouts of food borne illness that some of my fellow yelpers have alluded to, I do agree that this place is FAR from clean. If you're going to order from here, you should make it delivery--at least then you don't have to look at the filth while you're waiting to receive your food. If you DO order delivery, make sure to check your order BEFORE the delivery guy leaves. On more than one occasion, I've received the wrong order and the delivery person had sped off before I had even opened the bag (or given him a tip!)

Things I've tried from here: 

EGG ROLL: dry and flavorless, and the only filling inside of it is shredded cabbage (how can cabbage be so dry????)

ORANGE CHICKEN: over-breaded, overly sweet, dry, and of terrible quality. If you cut into the pieces, the brown chicken on the inside is revealed

CRAB RANGOON: DRY, little to no crab flavor (certainly no pieces of crab....I'm convinced that it's just plain cream cheese inside and they're betting on the placebo effect creating some sort of crabby undertone)

GENERAL TSO'S TOFU: rubbery, overly sweet...just don't do it...it's so bad

FRIED RICE: hands down the WORST fried rice I've ever tasted in my entire life....I don't even think they fry it...it's (you guessed it) DRY, hard, there's no trace of egg in it at all, and it mostly just tastes like white rice that has been lightly coated in soy sauce. SERIOUSLY DO NOT GO THERE. DON""T GET THE FRIED RICE IT'S SO BAD I CAN'T STRESS IT ENOUGH

POTSTICKERS (STEAMED): they actually taste really freaking good....but the meat inside is questionable at best


All of that said, I have a good feeling that this place will continue to be a late-night staple for the foreseeable future, but I'm telling you: if you're looking for GOOD chinese food (perhaps for a girl's/guy's night in, movie marathon, late night study sesh, or literally any other occasion), STEER CLEAR OF ASIAN KITCHEN!!!!

My best Chinese food recommendation: FUGU Asian fusion on Gilman street. That place is BOMB."
China Wok,69. beef with snow peas,"I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon similar to my favorite Chinese place in Indy. This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.

In my phoenix and dragon I had five ""jumbo"" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The ""spicy chicken"" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird ""spicy"" sauce that wasn't very good.

I also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each. They're still fairly good, just not crab.

I suppose the worst part was delivery time. The confirmation email doesn't come with a estimated delivery. Whatever, my boyfriend and I expect 40 minutes like normal. 40 minute mark rolls around and we haven't gotten a call. Since our buzzer system isn't set up we were worried that they didn't see the note to call and were buzzing us. The person who answers says it's in the car and close. 20 minutes later we're still waiting. My boyfriend calls back and goes to give his info. The lady says, ""Oh, you just called. It's almost there,"" and that was it. Uhm. Ok. A little less than 10 minutes later and it arrives. The driver apologized and It was still hot. So there's that.

tl;dr small portions, not jumbo shrimp, not spicy, not very good, long wait, unfriendly staff on the phones, friendly drivers, and they litter my apartment building a lot."
China Wok,69. beef with snow peas,"I ordered takeout from here tonight. Eh. It was just okay. I ordered the hot and sour soup, which was a bit thin and greasy but otherwise okay tasting. I also ordered the chicken and snow peas. In my experience, this dish is supposed to be chicken, snow peas, maybe a few carrot slices, and a clear-ish sauce. Instead it came drenched in a brown sauce and had a ton of carrots, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. Not what I expected, plus the snow peas were really overcooked and had no ""snap"" whatsoever. I probably won't be going back here. On the plus side, the prices are very good, and $10.74 bought enough food for two meals or more. The food was hot when I picked it up, and the cashier was cordial."
China Wok,69. beef with snow peas,"I ordered delivery from this place. It took them about 40 min to deliver, which I think is a standard. Well, the food was alright - didn't wow me and my friend, but we didn't complain about it either.

I liked the fact that they serve not overly greasy chinese. We ordered pork chop suey, mixed vegetable, and beef with snow peas. All of them tasted  good without making my guts feel nauseous. 

One thing my friend and I didn't know - so in Midwest (or in Madison only?) ""chow mein"" is not a noodle dish .... .  So make sure to order ""Lo mein"" if you want that noodle dish. Chow mein is chop suey. I swear it's not like that in California!"
China Wok,69. beef with snow peas,"You know how you see a picture of food at a restaurant, you order it, only to have what is put on your plate barely resemble what you saw in the picture?  Well, you don't have to worry about this at China Wok.  What you get as your meal looks even better than the pictures above their counter.

I've dined at this carry out Chinese location numerous times over the past 2 years.  My office is only a mile or so away and it makes for a quick meal.  I must say, I feel like something has changed in the past year.  When I used to go, I felt like no matter what I ordered, it all looked/tasted the same. (ie sauce, color, vegetables, etc)  But for the past year or so, my coworker and I marvel at how great the food looks when it comes from the kitchen.  We primarily dine in.  We're practically giving each other high-fives, because we feel like we just scored big.

And the flavor is just as good as it looks.  I just ate at another carryout Chinese location and the quality of food reminded me how great China Wok is, so I jumped out to right this review.

I regularly get Kung Pao Chicken or Mongolian Beef.  My coworker exclusively gets General Tso's Chicken (this thing always looks amazing!)

Value is always great...we can get both of our lunches, i usually add an egg roll (75 cents) and he usually gets a soda and it costs us around $12 for both of us.  Quantity of food is also great.

As you can tell, I highly recommend this place.  Given it's a carryout Chinese place, I really should give it 5 stars for overcoming such an obstacle!"
Domino's Pizza,20 oz. soda,Dominos is dominos. But when I walk in and order and watch my pizza be ready for 40mins. I had to stand up and ask them to look at the name on the box an hour after I ordered. This dominos is slow. Drive 5 miles out of your way if you want it. Edit: our soda was flat. Seriously go get Ian's or drive out of your way for dominos don't go to this one

Taqueria Guadalajara,hurache mexicano,"GORDITA GORDITA GORDITA

get it! Chicken gordita. This is SO good. Think a traditional taco, but fried tortilla. and a little ""fatter"". 

Chicken taco - mexicano (cilantro + onion) - still a little bland (the chicken needs ""something"" in it).

Small space but they have 12 4-person tables. Bigger than expected. They have Jarritos and Victoria beer. 

Free chips and salsa - the mild is mild and the spicy is medium. Both very GREAT flavors."
Taqueria Guadalajara,hurache mexicano,"Taqueria Guadalajara is a small place bustling with people waiting to warm up with delicious Mexican food. 

I had the Huarache Mexicano, and was blown away by the flavor. Guac was also on point. 

It's a must visit if you're passing through Madison, and well priced too boot!"
Taqueria Guadalajara,hurache mexicano,"Establishments like this are the exact reason I am grateful for yelp.  We are currently crossing the country from Maine to Washington and have had to rely on either word of mouth, chain restaurants or (thankfully) yelp.  I can honestly say that we probably never would have found this gem if it had not been for yelp.

First of all, we ate at the counter in the front and watched all the magic in the kitchen.  It was warm upfront, but my husband cooled himself with a Negro Modelo, I enjoyed a mandarin soda and our daughter stuck with water.  Everyone was terrifically friendly.  It was a delight to watch all the cooking happening.  The food was incredible to boot.  I had a chicken chimichanga which came with rice, beans and lettuce, my husband had a burrito mexicano with a gordita on the side and our daughter had three chicken tacos.  Combine this with tortilla chips and some of the best salsa I have ever had and we were in heaven.  Just when we thought our meal couldn't get any better, one kindly gentleman who worked here gifted us with a green tamale, on the house.  It.  Was. AMAZING.  Fresh, perfect consistency and positively tasty.

And then there is the thing that drive this amazing establishment into overdrive:  The price.  The grand total for all of the delicious, tasty goodness above?  $26.  Seriously.  The three of us can hardly go out for breakfast at that price, let alone some of the best mexican food we have ever had.  

If you are in Madison run, don't walk, to Taqueria Guadalajara.  You will be delighted that you did."
Taqueria Guadalajara,hurache mexicano,"How have I not reviewed my favorite Madison Mexican joint?

This place is sooo good.  Free salsa and chips? Check. A nice assortment of Mexican Brews? Check.  Fresh Tamales? Check. The only thing they are missing is Margaritas. 

I swear you could order your food and have it served in the time its takes Univision to do a commercial break.  They are that fast.  

I had never had a huarache before coming here.  Now the Huarache Mexicano is my go to.  My gf loves the burritos.  Their tacos al pastor are a lesson in simple awesomeness.  

I actually came here up talk up their chicken chimichanga.  I was hungover and wanted some comfort food that only The Taqueria could offer.  I had heard the chimis were awesome but I never got around to trying the deep fried goodness.  Oh My God was it great.  It was cheesy fried awesome.   I don't want to know how many calories are in a deep fried chicken burrito.  The worst part about my last visit is now I know I like deep fried chicken burritos.  I didn't need to know that.  I was perfectly fine with regular burritos. Oh Well."
Taqueria Guadalajara,hurache mexicano,"A bunch of my friends and I had been meaning to try out this place because it is so close to where I live, usually looks busy, and we are curious people. We finally got around to it last night, and it was the best homemade Mexican food I have had yet in Madison!

The front part has a dining counter with a grill, which looked inviting, but we sat in the back part of the restaurant with tables. The two salsas they serve before the meal are great - although the green salsa was a bit more spicy than I prefer, it was still delicious, and I'm sure people with a higher tolerance for heat would absolutely love it.
  
I had a burrito mexicano (which comes with mild red salsa, sour cream and guacamole spread on the top to look like a Mexican flag) with steak. It tasted far better than any burrito I'd had in recent memory. I was surprised at how few beans were in it, but it may have been because the two people I was with ordered theirs with no beans and they came back a couple of times to make sure they had our order correct. I was happy with the staff there for that very reason and also because they were just pleasant to begin with.

For what you get, there's no beating the price, either :) I will definitely be back for more!"
Madistan,fish sandwich,"Madistan is a newbie but a goodie! It is a cute little place featuring a small menu of Pakistani/Fusion fast food. The food is cheap, quick and there is no skimping on flavor. For about $5 you can get a nicely seasoned and surprisingly large falafel sandwich with all the right fixins (I always ask for extra tzadziki because I'm a glutton, you prob should too) including pickled vegetables that add a refreshing bit of tang. 

The food here is great but the real draw is the owner, who is wonderfully friendly and welcoming every single time. His energy, mixed with the food quality, has turned me into a repeat customer--and a happy one at that. Cheers to good old-fashioned kindness & falafel!!!"
Madistan,fish sandwich,"Just tried it out today as a takeout dinner option and I was very impressed with the cheap prices and the food was much better than expected, it was great really. Especially the bread and amount of meat they give you in the sandwiches. However, if you are thinking about grabbing a bite really quickly it should be noted that from the time I ordered it took about 20 minutes until I got my sandwich and I was the only one in the store. But all in all great food and prices."
Madistan,fish sandwich,"Cheap isn't always the same as value.  Yes, Madistan is cheap but I was less then impressed with the quality of the entrees.  The falafel sandwich fell flat as the falafel balls were tough and the pita chewy.  The chicken biryani was well spiced but it was a tad greasy and the chicken rather dry.  Service was great and friendly.  Be warned that this is not ""fast"" food.  I have no qualms about waiting as long as it is worth it.  On my visit, it wasn't.  Maybe an off night so if I am in the area, I'll give it a second try."
Pita Pit,falafel,"For a fast food joint this place is great! The have tasty falafel which is really hard to find in this town. This place is really similar to subway in that you order your meal and then watch as they make it and tell them what you want in it. It is better than subway because there are more options for what to add into it as far as cheese, veggies, and sauces go. You also get a lot more food for your money and they have way more options for vegetarians. You can get either a wrap or a pita. I left full and satisfied. The people working there were very friendly and courteous."
Pita Pit,falafel,"I cock-blocked with a pita . . . . =(

I discovered this place during my trip out here for work.  I went in to order a pita and as the girl at the counter was making it, a guy walks in and she gets really excited.  They chat about their plans for the night because apparently he was going laser tagging, but she has to work until 10:30pm.  She abruptly has to kill the conversation to finish my order.  Pitas should never stand in the way of love.

White or wheat pita
Meat:  spicy chicken, beef, falafel, badger special!!!! (potatoes, bacon, cheese, jalapeños, oinions, green peppers,nspicy sauce) and a bunch of other choices.
Add ons: everything and anything:  spinach, romaine, alfalfa, tomato, hummus, olives, taziki, pickles, onions, pepperoncinis, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, etc.
9 diff sauces: mayo, sour cream, spicy chipotle, ranch, etc.

I hope I can find one in California . . . and not cock-block."
Pita Pit,falafel,"YUSSSSS FALAFEL AND PITA!!!!! Could life get any better?! I think not. The Pita Pit is the best place to go when you're drunk and need to shove food in your face, which is the exact reason why I made my first visit. I may not totally remember a lot of that night, but what I do remember is the Pita Pit. The place is great! The staff is nice, there is a lot to choose from, the food is cheap and you get a lot of it for your money's worth (I'm pretty sure my pita was the size of a small sedan). Overall, I can't wait to go back and I will definitely make it a place I stop by when I am in Madison."
Rocky Rococo,wheat n' meat,"You can count on a doughy, terrible, undercooked, greasy pizza unless you get the whole wheat crust. They make pizza on a  chain conveyor belt like Burger King does. You can't get  a good crust without an oven. They could care less as employee s can't burn pizza and this saves money and time. But if you get the whole wheat crust it turns out great! They have a good sauce and awesome sausages. Order a wholewheat Uncle Sal's and you will thank me. Plus you can feed 6 big people easily!"
Rocky Rococo,wheat n' meat,"Whole wheat crust a must! I agree with an earlier reviewer that the white crust is gross. Trust me, it is a huge difference!"
Asian House,lo mein lunch special,"The search for decent Chinese takeout in Madison continues. The food at this place (we ordered delivery) is nothing worth waiting 1.5 hours for. Greasy vegetable egg rolls which contain nothing but cabbage. Greasy lo mein. They clearly do not understand how to work with tofu, nor do they get how to deliver quality food in a timely fashion. The one plus was the vegetables were still crunchy. Just save your time and money and don't bother. Not even a good dousing of sriraccha can make their ho-hum food sparkle. The reviews I've seen from in-house diners do not provide any contrast to our delivery experience."

IHOP,bananas foster brioche french toast,"Took over 8 mins for server to come greet us. Not even 75% of tables full. My fiancé ordered the pancake platter, and I ordered bacon wrapped sirloin ($7 special) and some crepes. After a modest wait, the crepes came to the table, and the lady that delivered them (different from server) asked if we wanted another plate, or if my fiancé was going to have anything. I felt so embarrassed by that. I'm a pretty big guy, and when she looked at me when she said that, she looked disgusted. Apparently this happened because our server put this on a separate ticket, and not with our meals.

So, when our meals came out soon after, we breathed a sigh of relief because I was worried that my fiancé's brunch was not coming. So, we dug in, and started eating. The eggs were not over medium... they were over easy... My sirloin steaks were ordered to be medium rare, and came well done. One was actually cooked so long it was dry. I told our server, and she replied ""ok, I'll let them know"" and walked away to another table. I then stopped a manager, told him about it, and he said they could take them back and cook new ones. I said ""great! and please bring my fiancé some butter for her pancakes"".

Well, second try on the medium rare steaks came... one was well done, and the other was just over medium well. Also, the butter I had asked for was no where to be seen. So I just decided to choke them down. Not to mention, while my drink glass was empty, several people came by our table to deliver food, or to check on us, and not one asked if I'd like a refill.

Yeah, this place is an IHOP. You're not going there to expect fine dining... but if you want Sunday Brunch, they better be able to deliver it! The IHOP in Wausau, WI would run circles around these people. We went to the location in Wausau many times with not one mistake, nor any type of bad service.

There is only one good thing I can say about this dining experience -- Thank you for the excellently buttered toast!"
IHOP,bananas foster brioche french toast,"Okay, normally I don't like to give bad reviews.  Really I don't.  However, I can't let today slide.  I've been to this IHOP a few times in the past and never had an issue.  Today was different.

The young lady who waited on me was nice enough at first but it became obvious before long that she was disorganized and forgetful.  I ordered pancakes and coffee.  Did not see her again until she sat my plate of pancakes down and NO coffee.  When I mentioned the coffee, she apologized and ran off before I could get the chance to tell her she forgot the syrup too!  She had to make another trip to my table.  The manager came by; this was my opportunity to let her know I was not exactly pleased.  There was an assurance she would speak to the server.  Which is fine...but...the manager should have waited until after I left.  The server did not follow up with me during the whole time I ate.  And when the server did come back, it was only to drop off the bill and run off.  I could feel the chill in the air as she whisked herself away.

Now, what about the food?  The pancakes were dry and tasteless, and the bananas were a bit hard.  Coffee was good.

Will I go back to this IHOP?  Uncertain at this point.  As far as chain restaurants are concerned, Perkins is better.  To be honest though, I much prefer giving my money to local establishments versus national chains."

Taj Indian Restaurant,arizona green tea,"Like another reviewer said, if you are Indian, stay away from this place. I sampled just their so-called masala tea and nearly puked. I have had bad teas at many Indian restaurants but nothing comes close to being as disgusting as the stuff they sell. let me tell you why. They are  most likely using chai latte syrup. THAT IS NOT HOW YOU MAKE INDIAN MASALA TEA. How hard is it to boil ground tea leaves, add some crushed ginger-cardamom and boil with milk? Seriously! I am all the more annoyed because while driving from Chicago to the Twin Cities, I took a detour and stepped into Madison to get some good Indian chaai. and I was served this abomination. and they had already added sugar to my tea. I am guessing half a cup of sugar had been added because it tasted sickly sweet on top of being repulsive. Chaai is a staple in every Indian household and if these people cannot get that right.. or take the shortcut by pumping disgusting syrup into my cup of tea.. well.. they should not call themselves an Indian restaurant."
Taj Indian Restaurant,arizona green tea,"Yum!!!
I have never really had Indian food before and me and my man went for the lunch buffet.  It is an $8 buffet and while it is not huge, what it had was diverse (at least for me). 
I was up for trying anything, which I did and it was all good!  I loved the samosas and I dipped them in a yogurt sauce that they had available.  I tried vegetable korma which was tasty with just enough heat, and saag paneer, which was different but still good.  My favorite was probably the vegetable pakora... and of course, the naan!!!
 I also tried the desserts, which weren't my cup of tea but interesting.  They have a gelatinous dessert called gulab jamun and I found out that it is soft fried cheese balls!!! i didn't love them, but I did love this place!"
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"I've been ordering from Rosati's West since I moved to Madison. However, since they raised their prices, I don't feel like their meals are competitive anymore -- there's a lot of good other pizza joints around here. Also, their ""customer service"" is kinda crappy. Obviously, small mistakes happen - and they have multiple times before - (e.g. being charged for mayos that should have been included) but I never thought of writing a review up until tonight. 

So, amongst other things, I ordered two chicken sandwiches and cheese curds. Both came plain, with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Cheese curds also came with no sauce. I was not asked what I wanted with curds/ on sandwiches during the order and I definitely did not say that I wanted them plain, as witnessed by two other people in the room while I placed the order. When I called back, the kid told me that I ordered plain & cheese curds with no sauce. You know, if I don't explicitly say that you want lettuce, tomato and mayo, but your menu says that it comes with it, you just put in on it, period. Kid said (with an attitude) that he will put in a note for the next time... there will be no next time! It's not like I wanted my money back... all they needed to say was sorry, it's not going to happen again."
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"Rosati's gets two stars this time but it could get three or four. The potential is there and if you're going to have pizza in this strip mall, I'd choose the dark, dingy Rosati's over the more wide open, brighter Dahmen's every single time.

On our last visit, it was a Saturday around lunchtime and the place was surprisingly busy. The waitress had her hands full, but she held her own. My son and I each ordered a slice of pizza. Mine was served at room temperature. There goes one star. Make it two. The crust on their Chicago-style pizza is chewier, in an overcooked or not-very-fresh sort of way, and less flavorful than others in Chicago, and Madison for that matter. There goes another star. Make a wish. Mine is for a fresher slice of pizza. In past visits, we've had the thin crust. I think Rosati's does this much better.

My daughter had mostaccioli with sauce and butter on the side. Anyone can do that, so I'm not going to rate the entree, but I will say the marinara is fresh, thick and well-seasoned. The cheesy garlic bread is a guilty pleasure and a must-order every time, especially when dipped in that marinara. We've had the Friday fish fry. Skip it, but that's on us for ordering a fish fry at a pizza joint. 

We go to Rosati's fairly frequently and will be back. I think the solution to making this place awesome might be a just a little more attention to quality control."
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"Dined inside Rosati's for the first time on a Sunday night. I dined alone that night but craved pizza, so I opted for a calzone so I did not over-order. The mozzarella was deliciously gooey. The sausage stood out. I also ordered the calzone with fresh garlic and red onion which gave it a great balance.

My only regret about this visit is that I didn't get a deep dish pizza instead -- I get the impression that if their toppings are this great, their deep dish probably won't disappoint. Will be coming back again when I get a chance. Maybe with friends this time!"
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"Life's too short to eat mediocre pizza.  That pretty much sums up my feelings about Rosati's.  Stranded on the west side and in need of lunch, the WaunaQueen and I decided to give Rosati's a shot.  She ordered a slice of the pepperoni, I opted the Cheef sandwich, Italian Beef with covered with melted mozzarella cheese.

Both offerings were exceptionally mediocre.  The crust reminded me of what you get with a frozen pizza, dense, overly chewy and flavorless.  The sauce had that overcooked, right out of a can flavor.  The greasy cheese and pepperoni followed the exceedingly mediocre theme to a T.  To make matters worse, my wife's slice came out warm at best, so she had to have the kitchen put it in the oven to warm it up. 

The Italian Beef sandwich had little going for it in the flavor department, whether it be the spongy bread, the melted slab of chewy mozzarella cheese or the watery ju that accompanied the sandwich.  I appreciated the generous serving of beef, but man oh man, I'd trade less beef for more flavor.  The crinkle-cut fries came out warm and limp.

Service at the front counter was pleasant and efficient.  The person at the counter cheerfully greeted us as we entered the restaurant and granted our request for a side of feta cheese to go with my daughter slice of cheese pizza.  With a variety of lunch specials, you do not need to spend a fortune on your lunch here.  

The dining room could serve as a set for Goodfellas, with the Italian music wafting over the speakers, the red and white checked (plastic) tablecloths, elevated private booths and a minimal amount of sunlight filtering in though a small window.    The two big screens TVs detracted from the ambiance, but I did appreciate being able check the score of the World Cup match taking place that day.

If you are looking for cheap and filling, this is your place.  If you are looking for delicious, keep driving past this strip mall outpost."
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"I've been here before, and again, it has surpassed my expectations and has always delivered (no pun intended).  I usually only get delivery and that generally takes 45 minutes to an hour, but it's worth the wait.  This time I ordered a stuffed crust pizza - I was expecting more of a sandwich/calzone stuffed pizza, but they basically have cheese and toppings between two layers of crust and then the sauce on the top.  Still pretty delicious, but a lot like Chicago for me, which is not a bad thing. 

Also, I ordered a small batch of wings (spicy garlic) and they were delicious.  It is hard to find good wings from restaurants that don't feature them, but they did a great job!

I usually get their italian beef sandwiches, and they have always been seasoned well and you can get a small cup of au jus on the side for pretty cheap (and you don't necessarily need it).  All in all, their pizza and side items are delicious.  It's also nice to support local rather than do the national chain restaurants."
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,Wow.   Terribly disappointed.    Pizza was cold.  Sauce was tasteless.  Had veggie pizza and spinach/tomato bread.  Bland.   Will never order from here again.
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"Ordered for delivery to work today with a group of folks. I can't speak on the topic of their pizzas, but as for my portion of the order...

First, the price quoted for a personal pizza over the phone was higher than stated on the menu on the website. As well, my portion of the order was charged a separate delivery charge from the main order - though it was all delivered together. 

Second, the garlic bread was burnt, tough, and gross. Even if you were willing to handle the texture and crumbling bread, you could taste burnt garlic, not just burnt bread. We threw it away. 

Third, the personal pan pizza (cheese with pineapple). I've had better pizza at various fastfood chains that don't claim to be ""authentic Chicago pizza"". The sauce especially - yuck. As stated in other reviews, extremely greasy and messy. 

If you want good pizza in Madison, go to Ian's."
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"(First Yelp review)

First time ordering through Rosati's.  I'm tired of pizza, so I thought I'd try to mix it up a bit and get a sandwich and some sides: meatball parm, garlic wings, and cheese fries.

The delivery went OK, no complaints there.  The delivery charge was reasonable (about half that of most folks on Grubhub) and the timing was decent.  The food, however was an absolute travesty.

- SO MUCH SALT.  I was unable to finish a single dish because everything was drenched in salt.  The bread, the cheese, the meatballs.... all one big briny mess.  

- The cheese on the sandwich was felt plasticky and tasteless.  I'm pretty sure the cheese on the cheese fries came out of a can.  Maybe I expected too much from a restaurant in Wisconsin (I didn't realize Rosati's was a chain.  I was thinking more along the lines of AJ's in Verona), but I always expect the cheese to be good, at least.

- The garlic bread was hard instead of crispy, salty instead of garlicky.

- The one positive was that that the Diet Coke was cold.

So, in the future... no.  Maybe I just got a bad sample, but it was bad enough that I'm not going to give it another shot."
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,"Being a recovering former Flatlander I was well familiar with Rosati's before I moved to Madison. Having gone to several of them around Chicago I've found there to be a lot of variation from individual restaurant in the chain. I just wanted to make that clear so I identified that it was this specific Rosati's I was talking about.

Anyhow! I've ordered pizza from them a half a dozen times in a couple of years and have dined in once. They are my Go-To for ""as-near-to-real-Chicago-style-as-I-can-get"" pizza in Madison and they do it well. The crust is perfectly crisped, the cheese thick as it should be, and the toppings generous. They have a well seasoned sausage that I just love. I will note that when I order from them I *do* ask for less sauce on top as they have occasionally gone wild with it (and sauce gone wild just is nothing anyone should have to deal with).

Anyhow -- I've had other things from them as well and I have to say their pasta has not wowed me but it is pretty good. Their biggest weakness seems to be their sauce; It just needs more flavor or at least a stronger flavor. 

For the bread lover you'll want to hit up the Nuggets but don't do it alone. If you think these are a side order for one person you will find yourself awash in a tide of deliciously fried, lightly sauced goodness that your heart may not recover from. 

The service when I had dined in was good; I didn't go long without a refill and they checked in often enough that we knew they were watching but not so often that it was obnoxious. There was a little delay before we ordered but that can happen when it gets busy so I am not about to begrudge them that.

Their Chicago-style really is the closest to downtown Chicago I've had since I've been up here and that alone will keep me coming back indefinitely... or at least until Gino's or Giordano's crawl their way up I-90."
Rosati's Pizza,spinach and tomato garlic bread,Good food. Good service. I like spicy Italian beef on garlic bread and their stuffed pizza (buttery crust). 4 stars.
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"The pork chow mein consisted of an ample mess of overcooked bok choy, maybe some onions (I'm not sure that's what they were), and roast pork. The pork was juicy with the sauce (which had a decent flavor, the sauce, that is), but the pork had an odd flavor that I recognized as meat that's been previously frozen and maybe a little freezer burnt. The fried noodles were the thick kind (not the slender round kind) and were stale enough that I could not eat them. The dish came with a side of particularly flavorless fried rice that had (also previously frozen) peas and carrots in it. 

I also got a side of crab rangoons. They were thin, but greasy and creamy and tasty. And the plum sauce reminded me of the plum sauce I had as a kid when my parents ordered carryout - glowing and orange and sweetly delicious.

The rangoons didn't redeem the meal.  The quality of the ingredients in the chow mein was unacceptable.  I don't care how inexpensive the food is, it's not worth it if it isn't edible."
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"Food wasn't bad, but the portion sizes were off (for delivery, at least). My entrée was basic sesame chicken, with a side of rice. The chicken and rice came together, meaning that the bottom 3/4 of my container was rice while the surface layer was chicken. I finished the chicken in what seemed like a moment. Obviously an attempt to save money on their part, but not what I'm looking for."
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"You can't beat this.

one pork egg roll or order of crab rangoon

I had hunan chicken which featured large pieces of white meat chicken, no gristle, lots of seemingly fresh veggies (broccoli, peppers, onion, etc.), and a nicely spiced and not too sweet sauce. The fried rice was yellow and nothing spectacular. It's a great deal for takeout. The small filled me up (and I have a big appetite for Chinese takeout!)
I haven't experienced any customer service problems, but while I was there waiting for my food, there were two other guys waiting. One had ordered a small special with general tso's and one had ordered a large general tso's. They called out ""one kung pao chicken"" and it seemed like it could have turned into a big debacle, but the guys who wanted general tso's corrected them and the guys behind the counter promptly brought them their correct orders. 
I did appreciate the health department's ""symptoms of norovirus"" flier posted on the soda refrigerator..."
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"Cheap, but bad. The store itself looks really second rate and the rice I got was dry and aged. The chicken was dry and the sauce looked really artificially colored. Very cheap lunch though if you don't mind eating a little worse"
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"For the price it's pretty good, and the vegetables are fresh seeming which is more than I can say for most Chinese places. I got a $7 meal with crab Rangoon, fried rice, general tsoas chicken and a fortune cookie, good deal"
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"A8 China is like the lowest on the totem pole when it comes to Chinese Food. The fried rice wasn't even fried, I mean WTF? That's SO false advertising! The food wasn't even good!! STAY AWAY!"
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,questionably low quality chinese food. lo mein had an off smell and tasted off as well. went in the trash unfortunately. General tso and fried rice was somewhat edible for a few bites but not worth it in my opinion. I think this is one of the cheapest chinese places in town so you get what you pay for I guess.
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one."
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"A8 China is located near my building and I've gone there several times for carry out. The first visit went relatively well - I ordered my food, waited for roughly 10 minutes and was served quite an average plate of General Tso's Chicken. The chicken was lacking in flavor and texturally unimpressive but my egg roll and fried rice were decent.

NOW, a few months pass and I decide to return on a lazy sunday evening, and I experience some of the worst service and food of my time in Madison. The restaurant was not ridiculously busy and seemed well-staffed for a Sunday night, but it took 25 minutes for my one serving of Lo Mein to arrive. During the waiting period, I asked the cashier when I should expect it and she looked confused and seemed to shout back to the cook, correcting the original order. Not good! Although she repeated my order back to me at checkout, I figured that they probably started making something else and had to restart. Worse things have happened, and I figured, if the food was good, I'd be alright with it. On a side note, another bad sign was the lady in the store who was waiting to return a full bag of food she'd ordered earlier!

Anyways, my food finally came and, upon returning home, I encountered a horrendously bland, over-oiled Lo Mein with dry, flaky fried rice. The only redeeming feature of the dish was the crab rangoon, which was pleasantly sweet and tasty!

Needless to say, I will not be returning to A8 China anytime soon due to my experience with both poor service and food. For better Chinese in Madison, I'd recommend Asian Kitchen or QQ. I don't mind walking a bit further for an equally priced Chinese dish that's infinitely better than what A8 serves!"
A8 China,28. roast pork fried rice,"Lousy, worthless Chinese food easily outdone by any other restaurant in the area. Their prices aren't any lower, and their food is noticeably worse. Fuck you A8 China. Why are you still open? 

Some time ago I ordered the pepper steak and onion, knowing full well that they were going to overload the dish with peppers in order to minimize the amount of meat they had to give me. This disregard for their customers should have been the first sign that I was making a big mistake eating here instead of just going down the street to Asian Kitchen or calling up Jade Garden for a delivery. At least as AK, they overload one order with more food than you could comprehend eating in two sittings.

Thinking myself to be quite clever, I asked A8 to omit the peppers and put extra meat instead. Their response? Give me more onions than I ever thought fucking possible. I swear could smell my order down the block. I opened the box to find a massive pile of milky clear, floppy, disgustingly overcooked onions covered in ground pepper, overflowing its way into my rice and looking similar to and about as appetizing as a pile of maggots. Buried underneath were literally - and I shit you not - FOUR pieces of meat. Unsurprisingly, they tasted like peppery rubber and after 3 seconds of chewing, turned into an ball of lard-flavored chewing gum.

Rice was undercooked, eggroll was soggy and tasted microwaved, like the shit you buy at Sam's Club. Don't eat here. Ever."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"As far as Chinese food goes, this is the best in Madison, which is why it gets 5 stars.  The only other comparable location is Ichiban Szechuan, and that restaurant is more oily and less flavorful.

The style here is mostly from southern China--most dishes are spicy, and there are very few vegetarian options (though the vegetarian options are delicious as well).

One thing to note is that their 'hotpot' dishes aren't what you'd expect of 'huo guo'.  These are mostly dry dishes kept heated over a flame.  Worth a try if you're curious.

They have 'Americanized' menu items which tend to be a little too sweet.  I would recommend getting anything with a Chinese name next to it. 

Items I usually get:
Mapo Tofu
Spicy twice cooked fish
Cumin lamb
Hot and sour soup

The service is usually fast, but can be slow on busier days."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"Okay food, TERRIBLE service. Had to order my soup and appetizer twice, after they didn't bring it the first time. Took them 40 minutes just to come around to take our order (it was not full). They walked past the table a handful of times, making eye contact, but failing to ask if we needed anything. Got my water filled once, after I had to interrupt a gossip session between the employees. Overall, decent food and good portions, but would never go there again. The waitress had no personality at all. Way too expensive for what we really got."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"Yum.  In town visiting a friend and came here by chance, I ordered the pan fried noodles (asked for them to be spicy!) and my friend ordered the kung pao chicken. We both loved our food, and my friend has decided to definitely come here more often now! FYI that the pop comes in cans."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"My first time here. The space is rather barren and visually unappealing. I started by ordering one of their interesting-looking sake varieties by the glass, only to find out they are now served by the bottle only (at $20 and up). I went with the Ozeki, and the server didn't bother to unscrew the cap for me. I ordered wonton soup and the seafood and eggplant hotpot.  The soup broth was hot and savory, and the wontons meaty. The ""hotpot"" was served before I was halfway done with soup. It was more like a tureen, and the food color matched Fugu's interior - yellowish green and brown. A large portion of eggplant and not so much seafood, just a few small shrimp, scallops, calamari and krabmeat, served with basic rice. The sauce was fine but calamari was tough. I imagine they focus more on carryouts judging by the disinterested wait staff and constantly ringing phone. I won't be back."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"Pretty decent place, especially for college students. Great for large groups and people who are not that picky about Asian food. We usually come here with a group of around 10 people and have never had trouble getting a table. I like the mapo tofu and some of the meat dishes. We also had a soup, but for next time, I would stick with the mapo tofu, meats, and eggplants. I think if I had ordered more ""orange chicken"" type of dishes, I would be less satisfied."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"I first tried this place after some friends brought some leftovers. Of course, that isn't necessarily an ideal first experience but the beef tripe and ox tongue was fantastic, so I had to check this place out. My husband and I went after work on a Friday night, so it was busy. The server took a bit to actually come by and acknowledge us, but considering how busy it was, I try to be understanding. Right away I ordered the beef tripe and ox tongue as well as the spicy fried intestines. My husband ordered twice cooked spicy pork. The beef tripe and ox tongue is really interesting to me because first and foremost, it's the first time I've had tripe in a dish other than menudo. My husband was really put off by the fact that it  was not served hot, but still liked the flavor. I believe it was supposed to be served that way, at least from what I remember my friends telling me. The best part of the meal was the spicy fried intestines, hands down. I've had beef intestines before (tacos de tripa con cilantro y cebolla, yum), but these were pork so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were AMAZING. Served up sliced in a big pile with a lot of red chilies, they had a nice crisp on the outside and the inside was soft and juicy. The flavor was different from beef intestine, similar but a little bit like tripe. I don't really know how to describe it. Oh my god, it has to be the best thing I've had in a while. EAT THEM. NOW."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"The location of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being located on State St right on campus, it's definitely popular amongst students especially. They serve good Sze Chuan food, which means that the majority of the dishes will be cooked with spicy oil -- making them spicy. 

Their menu actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I order and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus, there are many reviews of Fugu out here with good recommendations on what to get, so I will talk more about the experience and service here. 

Went to lunch once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the lunch specials, which was a good deal coming to about $10. It has a set consisting of the main course, a soup and fruits to go with it. Most of their sets are served in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For dinner you just order off their menu.

Service wise, it's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your main course dishes might come before or together with your appetizers. On some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your order. But they are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. 

I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting area and ample parking. Between one or the other it all boils down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan dishes =)"
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"I've never given a restaurant one star before. I would actually give it a quarter star but my son did like his tom yum soup broth.   Note, broth only. 

Sunday dinner, which is usually nice. Decided to try someplace new for Chinese food, as Madtown has so few good choices and we had not had any in a while.

We had four dishes and soup. All were pretty bad. 

Crab Rangoon - soft wontons through, very little filling, greasy on bottom. Served with so little sauce it was very noticeable. 

Five flavor beef - so full of gristle it was almost inedible. We picked around gristle to at least give it a chance. Flavor was just ok, green inion on plate was slimy. 

Cold chicken in chili sauce. Looked thrown together. Smothered in chili oil. Slimy mess, although the chicken seemed fresh as I was lucky and got a pin feather in mine. (Note - I don't want to know if it was NOT a pin feather.)

Pork with mustard noodles. Pork was very gamey in an unpleasant way. Bland otherwise. Gelatinous.  Noodles were slimy and way over cooked.  

My hot and sour soup was a greasy gelatinous mess. 

I hate to say it, but the common adjectives of most of the dishes were ""greasy"", ""slimy"", over-oily, or ""gelatinous"", nine if which were in a good way. 

Will avoid this place. Recommend you do too. 

Sad, as we really hoped for a good Chinese place. 

Oops - almost forgot - and the prices were high end for Chinese food, in an environment that was also greasy. Ah well."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"Since I'm sitting here waiting on the waiter who has taken forever and who barely spoke any English, I'll write a review. Basically the server avoided almost all communication with me including a greeting because he spoke maybe four words of English. My soup took forever to come out, then my entree showed up right after....COLD! I asked them to heat it up in the microwave because I didn't have time to wait on it to be made again. I'm writing this review because it's my 2nd night in a row having a pretty bad experience at a restaurant in Madison. Over it."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"Hands down my favorite Asian restaurant in Madison:

Let me start by saying that I am not of Chinese decent, nor have I ever traveled to China,  but I have a feeling that this is what authentic Chinese cuisine tastes like. Every time I walk in there, the place is PACKED with people chatting in Mandarin over big family-style dishes. Furthermore, it is SO SO SO much better than any ""Americanized"" Chinese food I've ever had. 

My favorite part about this place is definitely the sichuan pepper dishes. They are an extremely difficult ingredient to get your hands on if you don't have access to an Asian foods market, but they're absolutely delicious (and spicy to boot)! Favorites of mine include sichuan cucumber salad and sichuan eggplant, but the pickled pepper dishes look fabulous as well! Everything on the ""regular"" (not ""American-Style"") menu here that is advertised as ""spicy"" is ACTUALLY spicy, which I love! The food is bursting with flavor and these dishes make it easy to understand why Chinese fare is typically served with WHITE (not fried) rice: the rice soaks up all of the delicious juices and becomes one of the most flavorful components of the meal.

Speaking of rice, the rice here is PHENOMENAL and is cooked to perfection (both white and fried). For all of you naysayers out there who think that rice can't be done ""wrong,"" you're mistaken. Fried rice lovers, take one bite of the fried rice at FUGU and you will understand that every other Chinese place you've ever been to has cooked their rice to a lower standard. Here, it is soft, fluffy, flavorful, and just slightly sticky. YUM. It's the best fried rice I've ever had. 

Like most Asian restaurants, the selection is huge and there are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options (vegan PRO TIP: try the garlic eggplant--out of this world! Just make sure to spread the spicy oils over your rice). I have yet to venture out and try some of the REALLY authentic dishes (tripe, ox tongue, etc), but some of the borderline-authentic stuff has come up short for me (in particular, the pork dumplings with chili oil--I couldn't stomach them). I've also gone in the opposite direction: the ""American Style"" menu is expansive, but FUGU does NOT do American Chinese food well (shame on them for being TOO authentic--lol). There is a consistent lack of spice and flavor with every dish I've tried on that menu (although the quality of products is still supreme). I think it best to stick with the ""middle ground"" of the menu here. 

Overall, give FUGU a shot, and you won't be disappointed (at least not for carry out; I've never dined in)."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"So I'm in town on a business trip and sick as a dog. I decided that only some Asian cuisine would do. I ordered fairly simple fare -- Wonton Soup with Garlic Pork Spareribs. The soup was bland with a greasy consistently. The two wontons had a strange texture.. Almost like they'd been boiling for hours. The flavor and texture was unpleasant. Then the Garlic Spareribs were breaded and we're not boneless. I figured this out when I made the mistake of biting into one. It would've been ok if it at least tasted good, but no.  I was really disappointed by the meal. Promising menu, but the food doesn't deliver."
Fugu,37. tom yum soup,"Somehow I have lived a block and a half away from Fugu for three years and never tried it.  Something about the exterior (one prominent sign advising ""No Public Restrooms"" and two more warning of hidden cameras in operation) just turned me off.  That all changed yesterday when my wife and I finally gave it a try.  Oh my God-- absolutely delicious!  I'll get the bad out of the way first-- the restaurant was fairly crowded for 4:00 in the afternoon and only one waiter was working-- there were a lot of tables that hadn't been cleared and we waited about 10 minutes to be seated.  One of our water glasses was also less than clean.  But I don't even care because the food was A-MA-ZING.  I've been craving a decent hot and sour soup ever since I moved to Madison and they delivered.  The chicken with garlic sauce was perfect.  The waiter (who was extremely nice) warned me about how spicy the fried beef in chili sauce would be and he was right.  It was also delicious.   We've eaten there two days in a row now and will definitely be back.

Edit: I'm downgrading this to four stars.  I've been back a number of times (mostly for takeout) and I'll definitely be going back, but it hasn't worked out to be a five-star performance.  

Two main problems: 1) Consistency: Some things are really, really good and a great value.  Some things are less good (mongolian beef was tough, hunan beef didn't have much beef).  Some things that are often good are sometimes not good (hot and sour soup).  2) Service: Everyone is very nice, but the place just doesn't run well.  They need someone coordinating everything, because the service is slow and out of joint."
Fugu,31. tomato and egg soup,"As far as Chinese food goes, this is the best in Madison, which is why it gets 5 stars.  The only other comparable location is Ichiban Szechuan, and that restaurant is more oily and less flavorful.

The style here is mostly from southern China--most dishes are spicy, and there are very few vegetarian options (though the vegetarian options are delicious as well).

One thing to note is that their 'hotpot' dishes aren't what you'd expect of 'huo guo'.  These are mostly dry dishes kept heated over a flame.  Worth a try if you're curious.

They have 'Americanized' menu items which tend to be a little too sweet.  I would recommend getting anything with a Chinese name next to it. 

Items I usually get:
Mapo Tofu
Spicy twice cooked fish
Cumin lamb
Hot and sour soup

OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,salt lassi,"This was very good, authentic Indian food, especially for the price. I went here because many coworkers were recommending it, and it had good reviews online. The service was great - upon walking through the front door, the hostess welcomed us and immediately offered lassi or chai tea. 

The atmosphere was also good, both modern and cozy with a fireplace, a few lounge chairs, regular table seating, and comfy booths.The kitchen was also easily visible from the dining area, so you can see your food prepared as you wait. 

The best part was the food - very yummy. I tried the lassi, which tasted just like I remembered as a kid, along with a creamy paneer dish. 

On a side note, I also noticed a cute corner play area for children, which was pretty thoughtful. I would definitely recommend this place."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,salt lassi,"We decided to check out Om Indian Fusion Cuisine last minute and it turned out to be a good decision. The variety of dishes they have are amazing - they have different dishes from all parts of India which great especially if everyone wants to try something different. We ordered a few different dishes: Chicken tikka, Kashmiri Palao, and onion rava dosa. The chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly. The Kashmiri Palao was something we had never had. It was more on the sweet side which I usually don't like for a main dish but still very tasty. The rava dosa was really delicious and very aromatic from the minute the dish was on our table. 
We also tried some of the drinks. We tried the sweet, salty, and mango lassi. The salty lassi was a bit too salty for my taste. The sweet lassi according to my mom tasted like it was homemade. The best was the mango lassi. Our server did tell us the Lassis are made from scratch. 
The service was great, and overall it was a great experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try Indian food. Definitely will be back again!"
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,sweet lassi,"This was very good, authentic Indian food, especially for the price. I went here because many coworkers were recommending it, and it had good reviews online. The service was great - upon walking through the front door, the hostess welcomed us and immediately offered lassi or chai tea. 

The atmosphere was also good, both modern and cozy with a fireplace, a few lounge chairs, regular table seating, and comfy booths.The kitchen was also easily visible from the dining area, so you can see your food prepared as you wait. 

The best part was the food - very yummy. I tried the lassi, which tasted just like I remembered as a kid, along with a creamy paneer dish. 

On a side note, I also noticed a cute corner play area for children, which was pretty thoughtful. I would definitely recommend this place."
OM Indian Fusion Cuisine,sweet lassi,"We decided to check out Om Indian Fusion Cuisine last minute and it turned out to be a good decision. The variety of dishes they have are amazing - they have different dishes from all parts of India which great especially if everyone wants to try something different. We ordered a few different dishes: Chicken tikka, Kashmiri Palao, and onion rava dosa. The chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly. The Kashmiri Palao was something we had never had. It was more on the sweet side which I usually don't like for a main dish but still very tasty. The rava dosa was really delicious and very aromatic from the minute the dish was on our table.

Overall the restaurant is marginally nasty from a cleanliness perspective... we've sent back greens because they had dirt on them, sent back glasses because they had lipstick on them... but the hot pot is consistently great.  Note that all the hot pots come with a bunch of greens and other sides... so if you go nuts and get a bunch of extras, realize that you've already got a lot of extras coming (last time we went I tried to get an idea from the waitress what all came on the side, but the language barrier left me clueless after her response-- but otherwise service was friendly and responsive).

Also (and this is not clear) - you can get regular broth, spicy broth, or half- and half where where the pot itself has a divider down the middle....

We paid $12 something before tip, very reasonable for the amount and quality of food. The vegetable selection that came with it was good, also included some fish and pork balls. I had mostly spicy, and added some chili paste. When I had the noodles at the end I had to add a little regular to cool it off, but it was an enjoyable spicy flavor.

We got the spicy broth and it was perfect. The chicken was a bit dry, but that's probably because we failed and over cooked it. They also had these pork dumpling things that were amazing.

Soga Shabu Shabu,2. farm-style fried pork bento box,"In my few visits to Soga, I've had tasty experiences. A tad pricey experiences, but tasty ones.

My first meal here was with a big group and we settled on hot pot. We'd hosted our own little hot pot party a month or so prior, so I will say that the bar had been set high. A pot of boiling broth arrives to your table along with a bounty of raw veggies and thinly shaved raw meats. Chicken and pork were the selections we made for the night. The concept is fondue-esque, yet you're cooking your meat in broth rather than oil. We found the broth to be dull in flavor and the meat portions to be skimpy. The dipping sauces for after you cook the food also left much to be desired. Thus, while the hot pot at Soga was adequate, we weren't overly impressed. 

I will say that each entree I've ordered since has been great. 

The wings are perhaps my favorite option here. They're served rather spicy and with sauteed veggies and chopped peanuts. I've then tried the gyoza dumplings as an appetizer, as well as the dry braised chicken in hot pot. No complaints with the dumplings and holy spice on that chicken, in a good way. 

I also ordered delivery once and opted for the ribs stewed with pumpkin, which was impressively portioned and speedily delivered.

While Soga is on the pricier side in terms of Asian food in town, I've found the good food and hearty portions to be worth the extra expense."

Ichiban Sichuan,sauteed cow stomach,"Because this place had a 4 star rating we decided to try it for dinner.  We ordered chicken feet as appetizers, dry sauteed green beans, kung pao chicken and a seafood dish.

The worst dinner EVER!.  The chicken feet were pickled, rubbery and not spicy at all.
The other dishes were so salt laden my wife spat hers out and I gagged on my first bite. The kung pao sauce, aside from being way too salty, had no other flavour and was watery.

We complained to the manager who said there must have been ""a little too much salt"". Try there must have been half a container used for it to be this over-salted.

I don;t know if they were trying to give us the heave ho but as there was only one table there and they were friends of the manager I am assuming they were not inclined to new customers.

Don't bother trying this place, nothing authentic here."
Ichiban Sichuan,sauteed cow stomach,"The Chinese food there is authentic to me a native Chinese, however there are some downside that just balance the good part out. 

1. The service is bad. Water didn't get refilled. The rice came long after the entree. 
2. I find the chicken pork there are in normal quality, but not the beef! I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup on the other day. The beef cubes were very hard to chew, seem to come from the bone junctions or who-knows-where parts of a cow (hoofs or intestines?). It tasted like the elastic band. I could even see the white artery tubes sticking out of the meat. Yak."
Ichiban Sichuan,sauteed cow stomach,"Ive gotten take out from here quite a few times. This is the most authentic Chinese food I've had in Madison so far. They offer Americanized food too like sesame chicken, but I'm a fan of the spicy crispy chicken and the pig stomach in chili sauce.

Do you like bacon? Try twice cooked pork"
Ichiban Sichuan,sauteed cow stomach,"So I came to Madison hoping against hope that there would be a Chinese restaurant I could at least stomach. (Coming from a Chinese family, after living in California and visiting Taiwan every year... you get the picture.)
 
Imagine my surprise when the first Chinese place I go to is GREAT! My mom and I were both impressed. We had a great time talking to the two male waiters, who are both from the same hometown in China as my mom. Be prepared for the food to be spicy, but if you like that- this is the place for you.

Here's what I have tried so far, and every single one I fully endorse:
-Sichuan Style Cucumber Appetizer
-Spicy Stir Fried Green Beans
-Twice Cooked Pork with Black Curded Bean and Pepper
-Chicken with Three Pepper
-Sliced Fish with Salted Mustard Cabbage (it's a soup, don't be surprised, but IT'S SO GOOD. really spicy though.)

But everything is worth a try! Packed on weekend nights (with Chinese!), but the place is big so no worries."
Ichiban Sichuan,sauteed cow stomach,"I was a little skeptical as I drove up to Ichiban Sichuan because when I looked into the window I didn't see anyone inside. As I walked into the restaurant (because I trust Yelper's reviews), the other half of the restaurant was packed. 

We were promptly seated and given glasses of water along with a set of menus. After going over the vast menu, we decided on a mapo tofu, spicy dried intestines, and spicy fish hotpot with mushrooms. 

All three dishes were out on the table within 10 minutes. I've never been to a restaurant where the food is served piping hot in a matter of minutes. All three dishes were delicious. The food wasn't too spicy, but it had a great flavor. The mapo tofu was served piping hot with tons of meat and spicy sauce. The fish hot pot was not too spicy but had a nice kick to it. There was plenty of fish along with a good portion of enoki mushrooms and bean sprouts. The dried intestines was a little disappointing. The flavor was good, but it wasn't as crispy as I expected. Overall the flavor of the food was excellent, but on the greasy side. So, if you don't have a iron stomach, you might want to only get one spicy dish. 

I definitely will be back one more time before I leave Madison. Thanks again Ichiban Sichuan for the delicious meal!!!"
Yola's Cafe,kid's sausage and egg,"I visited Yola's Café for the first time and experienced the equivalent of death by a thousand paper cuts.  While I liked Yola's family-friendly coffeehouse concept, a series of service missteps and lackluster execution of the food order made for a less than stellar experience.

While waiting for my wife to arrive, my daughter and I hungrily spied the butterscotch and chocolate chip scone in the display case on the front counter.  We recently basked in the glory that is the oatmeal butterscotch cookie from Batch Bakehouse and hoped Yola's would provide us with a west-side fix for our new butterscotch addiction.  Alas, it was not to be.  The scone was overly dry and lacked the richness of the scones from the aforementioned Batch.  

When my wife arrived, there were a steady stream of customers pouring into the café.  After a short wait, a rather stoic gentleman took our order.  He did not greet us, hardly smiled and did not offer any recommendations as we made our picks from the menu.  Frankly, it was a little awkward.  I did score the free 16 oz. coffee offered with a Yelp check-in (thank you, Yelp!).  When we finished ordering, my wife and daughter each asked for a cup of water, which also drew a blank expression from our stoic friend.

We took our number and trudged off to a table, which the party at the neighboring table was using to discard their dirty dishes.  All the unoccupied tables had dirty dishes and were in desperate need of a good wipe down.

After a short wait, stoic dude arrived with my daughter's fruit cup.  At the counter, stoic dude told us the fruit cup contained strawberries, blueberries and pineapple.  What we received was a cup full of cantaloupe and honeydew (which my daughter is not a fan of).  To their credit, when I pointed this out, stoic dude took it back and we later received a large cup brimming with ripe strawberries, pineapple and grapes.

After another short wait, my wife and I received our sandwiches.  However, my daughter and I did not receive our drinks and nor did we receive our water.  So I trudged back to the counter, only to see a long line of customers waiting to order.  While waiting in line, I noticed a water cooler that stoic dude failed to mention when we ordered our food.  So I filled a couple of cups with water and trudged back to the table.  Still no beverage order.  So I trudge back to the counter to check on the status of the drinks.  Still a long line, so I wait...and wait...and wait.  Finally, I get to the front of the line.  I ask stoic dude about my coffee.  He instructs me to grab a coffee cup from behind the coffee carafes.  C'mon stoic dude, you could have mentioned that when we ordered.  So I grab a cup with high hopes that my beverage odyssey was about to end.   Curses, foiled again, the carafe is empty.  After a short wait, the owner finally indicates they are brewing more coffee.  So I trudge back to the table and take a bite of my now cool egg sandwich.  Then the owner indicates the carafe has been filled.  So you guessed it, I trudge up to the counter and fill my mug.  I inquire about my daughter's beverage.  The owner indicates he is working on it.  A minute later, stoic dude delivers the caramel apple drink.  It is lukewarm and tasted like Juicy Juice apple juice with a faint hint of caramel.

For what it's worth, the robust Yola's dark roast is one fine cup of coffee.

I finally start eating the rest of my now cold egg sandwich.  While I like the concept of serving the sandwich on a ciabatta roll, the crust was too soft and did not offer much flavor.  The sandwich was small, slightly larger than an English muffin.  The smoked bacon was paper-thin and did not provide much flavor or texture.  The egg was under-seasoned and by the time I finally ate my sandwich, the greens were warm and mushy.  In retrospect, I should have asked to have the sandwich replaced after my long beverage ordeal.

Other observations:
* The wi-fi signal at Yola's is excellent.
* The tables are densely packed, making the constant journeys to the front counter an inconvenience for you and your neighbors. 
* On the table, there was a list of interesting beverage specials, including a salted caramel chai (yum).  The problem: I didn't see the list until after I made my order.  They really need to post this list by the front counter in a more conspicuous manner.

So, would I go back - maybe, but definitely not at peak service hours.  I do love a good malted waffle, the signature dish of Yola's.  However, if I see stoic dude behind the counter, I am making a beeline for the exit."
Yola's Cafe,kid's sausage and egg,"Who could say no to a freshly made Belgian waffle, made from a family restaurant with a secret ingredient, all topped up with strawberries and whipped cream? Not many. This is the featured item on Yola's breakfast menu, along with a few egg dishes, oatmeal, yogurt and bakery.  The lunch menu offers a pretty standard selection of soups and salads, and the drink menu is cafe-standard as well. On my last visit I ordered a smoothie, which was ok but topped with completely deflated whipped cream. :(

The atmosphere is comfortable and seems to attract a varied crowd. There is free wireless and plenty of outlets, also some great patio seating. I must say I particularly enjoyed the cafe's selection of music. Yola's is relatively new (it replaced the west end location of Crema Cafe a few months ago) and still putting itself together, so for now I'll say this place is only A-OK, but offers a lot of potential to become something much more than that. Only time and waffle cravings will tell..."
Yola's Cafe,kid's sausage and egg,"I visited Yola's Cafe for the first time today with a friend of mine and her two young sons. I loved the vibe of the cafe. They have three sections to sit in with a variety of tables and comfy chairs. The center section has a fireplace which I can imagine being very nice on cooler days! 

There was a variety of customers, including business people, young adults, and people with children. The cafe is very family-friendly. We sat at a nice table right by a small play area for the children. I like how the play area is in a corner and provides kids with kitchen-play options, puzzles, books, games, and chalkboards. My friend's sons had a great time and loved the food! 

There is a good selection of food and drinks. The food comes out fresh and warm! My friend ordered a waffle topped with strawberries, blueberries, and whipped cream. She and her boys enjoyed it and it was a good amount for the price. I had a breakfast sandwich. It comes on a bagel or english muffin with either sausage, ham, or bacon, along with eggs and cheese. It was delicious! When I go back, I'd like to get a homemade smoothie and one of their lunch sandwiches. 

The wall art seemed a little random, but I realized that all of the pieces were designed by the same artist, which I thought was neat. They also had cards, jewelry, and other little things made by local designers for purchase. 

Such a nice place! I will definitely be going back."
Yola's Cafe,kid's sausage and egg,"I eat here a lot! I love the waffles, organic eggs, oatmeal and bacon! I only wish that the egg prep would be more consistent among the different cooks -- over easy is not the same as over medium or harder... sweet little gem of a place and great bang for the buck!"
Yola's Cafe,kid's sausage and egg,"Cute little spot to grab a breakfast sandwich! Good customer service (but it can take a while at times.) The signature breakfast sandwich is large and delicious. It has herbed cream cheese, fried egg, greens, and bacon. I was excited to see that the fruit cup was very fresh and had raspberries and strawberries (which is much better from my perspective than pineapple and melon.) The location is a little hidden- you wouldn't really expect a cafe to be near all of the other shopping. The coffee is very delicious as well, strong but still drinkable.

Wifi, comfy seating, and a play area for children make this a good breakfast spot on the West side."
Yola's Cafe,kid's sausage and egg,"My new favorite breakfast sandwich!  It's worth getting out of bed for on a Saturday morning. Steaming hot fried egg, a melty cheddar-herb cream cheese with a kick of garlic, and crisp greens on a super fresh, tender ciabatta. 

What sets this sandwich apart from the rest is the high quality of ingredients, the freshness of the bread, and the distinctive and flavorful cream cheese.

I'll be back to try more at yola's."
Crostini Sandwiches,dasani bottled water,Wow so disappointed. I just picked up a bowl of their homemade chicken noodle soup which is just a big bowl of noodles in water with a couple of dry pieces of chicken and a couple of chunks of vegetables no flavor very very disappointed... I would have just opened a can of soup at home if I would have known!
Crostini Sandwiches,san pellegrino sparkling water,Wow so disappointed. I just picked up a bowl of their homemade chicken noodle soup which is just a big bowl of noodles in water with a couple of dry pieces of chicken and a couple of chunks of vegetables no flavor very very disappointed... I would have just opened a can of soup at home if I would have known!
Crostini Sandwiches,san pellegrino sparkling water,"Delicious- The service is great, the food is fantastic and they heve GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS! The Italian Beef rocks, and the turkey/ cranberry panini is also great. They serve San Pellegrino and other upmarket bevvies,, and then there's the free cookie.... Eaten here about a half dozen times. Try it, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
Chang Jiang,cold sesame noodles,"I love this place! Its super easy to get to. The food is great. Basically you can get all your staple takeout foods at a decent price with pretty large portions. I love their noodles and the terryaki sticks..... mmmmm. I would recommend if you need a quick chinese food fix at a great price! Note: this is not a sit down place. Simply takeout. You can sit at their very few seating areas, but they focus on takeout, which is speedy service I might add!"
Chang Jiang,cold sesame noodles,"Pleasantly surprised.
One of the only places in town that offer cold sesame noodles.
Their 'House Special' soup was impressive; similar to a 'sizzling rice soup' without the rice.
High quality take out containers; easy to wash and re-use.
Asked for crispy vegetables in two dishes; both were perfect.
Only downside: Hot and Sour soup was bland.
Definitely order again."
Happy Wok,4 piece crab rangoon,"Happy wok has wonderful food! Their steamed dumplings are great, all hand made! We've also had crab rangoon, beef and broccoli, general tsos, and chicken lo mein! Everything has been great! Small family place, quick and friendly customer service!"
Happy Wok,4 piece crab rangoon,Happy wok is great! The delivery person was fast and personable. The crab Rangoon is spot on. Egg rolls have some weird random meat Inside-wouldn't recommend. We tried the Happy Family which has delicious flavorful mushrooms. Crispy chicken is also flavorful. The portions are perfect size especially for the price. Definitely recommend for a comfy night in!
Happy Wok,4 piece crab rangoon,"I wish I could give this place no stars.  The food was enedible.  First, all of our food was the same ugly color brown.  Second, the General Tso's chicken was waaaaay too spicy.  My husband who loves spicy food couldn't even eat it.  The Sesame chicken was so sour that no one wanted to eat it.  The lo mein had no taste.  The fried rice was so dry i had to take a drink mid chew to be able to get it down my throat. The crab rangoon was so greasy that it left a coating in our mouths. It was all a waste since we just threw it out and ordered a pizza.  never again."
Burrito Drive,black beans,"I was hungry, it was filling and I ate it.  Built my own tacos, chose the pork, also added beans & guacamole.  Overall flavorless, some spice but the cheese was barely melted and I've made better guacamole with avocado & salsa than what was on there.  Small selection compared to a real Mexican place, no taquitos or chile relleno, or even a boring old taco salad.  Pickled onions reminded me of the south if the border plate at the Weary.  Overall I'm not impressed and for the prices, won't order again unless someone else pays."
Burrito Drive,black beans,"It's a really good place. They have amazing, innovative ideas like ""white trash"" burritos and whatnot. It sortof reminds me of Ian's pizza but..for Mexican food. They offer pretty decent delivery(a little slow but you get it). I really recommend their cheese enchiladas..as far as those go - really good. I'm not as much of a fan of their sides(rice&beans) as I've been at other places and the prices are fair."
Burrito Drive,black beans,"We really like Burrito Drive.  The fact that they are willing to deliver late at night is also a plus. I had the house Chimichanga.  It was absolutely delicious. It was so filling I could only eat half of it and saved the other half for lunch the next day.  My hubby had the tacos.  He said they were really good.  The downside was that all 3 tacos had to be the same meat selection.  it would be nice if he could have tried out 3 different tacos.  The rice and beans were just okay.  A little bland and dry.  Overall, for the price, convenience, customer service and short amount of time it took to get our food, this place is pretty good.  I have ordered from here several times and I will be ordering again!"
Burrito Drive,black beans,"I really want to like this place. After all, I've been eating here for years, since the beginning, often after drinking. It is convenient. The service is good. The location is good. The food is terribly inconsistent, though. Sometimes it is tasty; but more often, it's terrible. A common problem is a general lack of seasoning. Occasionally, the meats have a rubbery texture, which is off-putting. The I've had bland, undercooked beans and bland, undercooked rice. The bacon lardons are almost never properly rendered, which makes them extremely unpleasant to eat. When you order a High Roller Burrito, and it is not executed well, it makes you feel poor. To be fair, the medium red salsa, pickled red onions, guacamole, and sweet potato puree are all very good. Regardless, I'll probably be making my own burritos, at home, instead."
Burrito Drive,black beans,"I would give this place 5 stars but it's to hit or miss. The flavors are always spot on. Just sometimes if you order a burrito you either get a nice amount of meat, or just rice and beans. And for $10 a burrito I want my F-ing meat."
Burrito Drive,black beans,"Ahh...my 500th review.  I put a lot of thought and consideration into which establishment I would review and after my midnight visit on a Sunday night, this floated to the top.  Burrito has stood the test of time (they have been open for as long as I can remember) and their 3 am close time have accommodated my oft inebriated self.  On Sunday night, my girlfriend and I were coming from a long Seattle weekend (and flight) and needed something quick and good.  Enter Burrito Drive.  Yes, at times, I think the quality suffers depending on the kitchen and the time but Sunday night, they were firing on all cylinders.  Having already wrecked any sense of healthy eating in Seattle, I opted for the White Trash Burrito-White Trash Burrito-Spam, tater tots, baked beans and spicy ketchup on the side.  Their burritos carry a definite heft and was exactly I was looking for-Filling with a side of guilt.  Spam never tasted as good. My better half ordered the Steak and ""Eggs"" burrito complete with Carne asada, rice, queso fresco,pickled red onion and hollandaise sauce.  This isn't your mom's Chipotle concoction.  There wasn't much talking as we ate in our kitchen so it must have been all right (or maybe because we were both exhausted).  Either way, we had no left overs so it worked out.
For those that rather gorge at home, they also have a huge delivery area. Definitely try them out!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,tamale,"The tacos here are tasty!  I'm glad I decided to give this place a try.  This location used to be La Guanajuatence, which had an amazing salsa bar and delicious tacos.  This new restaurant doesn't boast a salsa bar and the salsa they serve with the chips is mediocre, but the tacos are still tasty.  

I ordered the carne asada taco, chorizo taco, lengua taco and a chicken tamale with onions and cilantro on everything. They brought out a smoky salsa in a squeeze tube with the tacos.  The lengua taco was delicious.  The beef tongue was tender and juicy.  The chorizo taco was full of flavor.  Chorizo can be very greasy but I felt that this was just right for me.  Everything was ordered a la carte, so no rice and no beans and that's just how I prefer it.  

The only thing I was not a fan of the chicken tamale.  I found it too heavy in the masa and light on the filling. It felt dry, and I wouldn't order it again.  It's a shame because apparently the market in the same plaza makes amazing tamales on the weekends.  

I haven't tried other things on the menu, and honestly, I probably never will.  Tacos are what I love and I almost never want anything else."
Taqueria El Jalapeño,tamale,"I really enjoy coming to this little place! It's hard to find, especially now with all the construction but it's worth the adventure! We came on a Sunday evening and were one of only two couples there. We received menus and our order of chips and salsa while we decided. I ordered flautas and the SO ordered chimichangas, and we split a tamale. All the meat we chose was chicken and it had a really good flavor. The tamale had too much masa for our liking but the flautas and chimis were really flavorful. The salsa is fresh and has a good flavor, not spicy at all. Adding the hot sauce will definitely give it the kick you need! I enjoy how quick the service is, how servers leave you to eat and how overall this place is all about the food, no fuss about extra things. Just a tip, they prefer cash!"
Taqueria El Jalapeño,tamale,"Okay so I moved to madison about 5 years ago and ever since I have been on the hunt for good authentic mexican food. I think I've finally found it. My boyfriend and I decided to order it for delivery (that's one of the downsides is that the delivery service is slow...takes about hour to an hour and a half to get your food) anyways. The first time we ordered, our food arrived cold which isn't the restaurants fault it's the service but even though it was cold it was still good! How does that even happen?! We always get a Pollo taco, a tamale, guacamole and flautas. The chicken is sometimes a little dry but once you throw some hot salsa on it, it's fine. All in all I like it and can appreciate that they prepare the tacos traditionally. (Corn tortillas, cilantro and onion yummy!!!)"
El Bolillo Bakery,burrito,"I HATE writing bad reviews,  but some things are what they are. Easy access from my office,  friendly staff, and the salsa was herbaceous and fresh. However, for over $7 a burrito and pubpar meat, I can't show much love. Shit, I grill and make badassery all the time and I KNOW that the cook wouldn't eat that gristle himself or service it tonhis family! Travel a minute south and order the same at La Rosita, much better quality and save $2."
Brothers Three Bar & Grill,bottled of water,Terrible breakfast experience. We went on a Saturday morning and arrived a few minutes after 10.  We didn't actually get our food until 11. The food was OK and the coffee was bad but the bloody Mary was the worst one I have ever had. Thin and runny without any seasoning it tasted like a glass of water with pink food coloring. Every other table had half emptied glasses of it left behind because no one finished them.
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic hummus and potter's organic crackers,Slow service. No napkins. Hummus was bland and the crackers were plain and grainy. Ordered the Hot-Wa-ii and was met with bland and unflavored pizza. Doused in Parmesan and red pepper flakes it became edible. No real saving grace here. Avoid this place.
The Roman Candle Pizzeria,garlic hummus and potter's organic crackers,"Preface: MY FAVORITE FOOD/DRINK IN THE WHOLE WORLD IS PIZZA AND BEER..... THEY HAVE BOTH. Please pay special attention to the ""you might also consider"" bar right above this review and go anywhere but here..... Service is non-existent... Food is not good.... I really can't be more disappointed. I have had two terrible experiences here and I'm happy to say I've had my last."
Edo Garden Monona,flying fish roe,"I have to admit, I'm so glad that I decided to go get sushi with my friends yesterday afternoon here, because my initial impression of Edo Garden from my delivery order wasn't pretty. 

When I ordered delivery from here (which I realize is kind of a gamble with sushi, because it gets to sit in a car for who-knows-how-long and then it's delicate construction can get undone with all the bumps) I wasn't sure what I would get. The order ended up coming within the time range that was promised, but the food was just...........mediocre. The sushi had come undone, the taste was bland/almost too fishy (and I love raw fish sushi!) and the miso soup was kind of gross. So, I had pretty much taken this place off my rotation of sushi places in Madison.

BUT, my experience last night of dining in, in person, actually made me optimistic about coming back! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is pleasing with an almost upscale pan-Asian decor, but not fancy enough where I felt out of place wearing flip-flops and a t-shirt, and the food presentation was wonderful, with the plate types and good quality chop sticks. I ordered 4 rolls, a side of fried gyoza, the miso soup, and two Mai Tai cocktails - and all of them I can say were delightful!

The Mai Tais were strong, fruity, and nicely-sized for $7.50 each - I'll be back just for these! 

The sushi I got definitely had fresh-tasting raw fish on them, and the tempura-based sushi roll I got was light and crisp, and the miso soup was much better dining in than it was via delivery.
Also, when you get delivery, they give you those fake soy sauce packets versus real soy sauce on the table when you dine in, which makes a huge difference for sushi. 

My friends both got the bento boxes for dinner and they had a pretty generous portion of each of the sections and they looked delish - the tempura shrimp pieces were huge!!

Final verdict: definitely will be back, for both the friendly and quick service, and the awesome Mai Tais and delicious food."
Edo Garden Monona,flying fish roe,"Overall, not a terrible experience. I prefer Takumi on almost all fronts, however. From the miso to the sushi. Some of the more specialty rolls here may be good, but I haven't tried them (they were a bit expensive for my tastes, so i skipped over them quickly). The Tokyo roll and tuna roll I ordered were good but not amazing. The fish was too room-temperature for my tastes, almost a bit gaggy, actually. The miso tasted like it was missing something, salt, maybe? I don't know, but I didn't finish it, and I usually can't get enough miso.

Three stars (instead of my gut-instinct of 2) because the service was actually excellent. The waiter gave me a lunch special even though one of the rolls I ordered was not supposed to be eligible for the combo, and was extremely attentive and friendly. Though, I was one of only two tables in the place over an after-lunchtime lull, so that may have had something to do with it, as well as me being a not-too-terribly-hideous woman eating by myself...come to think of it, he was probably hitting on me the whole time and i was just sitting there thinking, ""dang, the service here is excellent!""  dummy me...

If sushi is the menu of choice, i'll be at takumi, hands down. and I'll have to agree with Aftee in one of the other reviews: the empty pond thing right as you walk in the door is a little off-putting."
Edo Garden Monona,flying fish roe,"Nice friendly service, horrible, horrible sushi. The rice was gooey like rice pudding. We were hungry enough to finish the various old and tough fish pieces, but we're paying for it today,, very sick. Never again."
Edo Garden Monona,flying fish roe,"So i've been here a few times. I want to like this place because its close to my work & home. So i figured I would try one last time and hope to really like Edo. Sorry.. but I am just not a big fan of the sushi here..  It just seems as if its missing something... Same with the beef yakisoba it had no spice.. no pizzaz. 

Another thing that was ""missing"" in my last carry out order was the darn CHOPSTICKS?  Come on isn't that the norm to get some sticks with your take out order?  Oh.. wait I got a couple plastic forks! Maybe someone is trying to save a few bucks.. but next time ask me if i want a fork or chopsticks?  I need those suckers. Especially at the rate the sushi is going for.

One more thing..  I am just wondering what's up with the ""pond"" thats drained? Its on the left when you walk into the building? Can't miss it.. Someone please fill that sucker up with some water and koi fish!  Its been empty since the first time I dined there years ago. That would add a little flare to the rather empty feeling when you first walk in..."
Edo Garden Monona,flying fish roe,"When I am eating raw fish I expect the place I am eating it from to be immaculate or I start getting a little freaked out.The place needs a remodel; the floor was uneven, the tables and chairs banged up, and there was also a gnat that wouldn't leave me alone. All of this lead to me thinking/feeling is this sushi safe to be eating!?. The place really needs some TLC! The menu was big. I liked that they had pictures of the specialty rolls. When the sushi came it was all good but nothing to write home about. Prices were reasonable."
Silver Mine Subs,1. bacon breakfast burrito,"First time visit to this sub shop.  It's about a half mile from my new office, so I had to try it out my first week.  I ordered a customized Georgetown sub.  It was a sad little sub. There was literally one thin slice of turkey deli meat on the sandwich, with a tiny sliver of cheese, tasteless bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado paste.  Definitely not a quality sandwich or satisfying meal.  This place gets credit for easy online ordering and delivery until 3am.  But honestly, if I'm hungry in middle of the night, I'm quite certain I would not order from this place!"
Silver Mine Subs,1. bacon breakfast burrito,Checked this place out because we had some coupons. My boyfriend and I ordered a cripple creek and a buffalo chicken sandwich both on wheat. Both were supposed to be hot. We got home and neither were hot (we live less than 2 miles away.. I expected at very least mildly warm) and both were on white bread. My sandwich also came without bacon like noted. The sandwich was decent but with so many things wrong with our order I doubt we'll go back.
